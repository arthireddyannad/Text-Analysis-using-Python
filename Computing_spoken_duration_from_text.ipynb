Some years ago\\xe2\\x80\\x94never mind how long precisely\\xe2\\x80\\x94 having little or\\r\\nno money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought\\r\\nI would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I\\r\\nhave of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find\\r\\nmyself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in\\r\\nmy soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses,\\r\\nand bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my\\r\\nhypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle\\r\\nto prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically\\r\\nknocking people\\'s hats off\\xe2\\x80\\x94then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon\\r\\nas I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical\\r\\nflourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There\\r\\nis nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their\\r\\ndegree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the\\r\\nocean with me.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as\\r\\nIndian isles by coral reefs\\xe2\\x80\\x94commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and\\r\\nleft, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery,\\r\\nwhere that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few\\r\\nhours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers\\r\\nthere.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCircumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to\\r\\nCoenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you\\r\\nsee?\\xe2\\x80\\x94Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon\\r\\nthousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the\\r\\nspiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks\\r\\nglasses! of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to\\r\\nget a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent\\r\\nup in lath and plaster\\xe2\\x80\\x94 tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks.\\r\\nHow then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly\\r\\nbound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of\\r\\nthe land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice.\\r\\nNo. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling\\r\\nin. And there they stand\\xe2\\x80\\x94miles of them\\xe2\\x80\\x94leagues. Inlanders all, they come from\\r\\nlanes and alleys, streets and avenues,\\xe2\\x80\\x94 north, east, south, and west. Yet here\\r\\nthey all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the\\r\\ncompasses of all those ships attract them thither?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOnce more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost\\r\\nany path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves\\r\\nyou there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most\\r\\nabsent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries\\xe2\\x80\\x94stand that man on his\\r\\nlegs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water\\r\\nthere be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American\\r\\ndesert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a\\r\\nmetaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are\\r\\nwedded for ever.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,\\r\\nquietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the\\r\\nSaco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a\\r\\nhollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his\\r\\nmeadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy\\r\\nsmoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping\\r\\nspurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies\\r\\nthus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon\\r\\nthis shepherd\\'s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd\\'s eye were fixed\\r\\nupon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for\\r\\nscores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies\\xe2\\x80\\x94what is the one\\r\\ncharm wanting?\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Water there is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a\\r\\ncataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the\\r\\npoor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver,\\r\\ndeliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his\\r\\nmoney in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust\\r\\nhealthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to\\r\\ngo to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel\\r\\nsuch a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out\\r\\nof sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the\\r\\nGreeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is\\r\\nnot without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus,\\r\\nwho because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the\\r\\nfountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves\\r\\nsee in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of\\r\\nlife; and this is the key to it all.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow\\r\\nhazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean\\r\\nto have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a\\r\\npassenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have\\r\\nsomething in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick\\xe2\\x80\\x94 grow quarrelsome\\xe2\\x80\\x94don\\'t sleep\\r\\nof nights\\xe2\\x80\\x94do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;\\xe2\\x80\\x94no, I never go as a\\r\\npassenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a\\r\\nCommodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such\\r\\noffices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable\\r\\nrespectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is\\r\\nquite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships,\\r\\nbarques, brigs, schooners, and what not. And as for going as cook,\\xe2\\x80\\x94though I\\r\\nconfess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on\\r\\nship-board\\xe2\\x80\\x94yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;\\xe2\\x80\\x94though once broiled,\\r\\njudiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one\\r\\nwho will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl\\r\\nthan I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon\\r\\nbroiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies of those\\r\\ncreatures in their huge bakehouses the pyramids.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNo, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb\\r\\ndown into the fore-castle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they\\r\\nrather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a\\r\\ngrasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant\\r\\nenough. It touches one\\'s sense of honor, particularly if you come of an old\\r\\nestablished family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or\\r\\nHardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the\\r\\ntar-pot, you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest\\r\\nboys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a\\r\\nschoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the\\r\\nStoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off in time.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhat of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and\\r\\nsweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in\\r\\nthe scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks\\r\\nanything the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old\\r\\nhunks in that particular instance? Who ain\\'t a slave? Tell me that. Well, then,\\r\\nhowever the old sea-captains may order me about\\xe2\\x80\\x94however they may thump and\\r\\npunch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that\\r\\neverybody else is one way or other served in much the same way\\xe2\\x80\\x94 either in a\\r\\nphysical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is\\r\\npassed round, and all hands should rub each other\\'s shoulder-blades, and be\\r\\ncontent.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAgain, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying me\\r\\nfor my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever\\r\\nheard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And there is all the\\r\\ndifference in the world between paying and being paid. The act of paying is\\r\\nperhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed\\r\\nupon us. But being paid,\\xe2\\x80\\x94 what will compare with it? The urbane activity with\\r\\nwhich a man receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so\\r\\nearnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no\\r\\naccount can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves\\r\\nto perdition!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFinally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise and\\r\\npure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world, head winds are far more\\r\\nprevalent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean\\r\\nmaxim), so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his\\r\\natmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he\\r\\nbreathes it first; but not so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead\\r\\ntheir leaders in many other things, at the same time that the leaders little\\r\\nsuspect it. But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as\\r\\na merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage;\\r\\nthis the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the constant\\r\\nsurveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some\\r\\nunaccountable way\\xe2\\x80\\x94 he can better answer than any one else. And, doubtless, my\\r\\ngoing on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand programme of Providence\\r\\nthat was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and\\r\\nsolo between more extensive performances.

Then the wild\\r\\nand distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless\\r\\nperils of the whale; these, with all the attending marvels of a thousand\\r\\nPatagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish. With other men,\\r\\nperhaps, such things would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am\\r\\ntormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden\\r\\nseas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to\\r\\nperceive a horror, and could still be social with it\\xe2\\x80\\x94would they let me\\xe2\\x80\\x94since it\\r\\nis but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one\\r\\nlodges in.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great\\r\\nflood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits that\\r\\nswayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost soul, endless\\r\\nprocessions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand hooded phantom,\\r\\nlike a snow hill in the air.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 2</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Carpet-Bag\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm, and\\r\\nstarted for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city of old Manhatto,\\r\\nI duly arrived in New Bedford. It was on a Saturday night in December. Much was\\r\\nI disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already\\r\\nsailed, and that no way of reaching that place would offer, till the following\\r\\nMonday.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this\\r\\nsame New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well be related\\r\\nthat I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was made up to sail in no\\r\\nother than a Nantucket craft, because there was a fine, boisterous something\\r\\nabout everything connected with that famous old island, which amazingly pleased\\r\\nme. Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolizing the\\r\\nbusiness of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much\\r\\nbehind her, yet Nantucket was her great original\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the Tyre of this\\r\\nCarthage;\\xe2\\x80\\x94the place where the first dead American whale was stranded. Where\\r\\nelse but from Nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally\\r\\nout in canoes to give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket,\\r\\ntoo, did that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with\\r\\nimported cobblestones\\xe2\\x80\\x94so goes the story\\xe2\\x80\\x94 to throw at the whales, in order to\\r\\ndiscover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in New\\r\\nBedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter of\\r\\nconcernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a very\\r\\ndubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and\\r\\ncheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had sounded my\\r\\npocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,\\xe2\\x80\\x94So, wherever you go,\\r\\nIshmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street\\r\\nshouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness\\r\\ntowards the south\\xe2\\x80\\x94wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the\\r\\nnight, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the price, and don\\'t be too\\r\\nparticular.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWith halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of \"The Crossed\\r\\nHarpoons\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further on, from the\\r\\nbright red windows of the \"Sword-Fish Inn,\" there came such fervent rays, that\\r\\nit seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house, for\\r\\neverywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic\\r\\npavement,\\xe2\\x80\\x94rather weary for me, when I struck my foot against the flinty\\r\\nprojections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were\\r\\nin a most miserable plight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing\\r\\none moment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of the\\r\\ntinkling glasses within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don\\'t you hear?\\r\\nget away from before the door; your patched boots are stopping the way. So on I\\r\\nwent. I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward, for there,\\r\\ndoubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSuch dreary streets! Blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand, and here\\r\\nand there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At this hour of the\\r\\nnight, of the last day of the week, that quarter of the town proved all but\\r\\ndeserted. But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low, wide\\r\\nbuilding, the door of which stood invitingly open. It had a careless look, as\\r\\nif it were meant for the uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I\\r\\ndid was to stumble over an ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the\\r\\nflying particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city,\\r\\nGomorrah? But \"The Crossed Harpoons,\" and the \"The Sword-Fish?\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94this, then must\\r\\nneeds be the sign of \"The Trap.\" However, I picked myself up and hearing a loud\\r\\nvoice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior door.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black faces\\r\\nturned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of Doom was\\r\\nbeating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the preacher\\'s text was\\r\\nabout the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing\\r\\nthere. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out, Wretched entertainment at the sign\\r\\nof \\'The Trap!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMoving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks, and\\r\\nheard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a swinging sign over\\r\\nthe door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing a tall straight\\r\\njet of misty spray, and these words underneath\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"The Spouter Inn:\\xe2\\x80\\x94Peter Coffin.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCoffin?\\xe2\\x80\\x94Spouter?\\xe2\\x80\\x94Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought I. But it\\r\\nis a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this Peter here is an\\r\\nemigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and the place, for the time,\\r\\nlooked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as\\r\\nif it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district, and as\\r\\nthe swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that\\r\\nhere was the very spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was a queer sort of place\\xe2\\x80\\x94a gable-ended old house, one side palsied as it\\r\\nwere, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner, where that\\r\\ntempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor\\r\\nPaul\\'s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to\\r\\nany one in-doors, with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed. In judging\\r\\nof that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon,\" says an old writer\\xe2\\x80\\x94of whose works\\r\\nI possess the only copy extant\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou\\r\\nlookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or\\r\\nwhether thou observest it from that sashless window, where the frost is on both\\r\\nsides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier.\" True enough, thought\\r\\nI, as this passage occurred to my mind\\xe2\\x80\\x94old black-letter, thou reasonest well.\\r\\nYes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity\\r\\nthey didn\\'t stop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little\\r\\nlint here and there. But it\\'s too late to make any improvements now. The\\r\\nuniverse is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a\\r\\nmillion years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the\\r\\ncurbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he\\r\\nmight plug up both ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet\\r\\nthat would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives,\\r\\nin his red silken wrapper\\xe2\\x80\\x94(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a\\r\\nfine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of\\r\\ntheir oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the\\r\\nprivilege of making my own summer with my own coals.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the\\r\\ngrand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here? Would\\r\\nhe not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator; yea,\\r\\nye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in order to keep out this frost?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of\\r\\nDives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of\\r\\nthe Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a Czar in an ice palace made\\r\\nof frozen sighs, and being a president of a temperance society, he only drinks\\r\\nthe tepid tears of orphans.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there is plenty\\r\\nof that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet, and see what\\r\\nsort of a place this \"Spouter\" may be.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 3</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Spouter-Inn\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEntering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide, low,\\r\\nstraggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of\\r\\nsome condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large oil painting so\\r\\nthoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the unequal crosslights by\\r\\nwhich you viewed it, it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic\\r\\nvisits to it, and careful inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way\\r\\narrive at an understanding of its purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades\\r\\nand shadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in\\r\\nthe time of the New England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched.\\r\\nBut by dint of much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and\\r\\nespecially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry,\\r\\nyou at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild, might not\\r\\nbe altogether unwarranted.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous, black\\r\\nmass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue, dim,\\r\\nperpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy\\r\\npicture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort\\r\\nof indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze\\r\\nyou to it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what\\r\\nthat marvellous painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive\\r\\nidea would dart you through.\\xe2\\x80\\x94 It\\'s the Black Sea in a midnight gale.\\xe2\\x80\\x94It\\'s the\\r\\nunnatural combat of the four primal elements.\\xe2\\x80\\x94It\\'s a blasted heath.\\xe2\\x80\\x94 It\\'s a\\r\\nHyperborean winter scene.\\xe2\\x80\\x94It\\'s the breaking-up of the icebound stream of Time.\\r\\nBut at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the\\r\\npicture\\'s midst. That once found out, and all the rest were plain. But stop;\\r\\ndoes it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish? even the great\\r\\nleviathan himself?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn fact, the artist\\'s design seemed this: a final theory of my own, partly\\r\\nbased upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I conversed\\r\\nupon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a great hurricane;\\r\\nthe half-foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone\\r\\nvisible; and an exasperated whale, purposing to spring clean over the craft, is\\r\\nin the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of\\r\\nmonstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with glittering teeth\\r\\nresembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of human hair; and one was\\r\\nsickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the\\r\\nnew-mown grass by a long-armed mower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered\\r\\nwhat monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with\\r\\nsuch a hacking, horrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling\\r\\nlances and harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With\\r\\nthis once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill\\r\\nfifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that harpoon\\xe2\\x80\\x94so like a\\r\\ncorkscrew now\\xe2\\x80\\x94was flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years\\r\\nafterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The original iron entered nigh the\\r\\ntail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man, travelled\\r\\nfull forty feet, and at last was found imbedded in the hump.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCrossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way\\xe2\\x80\\x94 cut through what\\r\\nin old times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all\\r\\nround\\xe2\\x80\\x94you enter the public room. A still duskier place is this, with such low\\r\\nponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled planks beneath, that you would\\r\\nalmost fancy you trod some old craft\\'s cockpits, especially of such a howling\\r\\nnight, when this corner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood\\r\\na long, low, shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with\\r\\ndusty rarities gathered from this wide world\\'s remotest nooks. Projecting from\\r\\nthe further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den\\xe2\\x80\\x94the bar\\xe2\\x80\\x94a rude attempt\\r\\nat a right whale\\'s head. Be that how it may, there stands the vast arched bone\\r\\nof the whale\\'s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive beneath it. Within are\\r\\nshabby shelves, ranged round with old decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those\\r\\njaws of swift destruction, like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they\\r\\ncalled him), bustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly\\r\\nsells the sailors deliriums and death.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAbominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true\\r\\ncylinders without\\xe2\\x80\\x94within, the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully\\r\\ntapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians rudely pecked into\\r\\nthe glass, surround these footpads\\' goblets. Fill to this mark, and your charge\\r\\nis but a penny; to this a penny more; and so on to the full glass\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the Cape\\r\\nHorn measure, which you may gulp down for a shilling.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nUpon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about a\\r\\ntable, examining by a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander. I sought the\\r\\nlandlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a room, received\\r\\nfor answer that his house was full\\xe2\\x80\\x94 not a bed unoccupied. \"But avast,\" he\\r\\nadded, tapping his forehead, \"you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer\\'s\\r\\nblanket, have ye? I s\\'pose you are goin\\' a-whalin\\', so you\\'d better get used to\\r\\nthat sort of thing.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should ever do\\r\\nso, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that if he (the\\r\\nlandlord) really had no other place for me, and the harpooneer was not\\r\\ndecidedly objectionable, why rather than wander further about a strange town on\\r\\nso bitter a night, I would put up with the half of any decent man\\'s blanket.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?\\xe2\\x80\\x94you want supper?<br>\\r\\nSupper\\'ll be ready directly.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the\\r\\nBattery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his\\r\\njack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his\\r\\nlegs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but he didn\\'t make much\\r\\nheadway, I thought.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room.\\r\\nIt was cold as Iceland\\xe2\\x80\\x94 no fire at all\\xe2\\x80\\x94the landlord said he couldn\\'t afford it.\\r\\nNothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a winding sheet. We were fain to\\r\\nbutton up our monkey jackets, and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with\\r\\nour half frozen fingers. But the fare was of the most substantial kind\\xe2\\x80\\x94not only\\r\\nmeat and potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young\\r\\nfellow in a green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most\\r\\ndireful manner.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"My boy,\" said the landlord, \"you\\'ll have the nightmare to a dead sartainty.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Landlord,\" I whispered, \"that aint the harpooneer is it?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Oh, no,\" said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, \"the harpooneer is a\\r\\ndark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he don\\'t\\xe2\\x80\\x94 he eats nothing but\\r\\nsteaks, and he likes \\'em rare.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"The devil he does,\" says I. \"Where is that harpooneer?<br>\\r\\nIs he here?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"He\\'ll be here afore long,\" was the answer.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this \"dark complexioned\"\\r\\nharpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so turned out that we\\r\\nshould sleep together, he must undress and get into bed before I did.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSupper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not what else\\r\\nto do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the evening as a looker on.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPresently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord cried,\\r\\n\"That\\'s the Grampus\\'s crew. I seed her reported in the offing this morning; a\\r\\nthree years\\' voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now we\\'ll have the latest\\r\\nnews from the Feegees.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung open, and in\\r\\nrolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their shaggy watch coats,\\r\\nand with their heads muffled in woollen comforters, all bedarned and ragged,\\r\\nand their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from\\r\\nLabrador. They had just landed from their boat, and this was the first house\\r\\nthey entered. No wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the whale\\'s\\r\\nmouth\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the bar\\xe2\\x80\\x94when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon\\r\\npoured them out brimmers all round. One complained of a bad cold in his head,\\r\\nupon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he\\r\\nswore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of\\r\\nhow long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the\\r\\nweather side of an ice-island.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even with the\\r\\narrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began capering about most\\r\\nobstreperously.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though he seemed\\r\\ndesirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face, yet\\r\\nupon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest. This man\\r\\ninterested me at once; and since the sea-gods had ordained that he should soon\\r\\nbecome my shipmate (though but a sleeping partner one, so far as this narrative\\r\\nis concerned), I will here venture upon a little description of him. He stood\\r\\nfull six feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I\\r\\nhave seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and burnt,\\r\\nmaking his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep shadows of\\r\\nhis eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy. His\\r\\nvoice at once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I\\r\\nthought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in\\r\\nVirginia. When the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this\\r\\nman slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade\\r\\non the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and\\r\\nbeing, it seems, for some reason a huge favorite with them, they raised a cry\\r\\nof \"Bulkington! Bulkington! where\\'s Bulkington?\" and darted out of the house in\\r\\npursuit of him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was now about nine o\\'clock, and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet\\r\\nafter these orgies, I began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had\\r\\noccurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNo man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal rather not\\r\\nsleep with your own brother. I don\\'t know how it is, but people like to be\\r\\nprivate when they are sleeping. And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown\\r\\nstranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town, and that stranger a harpooneer,\\r\\nthen your objections indefinitely multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason\\r\\nwhy I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for\\r\\nsailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be\\r\\nsure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock,\\r\\nand cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the thought of\\r\\nsleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a harpooneer, his linen or\\r\\nwoollen, as the case might be, would not be of the tidiest, certainly none of\\r\\nthe finest. I began to twitch all over. Besides, it was getting late, and my\\r\\ndecent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should\\r\\ntumble in upon me at midnight\\xe2\\x80\\x94 how could I tell from what vile hole he had been\\r\\ncoming?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Landlord! I\\'ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.\\xe2\\x80\\x94<br>\\r\\nI shan\\'t sleep with him. I\\'ll try the bench here.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Just as you please; I\\'m sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress, and\\r\\nit\\'s a plaguy rough board here\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94feeling of the knots and notches. \"But wait a\\r\\nbit, Skrimshander; I\\'ve got a carpenter\\'s plane there in the bar\\xe2\\x80\\x94wait, I say,\\r\\nand I\\'ll make ye snug enough.\" So saying he procured the plane; and with his\\r\\nold silk handkerchief first dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away\\r\\nat my bed, the while grinning like an ape. The shavings flew right and left;\\r\\ntill at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The\\r\\nlandlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven\\'s sake to\\r\\nquit\\xe2\\x80\\x94the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing\\r\\nin the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the\\r\\nshavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in the\\r\\nmiddle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a brown study.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too short;\\r\\nbut that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too narrow, and the\\r\\nother bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed one\\xe2\\x80\\x94 so\\r\\nthere was no yoking them. I then placed the first bench lengthwise along the\\r\\nonly clear space against the wall, leaving a little interval between, for my\\r\\nback to settle down in. But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold\\r\\nair over me from under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at\\r\\nall, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the\\r\\nwindow, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate\\r\\nvicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn\\'t I steal a march\\r\\non him\\xe2\\x80\\x94bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be wakened by the\\r\\nmost violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea but upon second thoughts I\\r\\ndismissed it. For who could tell but what the next morning, so soon as I popped\\r\\nout of the room, the harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to\\r\\nknock me down!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nStill looking around me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending a\\r\\nsufferable night unless in some other person\\'s bed, I began to think that after\\r\\nall I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown\\r\\nharpooneer. Thinks I, I\\'ll wait awhile; he must be dropping in before long.\\r\\nI\\'ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may become jolly good\\r\\nbedfellows after all\\xe2\\x80\\x94there\\'s no telling.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes, and\\r\\ngoing to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Landlord! said I, \"what sort of a chap is he\\xe2\\x80\\x94does he always keep such late\\r\\nhours?\" It was now hard upon twelve o\\'clock.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be mightily\\r\\ntickled at something beyond my comprehension. \"No,\" he answered, \"generally\\r\\nhe\\'s an early bird\\xe2\\x80\\x94airley to bed and airley to rise\\xe2\\x80\\x94yea, he\\'s the bird what\\r\\ncatches the worm. But to-night he went out a peddling, you see, and I don\\'t see\\r\\nwhat on airth keeps him so late, unless, may be, he can\\'t sell his head.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Can\\'t sell his head?\\xe2\\x80\\x94What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling\\r\\nme?\" getting into a towering rage. \"Do you pretend to say, landlord, that this\\r\\nharpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday night, or rather Sunday\\r\\nmorning, in peddling his head around this town?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"That\\'s precisely it,\" said the landlord, \"and I told him he couldn\\'t sell it\\r\\nhere, the market\\'s overstocked.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"With what?\" shouted I.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"With heads to be sure; ain\\'t there too many heads in the world?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I tell you what it is, landlord,\" said I quite calmly, \"you\\'d better stop\\r\\nspinning that yarn to me\\xe2\\x80\\x94I\\'m not green.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"May be not,\" taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, \"but I rayther\\r\\nguess you\\'ll be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin\\' his\\r\\nhead.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I\\'ll break it for him,\" said I, now flying into a passion again at this\\r\\nunaccountable farrago of the landlord\\'s.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"It\\'s broke a\\'ready,\" said he.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Broke,\" said I\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"broke, do you mean?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Sartain, and that\\'s the very reason he can\\'t sell it, I guess.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Landlord,\" said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a\\r\\nsnowstorm\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"landlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one another, and\\r\\nthat too without delay. I come to your house and want a bed; you tell me you\\r\\ncan only give me half a one; that the other half belongs to a certain\\r\\nharpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have not yet seen, you persist in\\r\\ntelling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me\\r\\nan uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow\\xe2\\x80\\x94a\\r\\nsort of connexion, landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the\\r\\nhighest degree. I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this\\r\\nharpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the night\\r\\nwith him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay that story\\r\\nabout selling his head, which if true I take to be good evidence that this\\r\\nharpooneer is stark mad, and I\\'ve no idea of sleeping with a madman; and you,\\r\\nsir, you I mean, landlord, you, sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly\\r\\nwould thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Wall,\" said the landlord, fetching a long breath, \"that\\'s a purty long sarmon\\r\\nfor a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be easy, this here\\r\\nharpooneer I have been tellin\\' you of has just arrived from the south seas,\\r\\nwhere he bought up a lot of \\'balmed New Zealand heads (great curios, you know),\\r\\nand he\\'s sold all on \\'em but one, and that one he\\'s trying to sell to-night,\\r\\ncause to-morrow\\'s Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin\\' human heads about\\r\\nthe streets when folks is goin\\' to churches. He wanted to last Sunday, but I\\r\\nstopped him just as he was goin\\' out of the door with four heads strung on a\\r\\nstring, for all the airth like a string of inions.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThis account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed that\\r\\nthe landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me\\xe2\\x80\\x94 but at the same time\\r\\nwhat could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a Saturday night clean\\r\\ninto the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads\\r\\nof dead idolators?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"He pays reg\\'lar,\" was the rejoinder. \"But come, it\\'s getting dreadful late,\\r\\nyou had better be turning flukes\\xe2\\x80\\x94it\\'s a nice bed: Sal and me slept in that ere\\r\\nbed the night we were spliced. There\\'s plenty of room for two to kick about in\\r\\nthat bed; it\\'s an almighty big bed that. Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to\\r\\nput our Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it. But I got a dreaming and\\r\\nsprawling about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came\\r\\nnear breaking his arm. After that, Sal said it wouldn\\'t do. Come along here,\\r\\nI\\'ll give ye a glim in a jiffy;\" and so saying he lighted a candle and held it\\r\\ntowards me, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a\\r\\nclock in the corner, he exclaimed \"I vum it\\'s Sunday\\xe2\\x80\\x94you won\\'t see that\\r\\nharpooneer to-night; he\\'s come to anchor somewhere\\xe2\\x80\\x94come along then; do come;\\r\\nwon\\'t ye come?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was ushered\\r\\ninto a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough, with a\\r\\nprodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep\\r\\nabreast.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"There,\" said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that\\r\\ndid double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; \"there, make yourself\\r\\ncomfortable now; and good night to ye.\" I turned round from eyeing the bed, but\\r\\nhe had disappeared.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFolding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of the most\\r\\nelegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced round the\\r\\nroom; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see no other furniture\\r\\nbelonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four walls, and a papered\\r\\nfireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of things not properly belonging\\r\\nto the room, there was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one\\r\\ncorner; also a large seaman\\'s bag, containing the harpooneer\\'s wardrobe, no\\r\\ndoubt in lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone\\r\\nfish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the\\r\\nhead of the bed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the light,\\r\\nand felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive at some\\r\\nsatisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to nothing but a large\\r\\ndoor mat, ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the\\r\\nstained porcupine quills round an Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in\\r\\nthe middle of this mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos. But\\r\\ncould it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and\\r\\nparade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to\\r\\ntry it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and\\r\\nthick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer had\\r\\nbeen wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against\\r\\nthe wall, and I never saw such a sight in my life. I tore myself out of it in\\r\\nsuch a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\\r\\nhead-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on the\\r\\nbed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in the middle\\r\\nof the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a little more in my\\r\\nshirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now, half undressed as I was,\\r\\nand remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneer\\'s not coming home\\r\\nat all that night, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of\\r\\nmy pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and\\r\\ncommended myself to the care of heaven.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhether that mattress was stuffed with corncobs or broken crockery, there is no\\r\\ntelling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep for a long time.\\r\\nAt last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty nearly made a good offing\\r\\ntowards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw\\r\\na glimmer of light come into the room from under the door.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal head-peddler.\\r\\nBut I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word till spoken to.\\r\\nHolding a light in one hand, and that identical New Zealand head in the other,\\r\\nthe stranger entered the room, and without looking towards the bed, placed his\\r\\ncandle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner, and then began\\r\\nworking away at the knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being\\r\\nin the room. I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for\\r\\nsome time while employed in unlacing the bag\\'s mouth. This accomplished,\\r\\nhowever, he turned round\\xe2\\x80\\x94when, good heavens; what a sight! Such a face! It was\\r\\nof a dark, purplish, yellow color, here and there stuck over with large\\r\\nblackish looking squares. Yes, it\\'s just as I thought, he\\'s a terrible\\r\\nbedfellow; he\\'s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from\\r\\nthe surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the\\r\\nlight, that I plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those\\r\\nblack squares on his cheeks. They were stains of some sort or other. At first I\\r\\nknew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me.\\r\\nI remembered a story of a white man\\xe2\\x80\\x94a whaleman too\\xe2\\x80\\x94 who, falling among the\\r\\ncannibals, had been tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the\\r\\ncourse of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And what\\r\\nis it, thought I, after all! It\\'s only his outside; a man can be honest in any\\r\\nsort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly complexion, that part of\\r\\nit, I mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the squares of\\r\\ntattooing. To be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning;\\r\\nbut I never heard of a hot sun\\'s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow\\r\\none. However, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there\\r\\nproduced these extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas\\r\\nwere passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at\\r\\nall. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in\\r\\nit, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with\\r\\nthe hair on. Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he then\\r\\ntook the New Zealand head\\xe2\\x80\\x94a ghastly thing enough\\xe2\\x80\\x94 and crammed it down into the\\r\\nbag. He now took off his hat\\xe2\\x80\\x94 a new beaver hat\\xe2\\x80\\x94when I came nigh singing out\\r\\nwith fresh surprise. There was no hair on his head\\xe2\\x80\\x94none to speak of at least\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\nnothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish\\r\\nhead now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger\\r\\nstood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker than ever\\r\\nI bolted a dinner.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEven as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but it was\\r\\nthe second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this headpeddling\\r\\npurple rascal altogether passed my comprehension. Ignorance is the parent of\\r\\nfear, and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I\\r\\nconfess I was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had\\r\\nthus broken into my room at the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him\\r\\nthat I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory\\r\\nanswer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMeanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed his\\r\\nchest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered with the\\r\\nsame squares as his face, his back, too, was all over the same dark squares; he\\r\\nseemed to have been in a Thirty Years\\' War, and just escaped from it with a\\r\\nsticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel\\r\\nof dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite\\r\\nplain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a\\r\\nwhaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked\\r\\nto think of it. A peddler of heads too\\xe2\\x80\\x94perhaps the heads of his own brothers.\\r\\nHe might take a fancy to mine\\xe2\\x80\\x94heavens! look at that tomahawk!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about something\\r\\nthat completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that he must indeed\\r\\nbe a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he\\r\\nhad previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the pockets, and produced at\\r\\nlength a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly\\r\\nthe color of a three days\\' old Congo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at\\r\\nfirst I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in\\r\\nsome similar manner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it\\r\\nglistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing\\r\\nbut a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to\\r\\nthe empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little\\r\\nhunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the andirons. The chimney jambs and\\r\\nall the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a\\r\\nvery appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but ill at\\r\\nease meantime\\xe2\\x80\\x94to see what was next to follow. First he takes about a double\\r\\nhandful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places them carefully before\\r\\nthe idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from\\r\\nthe lamp, he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after\\r\\nmany hasty snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers\\r\\n(whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing\\r\\nout the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite\\r\\noffer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy\\r\\nsuch dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange antics\\r\\nwere accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed\\r\\nto be praying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other,\\r\\nduring which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner. At last\\r\\nextinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it\\r\\nagain in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a\\r\\ndead woodcock.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAll these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing him now\\r\\nexhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations, and jumping\\r\\ninto bed with me, I thought it was high time, now or never, before the light\\r\\nwas put out, to break the spell in which I had so long been bound.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one. Taking\\r\\nup his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an instant, and\\r\\nthen holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle, he puffed out great\\r\\nclouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light was extinguished, and this\\r\\nwild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out,\\r\\nI could not help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began\\r\\nfeeling me.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nStammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him against the\\r\\nwall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might be, to keep quiet,\\r\\nand let me get up and light the lamp again. But his guttural responses\\r\\nsatisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Who-e debel you?\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94he at last said\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.\"<br>\\r\\nAnd so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark.\\r\\n\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Landlord, for God\\'s sake, Peter Coffin!\" shouted<br>\\r\\nI. \"Landlord! Watch! Coffin! Angels! save me!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!\" again growled the\\r\\ncannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot\\r\\ntobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire. But thank\\r\\nheaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand, and\\r\\nleaping from the bed I ran up to him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be afraid now,\" said he, grinning again, \"Queequeg here wouldn\\'t harm a\\r\\nhair of your head.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Stop your grinning,\" shouted I, \"and why didn\\'t you tell me that that infernal\\r\\nharpooneer was a cannibal?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I thought ye know\\'d it;\\xe2\\x80\\x94didn\\'t I tell ye, he was a peddlin\\' heads around\\r\\ntown?\\xe2\\x80\\x94but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look here\\xe2\\x80\\x94you sabbee me,\\r\\nI sabbee\\xe2\\x80\\x94you this man sleepe you\\xe2\\x80\\x94you sabbee?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Me sabbee plenty\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and sitting up in\\r\\nbed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"You gettee in,\" he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and throwing the\\r\\nclothes to one side. He really did this in not only a civil but a really kind\\r\\nand charitable way. I stood looking at him a moment. For all his tattooings he\\r\\nwas on the whole a clean, comely looking cannibal. What\\'s all this fuss I have\\r\\nbeen making about, thought I to myself\\xe2\\x80\\x94the man\\'s a human being just as I am: he\\r\\nhas just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep\\r\\nwith a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Landlord,\" said I, \"tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or whatever\\r\\nyou call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will turn in with him.\\r\\nBut I don\\'t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me. It\\'s dangerous. Besides,\\r\\nI ain\\'t insured.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThis being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely motioned\\r\\nme to get into bed\\xe2\\x80\\x94rolling over to one side as much as to say\\xe2\\x80\\x94 I won\\'t touch a\\r\\nleg of ye.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Good night, landlord,\" said I, \"you may go.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI turned in, and never slept better in my life.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 4</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Counterpane\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nUpon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg\\'s arm thrown over me\\r\\nin the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost thought I had been\\r\\nhis wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of odd little parti-colored\\r\\nsquares and triangles; and this arm of his tattooed all over with an\\r\\ninterminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one\\r\\nprecise shade\\xe2\\x80\\x94 owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in\\r\\nsun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times\\xe2\\x80\\x94 this\\r\\nsame arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same\\r\\npatchwork quilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke,\\r\\nI could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues together; and\\r\\nit was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg\\r\\nwas hugging me.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMy sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a child, I\\r\\nwell remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me; whether it was a\\r\\nreality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The circumstance was this. I\\r\\nhad been cutting up some caper or other\\xe2\\x80\\x94 I think it was trying to crawl up the\\r\\nchimney, as I had seen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother\\r\\nwho, somehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed\\r\\nsupperless,\\xe2\\x80\\x94 my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me\\r\\noff to bed, though it was only two o\\'clock in the afternoon of the 21st June,\\r\\nthe longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But there was\\r\\nno help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the third floor,\\r\\nundressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time, and with a bitter\\r\\nsigh got between the sheets.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before I\\r\\ncould hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small of my back ached\\r\\nto think of it. And it was so light too; the sun shining in at the window, and\\r\\na great rattling of coaches in the streets, and the sound of gay voices all\\r\\nover the house. I felt worse and worse\\xe2\\x80\\x94 at last I got up, dressed, and softly\\r\\ngoing down in my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw\\r\\nmyself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favor to give me a good\\r\\nslippering for my misbehaviour: anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed\\r\\nsuch an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and most conscientious\\r\\nof stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For several hours I lay there\\r\\nbroad awake, feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done since, even from\\r\\nthe greatest subsequent misfortunes. At last I must have fallen into a troubled\\r\\nnightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it\\xe2\\x80\\x94half steeped in dreams\\xe2\\x80\\x94I opened\\r\\nmy eyes, and the before sunlit room was now wrapped in outer darkness.\\r\\nInstantly I felt a shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen,\\r\\nand nothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine. My\\r\\narm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or\\r\\nphantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side. For\\r\\nwhat seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most awful fears,\\r\\nnot daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it\\r\\none single inch, the horrid spell would be broken. I knew not how this\\r\\nconsciousness at last glided away from me; but waking in the morning, I\\r\\nshudderingly remembered it all, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I\\r\\nlost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very\\r\\nhour, I often puzzle myself with it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the supernatural\\r\\nhand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to those which I\\r\\nexperienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg\\'s pagan arm thrown round me. But\\r\\nat length all the past night\\'s events soberly recurred, one by one, in fixed\\r\\nreality, and then I lay only alive to the comical predicament. For though I\\r\\ntried to move his arm\\xe2\\x80\\x94 unlock his bridegroom clasp\\xe2\\x80\\x94yet, sleeping as he was, he\\r\\nstill hugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain. I now\\r\\nstrove to rouse him\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Queequeg!\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled\\r\\nover, my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a\\r\\nslight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping\\r\\nby the savage\\'s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A pretty pickle,\\r\\ntruly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a\\r\\ncannibal and a tomahawk! \"Queequeg!\\xe2\\x80\\x94in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!\"\\r\\nAt length, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant expostulations\\r\\nupon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort\\r\\nof style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his\\r\\narm, shook himself all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and\\r\\nsat up in bed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if\\r\\nhe did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\\r\\nconsciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him.\\r\\nMeanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings now, and bent\\r\\nupon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at last, his mind seemed\\r\\nmade up touching the character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were,\\r\\nreconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain signs and\\r\\nsounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress first and\\r\\nthen leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself.\\r\\nThinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture;\\r\\nbut, the truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you\\r\\nwill; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this particular\\r\\ncompliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much civility and\\r\\nconsideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness; staring at him from the\\r\\nbed, and watching all his toilette motions; for the time my curiosity getting\\r\\nthe better of my breeding. Nevertheless, a man like Queequeg you don\\'t see\\r\\nevery day, he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall one, by the\\r\\nby, and then\\xe2\\x80\\x94still minus his trowsers\\xe2\\x80\\x94 he hunted up his boots. What under the\\r\\nheavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next movement was to crush\\r\\nhimself\\xe2\\x80\\x94 boots in hand, and hat on\\xe2\\x80\\x94under the bed; when, from sundry violent\\r\\ngaspings and strainings, I inferred he was hard at work booting himself; though\\r\\nby no law of propriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private\\r\\nwhen putting on his boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the\\r\\ntransition state\\xe2\\x80\\x94 neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough\\r\\ncivilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manner. His\\r\\neducation was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not been a\\r\\nsmall degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled himself with\\r\\nboots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage, he never would have\\r\\ndreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At last, he emerged with his\\r\\nhat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began creaking and\\r\\nlimping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed to boots, his pair of\\r\\ndamp, wrinkled cowhide ones\\xe2\\x80\\x94 probably not made to order either\\xe2\\x80\\x94rather pinched\\r\\nand tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSeeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the street\\r\\nbeing very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room, and\\r\\nobserving more and more the indecorous figure that Queequeg made, staving about\\r\\nwith little else but his hat and boots on; I begged him as well as I could, to\\r\\naccelerate his toilet somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as\\r\\nsoon as possible. He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time\\r\\nin the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my\\r\\namazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest, arms,\\r\\nand hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on\\r\\nthe wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his\\r\\nface. I was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he\\r\\ntakes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden stock,\\r\\nunsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and striding up to the bit\\r\\nof mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of\\r\\nhis cheeks. Thinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers\\'s best cutlery with a\\r\\nvengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to know\\r\\nof what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the\\r\\nlong straight edges are always kept.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of the\\r\\nroom, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his harpoon\\r\\nlike a marshal\\'s baton.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 5</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBreakfast\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the grinning\\r\\nlandlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him, though he had been\\r\\nskylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHowever, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a good\\r\\nthing; the more\\'s the pity. So, if any one man, in his own proper person,\\r\\nafford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be backward, but let him\\r\\ncheerfully allow himself to spend and to be spent in that way. And the man that\\r\\nhas anything bountifully laughable about him, be sure there is more in that man\\r\\nthan you perhaps think for.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night\\r\\nprevious, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were nearly all\\r\\nwhalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and sea carpenters,\\r\\nand sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship keepers; a\\r\\nbrown and brawny company, with bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all\\r\\nwearing monkey jackets for morning gowns.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nYou could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This young\\r\\nfellow\\'s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and would seem to\\r\\nsmell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days landed from his Indian\\r\\nvoyage. That man next him looks a few shades lighter; you might say a touch of\\r\\nsatin wood is in him. In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn,\\r\\nbut slightly bleached withal; he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. But\\r\\nwho could show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various tints, seemed\\r\\nlike the Andes\\' western slope, to show forth in one array, contrasting\\r\\nclimates, zone by zone.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Grub, ho!\" now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we went to\\r\\nbreakfast.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease in\\r\\nmanner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though: Ledyard, the great\\r\\nNew England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch one; of all men, they\\r\\npossessed the least assurance in the parlor. But perhaps the mere crossing of\\r\\nSiberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or the taking a long solitary\\r\\nwalk on an empty stomach, in the negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of\\r\\npoor Mungo\\'s performances\\xe2\\x80\\x94 this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best\\r\\nmode of attaining a high social polish. Still, for the most part, that sort of\\r\\nthing is to be had anywhere.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThese reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we\\r\\nwere all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some good stories\\r\\nabout whaling; to my no small surprise nearly every man maintained a profound\\r\\nsilence. And not only that, but they looked embarrassed. Yes, here were a set\\r\\nof sea-dogs, many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great\\r\\nwhales on the high seas\\xe2\\x80\\x94entire strangers to them\\xe2\\x80\\x94 and duelled them dead without\\r\\nwinking; and yet, here they sat at a social breakfast table\\xe2\\x80\\x94all of the same\\r\\ncalling, all of kindred tastes\\xe2\\x80\\x94looking round as sheepishly at each other as\\r\\nthough they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green\\r\\nMountains. A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior whalemen!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut as for Queequeg\\xe2\\x80\\x94why, Queequeg sat there among them\\xe2\\x80\\x94 at the head of the\\r\\ntable, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I cannot say much\\r\\nfor his breeding. His greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his\\r\\nbringing his harpoon into breakfast with him, and using it there without\\r\\nceremony; reaching over the table with it, to the imminent jeopardy of many\\r\\nheads, and grappling the beefsteaks towards him. But that was certainly very\\r\\ncoolly done by him, and every one knows that in most people\\'s estimation, to do\\r\\nanything coolly is to do it genteelly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWe will not speak of all Queequeg\\'s peculiarities here; how he eschewed coffee\\r\\nand hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks, done rare.\\r\\nEnough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public\\r\\nroom, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was sitting there quietly digesting and\\r\\nsmoking with his inseparable hat on, when I sallied out for a stroll.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 6</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Street\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIf I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an\\r\\nindividual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized\\r\\ntown, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll\\r\\nthrough the streets of New Bedford.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will frequently offer\\r\\nto view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts. Even in Broadway\\r\\nand Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the\\r\\naffrighted ladies. Regent Street is not unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at\\r\\nBombay, in the Apollo Green, live Yankees have often scared the natives. But\\r\\nNew Bedford beats all Water Street and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunts\\r\\nyou see only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at\\r\\nstreet corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy\\r\\nflesh. It makes a stranger stare.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians, and\\r\\nBrighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft which\\r\\nunheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still more curious,\\r\\ncertainly more comical. There weekly arrive in this town scores of green\\r\\nVermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain and glory in the\\r\\nfishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows who have felled\\r\\nforests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale-lance. Many are as\\r\\ngreen as the Green Mountains whence they came. In some things you would think\\r\\nthem but a few hours old. Look there! that chap strutting round the corner. He\\r\\nwears a beaver hat and swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and a\\r\\nsheath-knife. Here comes another with a sou\\'-wester and a bombazine cloak.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNo town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one\\xe2\\x80\\x94I mean a downright\\r\\nbumpkin dandy\\xe2\\x80\\x94a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his two acres in\\r\\nbuckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a country dandy like\\r\\nthis takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation, and joins the\\r\\ngreat whale-fishery, you should see the comical things he does upon reaching\\r\\nthe seaport. In bespeaking his sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his\\r\\nwaistcoats; straps to his canvas trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will\\r\\nburst those straps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps,\\r\\nbuttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals, and\\r\\nbumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Still New Bedford is a queer place.\\r\\nHad it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would this day perhaps have\\r\\nbeen in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador. As it is, parts of her\\r\\nback country are enough to frighten one, they look so bony. The town itself is\\r\\nperhaps the dearest place to live in, in all New England. It is a land of oil,\\r\\ntrue enough: but not like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine. The streets\\r\\ndo not run with milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs.\\r\\nYet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like\\r\\nhouses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford. Whence came they?\\r\\nhow planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nGo and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion, and\\r\\nyour question will be answered. Yes; all these brave houses and flowery gardens\\r\\ncame from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. One and all, they were\\r\\nharpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea. Can Herr Alexander\\r\\nperform a feat like that?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their daughters,\\r\\nand portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece. You must go to New\\r\\nBedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say, they have reservoirs of oil\\r\\nin every house, and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti\\r\\ncandles.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples\\xe2\\x80\\x94 long avenues of\\r\\ngreen and gold. And in August, high in air, the beautiful and bountiful\\r\\nhorse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by their tapering upright\\r\\ncones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is art; which in many a district\\r\\nof New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren\\r\\nrefuse rocks thrown aside at creation\\'s final day.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. But roses\\r\\nonly bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial\\r\\nas sunlight in the seventh heavens. Elsewhere match that bloom of theirs, ye\\r\\ncannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk,\\r\\ntheir sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore, as though they were\\r\\ndrawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 7</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Chapel\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman\\'s Chapel, and few are the\\r\\nmoody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who fail to\\r\\nmake a Sunday visit to the spot. I am sure that I did not.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nReturning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this special\\r\\nerrand. The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving sleet and mist.\\r\\nWrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin, I fought my\\r\\nway against the stubborn storm. Entering, I found a small scattered\\r\\ncongregation of sailors, and sailors\\' wives and widows. A muffled silence\\r\\nreigned, only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm. Each silent\\r\\nworshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other, as if each silent\\r\\ngrief were insular and incommunicable. The chaplain had not yet arrived; and\\r\\nthere these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several\\r\\nmarble tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on either side the\\r\\npulpit. Three of them ran something like the following, but I do not pretend

WIDOW.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated myself near\\r\\nthe door, and turning sideways was surprised to see Queequeg near me. Affected\\r\\nby the solemnity of the scene, there was a wondering gaze of incredulous\\r\\ncuriosity in his countenance. This savage was the only person present who\\r\\nseemed to notice my entrance; because he was the only one who could not read,\\r\\nand, therefore, was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall. Whether\\r\\nany of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among\\r\\nthe congregation, I knew not; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the\\r\\nfishery, and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not\\r\\nthe trappings of some unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here before me\\r\\nwere assembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak\\r\\ntablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing among\\r\\nflowers can say\\xe2\\x80\\x94here, here lies my beloved; ye know not the desolation that\\r\\nbroods in bosoms like these. What bitter blanks in those black-bordered marbles\\r\\nwhich cover no ashes! What despair in those immovable inscriptions! What deadly\\r\\nvoids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith,\\r\\nand refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a\\r\\ngrave. As well might those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included; why it is\\r\\nthat a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no tales, though\\r\\ncontaining more secrets than the Goodwin Sands! how it is that to his name who\\r\\nyesterday departed for the other world, we prefix so significant and infidel a\\r\\nword, and yet do not thus entitle him, if he but embarks for the remotest\\r\\nIndies of this living earth; why the Life Insurance Companies pay\\r\\ndeath-forfeitures upon immortals; in what eternal, unstirring paralysis, and\\r\\ndeadly, hopeless trance, yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round centuries\\r\\nago; how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we\\r\\nnevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the living so\\r\\nstrive to hush all the dead; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb\\r\\nwill terrify a whole city. All these things are not without their meanings.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these dead\\r\\ndoubts she gathers her most vital hope.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a Nantucket\\r\\nvoyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky light of that\\r\\ndarkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me.\\r\\nYes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine. But somehow I grew merry again.\\r\\nDelightful inducements to embark, fine chance for promotion, it seems\\xe2\\x80\\x94aye, a\\r\\nstove boat will make me an immortal by brevet. Yes, there is death in this\\r\\nbusiness of whaling\\xe2\\x80\\x94a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into\\r\\nEternity. But what then? Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life\\r\\nand Death. Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true\\r\\nsubstance. Methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too much like\\r\\noysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking that thick water the\\r\\nthinnest of air. Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being. In fact\\r\\ntake my body who will, take it I say, it is not me. And therefore three cheers\\r\\nfor Nantucket; and come a stove boat and stove body when they will, for stave\\r\\nmy soul, Jove himself cannot.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 8</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Pulpit\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness\\r\\nentered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon admitting him, a\\r\\nquick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation, sufficiently attested\\r\\nthat this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple,\\r\\nso called by the whalemen, among whom he was a very great favorite. He had been\\r\\na sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had dedicated\\r\\nhis life to the ministry. At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the\\r\\nhardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging\\r\\ninto a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles,\\r\\nthere shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the spring verdure\\r\\npeeping forth even beneath February\\'s snow. No one having previously heard his\\r\\nhistory, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost\\r\\ninterest, because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about\\r\\nhim, imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led. When he entered I\\r\\nobserved that he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his\\r\\ncarriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great\\r\\npilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of\\r\\nthe water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one\\r\\nremoved, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when, arrayed in\\r\\na decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLike most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a regular\\r\\nstairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor, seriously\\r\\ncontract the already small area of the chapel, the architect, it seemed, had\\r\\nacted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the pulpit without a stairs,\\r\\nsubstituting a perpendicular side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship\\r\\nfrom a boat at sea. The wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with\\r\\na handsome pair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself\\r\\nnicely headed, and stained with a mahogany color, the whole contrivance,\\r\\nconsidering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad taste.\\r\\nHalting for an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both hands grasping\\r\\nthe ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and\\r\\nthen with a truly sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand,\\r\\nmounted the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case with\\r\\nswinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of wood, so\\r\\nthat at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of the pulpit, it had\\r\\nnot escaped me that however convenient for a ship, these joints in the present\\r\\ninstance seemed unnecessary. For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after\\r\\ngaining the height, slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit,\\r\\ndeliberately drag up the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited\\r\\nwithin, leaving him impregnable in his little Quebec.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this. Father\\r\\nMapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity, that I could\\r\\nnot suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage. No,\\r\\nthought I, there must be some sober reason for this thing; furthermore, it must\\r\\nsymbolize something unseen. Can it be, then, that by that act of physical\\r\\nisolation, he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward\\r\\nworldly ties and connexions? Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the\\r\\nword, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a self-containing\\r\\nstronghold\\xe2\\x80\\x94a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial well of water within the\\r\\nwalls.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place, borrowed\\r\\nfrom the chaplain\\'s former sea-farings. Between the marble cenotaphs on either\\r\\nhand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large\\r\\npainting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee\\r\\ncoast of black rocks and snowy breakers. But high above the flying scud and\\r\\ndark-rolling clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed\\r\\nforth an angel\\'s face; and this bright face shed a distant spot of radiance\\r\\nupon the ship\\'s tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into\\r\\nthe Victory\\'s plank where Nelson fell. \"Ah, noble ship,\" the angel seemed to\\r\\nsay, \"beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun\\r\\nis breaking through; the clouds are rolling off\\xe2\\x80\\x94 serenest azure is at hand.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that had\\r\\nachieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in the likeness of\\r\\na ship\\'s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll\\r\\nwork, fashioned after a ship\\'s fiddle-headed beak.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhat could be more full of meaning?\\xe2\\x80\\x94for the pulpit is ever this earth\\'s\\r\\nforemost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the world. From\\r\\nthence it is the storm of God\\'s quick wrath is first descried, and the bow must\\r\\nbear the earliest brunt. From thence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is\\r\\nfirst invoked for favorable winds.

A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of\\r\\nthe Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon the proper page, said:\\r\\n\"Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the first chapter of Jonah\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\'And\\r\\nGod had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.\\'\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters\\xe2\\x80\\x94 four yarns\\xe2\\x80\\x94is one of the\\r\\nsmallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet what depths of the\\r\\nsoul does Jonah\\'s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant lesson to us is this\\r\\nprophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in the fish\\'s belly! How\\r\\nbillow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the floods surging over us, we\\r\\nsound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters; sea-weed and all the slime of\\r\\nthe sea is about us! But what is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches?\\r\\nShipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a\\r\\nlesson to me as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us\\r\\nall, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly awakened\\r\\nfears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance\\r\\nand joy of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai\\r\\nwas in his wilful disobedience of the command of God\\xe2\\x80\\x94 never mind now what that\\r\\ncommand was, or how conveyed\\xe2\\x80\\x94 which he found a hard command. But all the things\\r\\nthat God would have us do are hard for us to do\\xe2\\x80\\x94remember that\\xe2\\x80\\x94 and hence, he\\r\\noftener commands us than endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we must\\r\\ndisobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness\\r\\nof obeying God consists.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at God, by\\r\\nseeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men, will carry him\\r\\ninto countries where God does not reign but only the Captains of this earth. He\\r\\nskulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks a ship that\\'s bound for Tarshish.\\r\\nThere lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here. By all accounts\\r\\nTarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz. That\\'s the\\r\\nopinion of learned men. And where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as\\r\\nfar by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient\\r\\ndays, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern\\r\\nJaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean, the\\r\\nSyrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from\\r\\nthat, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar. See ye not then, shipmates, that\\r\\nJonah sought to flee worldwide from God? Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible\\r\\nand worthy of all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his\\r\\nGod; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the\\r\\nseas. So disordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen\\r\\nin those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had been\\r\\narrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he\\'s a fugitive! no baggage, not a\\r\\nhat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,\\xe2\\x80\\x94no friends accompany him to the wharf with\\r\\ntheir adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he finds the Tarshish ship\\r\\nreceiving the last items of her cargo; and as he steps on board to see its\\r\\nCaptain in the cabin, all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in\\r\\nthe goods, to mark the stranger\\'s evil eye. Jonah sees this; but in vain he\\r\\ntries to look all ease and confidence; in vain essays his wretched smile.\\r\\nStrong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent. In\\r\\ntheir gamesome but still serious way, one whispers to the other\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Jack, he\\'s\\r\\nrobbed a widow;\" or, \"Joe, do you mark him; he\\'s a bigamist;\" or, \"Harry lad, I\\r\\nguess he\\'s the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike, one of the\\r\\nmissing murderers from Sodom.\" Another runs to read the bill that\\'s stuck\\r\\nagainst the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored, offering five\\r\\nhundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide, and containing a\\r\\ndescription of his person. He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while\\r\\nall his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their\\r\\nhands upon him. Frighted Jonah trembles. and summoning all his boldness to his\\r\\nface, only looks so much the more a coward. He will not confess himself\\r\\nsuspected; but that itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of it; and\\r\\nwhen the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let him\\r\\npass, and he descends into the cabin.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Who\\'s there?\\' cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making out his\\r\\npapers for the Customs\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\'Who\\'s there?\\' Oh! how that harmless question mangles\\r\\nJonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again. But he rallies. \\'I seek a\\r\\npassage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon sail ye, sir?\\' Thus far the busy\\r\\nCaptain had not looked up to Jonah, though the man now stands before him; but\\r\\nno sooner does he hear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance.\\r\\n\\'We sail with the next coming tide,\\' at last he slowly answered, still intently\\r\\neyeing him. \\'No sooner, sir?\\'\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\'Soon enough for any honest man that goes a\\r\\npassenger.\\' Ha! Jonah, that\\'s another stab. But he swiftly calls away the\\r\\nCaptain from that scent. \\'I\\'ll sail with ye,\\'\\xe2\\x80\\x94he says,\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\'the passage money how\\r\\nmuch is that?\\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\'ll pay now.\\' For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if\\r\\nit were a thing not to be overlooked in this history, \\'that he paid the fare\\r\\nthereof\\' ere the craft did sail. And taken with the context, this is full of\\r\\nmeaning.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Now Jonah\\'s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects crime in\\r\\nany, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In this world,\\r\\nshipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely and without a passport;\\r\\nwhereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers. So Jonah\\'s Captain\\r\\nprepares to test the length of Jonah\\'s purse, ere he judge him openly. He\\r\\ncharges him thrice the usual sum; and it\\'s assented to. Then the Captain knows\\r\\nthat Jonah is a fugitive; but at the same time resolves to help a flight that\\r\\npaves its rear with gold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent\\r\\nsuspicions still molest the Captain. He rings every coin to find a counterfeit.\\r\\nNot a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his passage.\\r\\n\\'Point out my state-room, Sir,\\' says Jonah now, \\'I\\'m travel-weary; I need\\r\\nsleep.\" \"Thou look\\'st like it,\\' says the Captain, \\'there\\'s thy room.\\' Jonah\\r\\nenters, and would lock the door, but the lock contains no key. Hearing him\\r\\nfoolishly fumbling there, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters\\r\\nsomething about the doors of convicts\\' cells being never allowed to be locked\\r\\nwithin. All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth,\\r\\nand finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air\\r\\nis close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too, beneath\\r\\nthe ship\\'s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling\\r\\nhour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels\\' wards.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in\\r\\nJonah\\'s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of\\r\\nthe last bales received, the lamp, flame and all, though in slight motion,\\r\\nstill maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room; though, in\\r\\ntruth, infallibly straight itself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels\\r\\namong which it hung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth\\r\\nhis tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful fugitive\\r\\nfinds no refuge for his restless glance. But that contradiction in the lamp\\r\\nmore and more appals him. The floor, the ceiling, and the side, are all awry.\\r\\n\\'Oh! so my conscience hangs in me!\\' he groans, \"straight upward, so it burns;\\r\\nbut the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still reeling,\\r\\nbut with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the Roman race-horse\\r\\nbut so much the more strike his steel tags into him; as one who in that\\r\\nmiserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish, praying God for\\r\\nannihilation until the fit be passed; and at last amid the whirl of woe he\\r\\nfeels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the man who bleeds to death, for\\r\\nconscience is the wound, and there\\'s naught to staunch it; so, after sore\\r\\nwrestling in his berth, Jonah\\'s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning\\r\\ndown to sleep.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and from the\\r\\ndeserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening, glides to sea.\\r\\nThat ship, my friends, was the first of recorded smugglers! the contraband was\\r\\nJonah. But the sea rebels; he will not bear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm\\r\\ncomes on, the ship is like to break. But now when the boatswain calls all hands\\r\\nto lighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard; when the\\r\\nwind is shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with\\r\\ntrampling feet right over Jonah\\'s head; in all this raging tumult, Jonah sleeps\\r\\nhis hideous sleep. He sees no black sky and raging sea, feels not the reeling\\r\\ntimbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale,\\r\\nwhich even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him. Aye, shipmates,\\r\\nJonah was gone down into the sides of the ship\\xe2\\x80\\x94 a berth in the cabin as I have\\r\\ntaken it, and was fast asleep. But the frightened master comes to him, and\\r\\nshrieks in his dead ear, \\'What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!\\' Startled from\\r\\nhis lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to\\r\\nthe deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But at that moment he is\\r\\nsprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks. Wave after wave thus\\r\\nleaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft, till\\r\\nthe mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat. And ever, as the white\\r\\nmoon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness\\r\\noverhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon\\r\\nbeat downward again towards the tormented deep.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his cringing\\r\\nattitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The sailors mark him;\\r\\nmore and more certain grow their suspicions of him, and at last, fully to test\\r\\nthe truth, by referring the whole matter to high Heaven, they all-outward to\\r\\ncasting lots, to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them. The lot\\r\\nis Jonah\\'s; that discovered, then how furiously they mob him with their\\r\\nquestions. \\'What is thine occupation? Whence comest thou? Thy country? What\\r\\npeople? But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah. The eager\\r\\nmariners but ask him who he is, and where from; whereas, they not only receive\\r\\nan answer to those questions, but likewise another answer to a question not put\\r\\nby them, but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand of\\r\\nGod that is upon him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'I am a Hebrew,\\' he cries\\xe2\\x80\\x94and then\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\'I fear the Lord the God of Heaven who hath\\r\\nmade the sea and the dry land!\\' Fear him, O Jonah? Aye, well mightest thou fear\\r\\nthe Lord God then! Straightway, he now goes on to make a full confession;\\r\\nwhereupon the mariners became more and more appalled, but still are pitiful.\\r\\nFor when Jonah, not yet supplicating God for mercy, since he but too well knew\\r\\nthe darkness of his deserts,\\xe2\\x80\\x94 when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him\\r\\nand cast him forth into the sea, for he knew that for his sake this great\\r\\ntempest was upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means\\r\\nto save the ship. But all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder; then, with\\r\\none hand raised invokingly to God, with the other they not unreluctantly lay\\r\\nhold of Jonah.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea; when\\r\\ninstantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea is still, as\\r\\nJonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water behind. He goes down\\r\\nin the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the\\r\\nmoment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale\\r\\nshoots-to all his ivory teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison. Then\\r\\nJonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish\\'s belly. But observe his prayer, and\\r\\nso many white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed unto learn a weighty\\r\\nlesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for direct\\r\\ndeliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is just. He leaves all his\\r\\ndeliverance to God, contenting himself with this, that spite of all his pains\\r\\nand pangs, he will still look towards His holy temple. And here, shipmates, is\\r\\ntrue and faithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for\\r\\npunishment. And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in the\\r\\neventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I do not\\r\\nplace Jonah before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you\\r\\nas a model for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it\\r\\nlike Jonah.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhile he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking, slanting storm\\r\\nwithout seemed to add new power to the preacher, who, when describing Jonah\\'s\\r\\nsea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself. His deep chest heaved as with a\\r\\nground-swell; his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work; and the\\r\\nthunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from\\r\\nhis eye, made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was\\r\\nstrange to them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the leaves of the\\r\\nBook once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with closed eyes, for the\\r\\nmoment, seemed communing with God and himself.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly, with an\\r\\naspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these words:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press upon me. I\\r\\nhave read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that Jonah teaches to\\r\\nall sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to me, for I am a greater\\r\\nsinner than ye. And now how gladly would I come down from this mast-head and\\r\\nsit on the hatches there where you sit, and listen as you listen, while some\\r\\none of you reads me that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to me,\\r\\nas a pilot of the living God. How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker\\r\\nof true things and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the\\r\\nears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should raise,\\r\\nfled from his mission, and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking ship\\r\\nat Joppa. But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never reached. As we have seen,\\r\\nGod came upon him in the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom,\\r\\nand with swift slantings tore him along \\'into the midst of the seas,\\' where the\\r\\neddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down, and \\'the weeds were\\r\\nwrapped about his head,\\' and all the watery world of woe bowled over him. Yet\\r\\neven then beyond the reach of any plummet\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\'out of the belly of hell\\'\\xe2\\x80\\x94when the\\r\\nwhale grounded upon the ocean\\'s utmost bones, even then, God heard the\\r\\nengulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. Then God spake unto the fish; and\\r\\nfrom the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale came breeching up\\r\\ntowards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and earth; and\\r\\n\\'vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;\\' when the word of the Lord came a second\\r\\ntime; and Jonah, bruised and beaten\\xe2\\x80\\x94his ears, like two sea-shells, still\\r\\nmultitudinously murmuring of the ocean\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Jonah did the Almighty\\'s bidding. And\\r\\nwhat was that, shipmates? To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood! That\\r\\nwas it!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of the\\r\\nliving God who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms from Gospel duty!\\r\\nWoe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed them into\\r\\na gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal! Woe to him whose\\r\\ngood name is more to him than goodness! Woe to him who, in this world, courts\\r\\nnot dishonor! Woe to him who would not be true, even though to be false were\\r\\nsalvation! Yea, woe to him who as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching\\r\\nto others is himself a castaway!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe drooped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his face to\\r\\nthem again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with a heavenly\\r\\nenthusiasm,\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"But oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of every woe, there is a\\r\\nsure delight; and higher the top of that delight, than the bottom of the woe is\\r\\ndeep. Is not the main-truck higher than the kelson is low? Delight is to him\\xe2\\x80\\x94a\\r\\nfar, far upward, and inward delight\\xe2\\x80\\x94 who against the proud gods and commodores\\r\\nof this earth, ever stands forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him\\r\\nwhose strong arms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world\\r\\nhas gone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the\\r\\ntruth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under\\r\\nthe robes of Senators and Judges. Delight,\\xe2\\x80\\x94top-gallant delight is to him, who\\r\\nacknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is only a patriot to\\r\\nheaven. Delight is to him, whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the\\r\\nboisterous mob can never shake from this sure Keel of the Ages.

He was\\r\\nsitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the stove hearth, and in\\r\\none hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his;\\r\\npeering hard into its face, and with a jack-knife gently whittling away at its\\r\\nnose, meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going to the\\r\\ntable, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap began counting the\\r\\npages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth page\\xe2\\x80\\x94 as I fancied\\xe2\\x80\\x94stopping\\r\\nfor a moment, looking vacantly around him, and giving utterance to a long-drawn\\r\\ngurgling whistle of astonishment. He would then begin again at the next fifty;\\r\\nseeming to commence at number one each time, as though he could not count more\\r\\nthan fifty, and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found\\r\\ntogether, that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWith much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and hideously\\r\\nmarred about the face\\xe2\\x80\\x94at least to my taste\\xe2\\x80\\x94 his countenance yet had a something\\r\\nin it which was by no means disagreeable. You cannot hide the soul. Through all\\r\\nhis unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart;\\r\\nand in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a\\r\\nspirit that would dare a thousand devils. And besides all this, there was a\\r\\ncertain lofty bearing about the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not\\r\\naltogether maim. He looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a\\r\\ncreditor. Whether it was, too, that his head being shaved, his forehead was\\r\\ndrawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it\\r\\notherwise would, this I will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head\\r\\nwas phrenologically an excellent one. It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded\\r\\nme of General Washington\\'s head, as seen in the popular busts of him. It had\\r\\nthe same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows, which\\r\\nwere likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly wooded on\\r\\ntop. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be looking\\r\\nout at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my presence, never troubled\\r\\nhimself with so much as a single glance; but appeared wholly occupied with\\r\\ncounting the pages of the marvellous book. Considering how sociably we had been\\r\\nsleeping together the night previous, and especially considering the\\r\\naffectionate arm I had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I\\r\\nthought this indifference of his very strange. But savages are strange beings;\\r\\nat times you do not know exactly how to take them. At first they are overawing;\\r\\ntheir calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems as Socratic wisdom. I had\\r\\nnoticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little, with the\\r\\nother seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever; appeared to have no\\r\\ndesire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances. All this struck me as mighty\\r\\nsingular; yet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost sublime in it.\\r\\nHere was a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the way of Cape Horn,\\r\\nthat is\\xe2\\x80\\x94 which was the only way he could get there\\xe2\\x80\\x94thrown among people as\\r\\nstrange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed\\r\\nentirely at his ease; preserving the utmost serenity; content with his own\\r\\ncompanionship; always equal to himself. Surely this was a touch of fine\\r\\nphilosophy; though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that.\\r\\nBut, perhaps, to be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of so\\r\\nliving or so striving. So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself\\r\\nout for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, he must\\r\\nhave \"broken his digester.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that mild\\r\\nstage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then only glows to\\r\\nbe looked at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements,\\r\\nand peering in upon us silent, solitary twain; the storm booming without in\\r\\nsolemn swells; I began to be sensible of strange feelings. I felt a melting in\\r\\nme. No more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the\\r\\nwolfish world. This soothing savage had redeemed it. There he sat, his very\\r\\nindifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies\\r\\nand bland deceits. Wild he was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to\\r\\nfeel myself mysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things that would\\r\\nhave repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus drew me. I\\'ll\\r\\ntry a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness has proved but hollow\\r\\ncourtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some friendly signs and hints,\\r\\ndoing my best to talk with him meanwhile. At first he little noticed these\\r\\nadvances; but presently, upon my referring to his last night\\'s hospitalities,\\r\\nhe made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows. I told him yes;\\r\\nwhereat I thought he looked pleased, perhaps a little complimented.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWe then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to him the\\r\\npurpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it.\\r\\nThus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we went to jabbering the best\\r\\nwe could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town. Soon I\\r\\nproposed a social smoke; and, producing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly\\r\\noffered me a puff. And then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his,\\r\\nand keeping it regularly passing between us.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIf there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan\\'s breast,\\r\\nthis pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and left us cronies. He\\r\\nseemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as I to him; and when\\r\\nour smoke was over, he pressed his forehead against mine, clasped me round the\\r\\nwaist, and said that henceforth we were married; meaning, in his country\\'s\\r\\nphrase, that we were bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should\\r\\nbe. In a countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too\\r\\npremature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple savage those old\\r\\nrules would not apply.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAfter supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room together.\\r\\nHe made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his enormous tobacco\\r\\nwallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some thirty dollars in silver;\\r\\nthen spreading them on the table, and mechanically dividing them into two equal\\r\\nportions, pushed one of them towards me, and said it was mine. I was going to\\r\\nremonstrate; but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers\\' pockets. I\\r\\nlet them stay. He then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and\\r\\nremoved the paper firebrand. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed\\r\\nanxious for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I deliberated\\r\\na moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or otherwise.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible\\r\\nPresbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in\\r\\nworshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do you suppose\\r\\nnow, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and earth\\xe2\\x80\\x94pagans and all\\r\\nincluded\\xe2\\x80\\x94can possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood?\\r\\nImpossible! But what is worship?\\xe2\\x80\\x94 to do the will of God? that is worship. And\\r\\nwhat is the will of God?\\xe2\\x80\\x94 to do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow\\r\\nman to do to me\\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is the will of God. Now, Queequeg is my fellow man. And\\r\\nwhat do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me? Why, unite with me in my\\r\\nparticular Presbyterian form of worship. Consequently, I must then unite with\\r\\nhim in his; ergo, I must turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped prop\\r\\nup the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg; salamed\\r\\nbefore him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that done, we undressed and\\r\\nwent to bed, at peace with our own consciences and all the world. But we did\\r\\nnot go to sleep without some little chat.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHow it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential\\r\\ndisclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the very bottom\\r\\nof their souls to each other; and some old couples often lie and chat over old\\r\\ntimes till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our hearts\\' honeymoon, lay I and\\r\\nQueequeg\\xe2\\x80\\x94 a cosy, loving pair.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 11</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNightgown\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWe had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and Queequeg\\r\\nnow and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine, and\\r\\nthen drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free and easy were we; when,\\r\\nat last, by reason of our confabulations, what little nappishness remained in\\r\\nus altogether departed, and we felt like getting up again, though day-break was\\r\\nyet some way down the future.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nYes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position began to\\r\\ngrow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up; the\\r\\nclothes well tucked around us, leaning against the headboard with our four\\r\\nknees drawn up close together, and our two noses bending over them, as if our\\r\\nknee-pans were warming-pans. We felt very nice and snug, the more so since it\\r\\nwas so chilly out of doors; indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there\\r\\nwas no fire in the room. The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily\\r\\nwarmth, some small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this\\r\\nworld that is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If\\r\\nyou flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been so a long\\r\\ntime, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. But if, like Queequeg\\r\\nand me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly\\r\\nchilled, why then, indeed, in the general consciousness you feel most\\r\\ndelightfully and unmistakably warm. For this reason a sleeping apartment should\\r\\nnever be furnished with a fire, which is one of the luxurious discomforts of\\r\\nthe rich. For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but\\r\\nthe blankets between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then\\r\\nthere you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWe had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at once I\\r\\nthought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether by day or by\\r\\nnight, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always keeping my eyes\\r\\nshut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed. Because no\\r\\nman can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed; as if,\\r\\ndarkness were indeed the proper element of our essences, though light be more\\r\\ncongenial to our clayey part. Upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my\\r\\nown pleasant and self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom\\r\\nof the unilluminated twelve-o\\'clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable\\r\\nrevulsion. Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it\\r\\nwere best to strike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he\\r\\nfelt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk. Be it said,\\r\\nthat though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the\\r\\nnight before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once\\r\\ncomes to bend them. For now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg\\r\\nsmoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene\\r\\nhousehold joy then. I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord\\'s policy\\r\\nof insurance. I was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of\\r\\nsharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend. With our shaggy jackets drawn\\r\\nabout our shoulders, we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other, till\\r\\nslowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the\\r\\nflame of the new-lit lamp.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far\\r\\ndistant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island; and, eager\\r\\nto hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He gladly complied.\\r\\nThough at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his words, yet\\r\\nsubsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar with his broken\\r\\nphraseology, now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in\\r\\nthe mere skeleton I give.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 12</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBiographical\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nQueequeg was a native of Kokovoko, an island far away to the West and South. It\\r\\nis not down on any map; true places never are.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass\\r\\nclout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green sapling; even\\r\\nthen, in Queequeg\\'s ambitious soul, lurked a strong desire to see something\\r\\nmore of Christendom than a specimen whaler or two. His father was a High Chief,\\r\\na King; his uncle a High Priest; and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who\\r\\nwere the wives of unconquerable warriors. There was excellent blood in his\\r\\nveins\\xe2\\x80\\x94royal stuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he\\r\\nnourished in his untutored youth.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA Sag Harbor ship visited his father\\'s bay, and Queequeg sought a passage to\\r\\nChristian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of seamen, spurned\\r\\nhis suit; and not all the King his father\\'s influence could prevail. But\\r\\nQueequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled off to a distant strait,\\r\\nwhich he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island. On one\\r\\nside was a coral reef; on the other a low tongue of land, covered with mangrove\\r\\nthickets that grew out into the water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among\\r\\nthese thickets, with its prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in\\r\\nhand; and when the ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her\\r\\nside; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed\\r\\nup the chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a\\r\\nring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a cutlass over\\r\\nhis naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and Queequeg budged not.\\r\\nStruck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his wild desire to visit\\r\\nChristendom, the captain at last relented, and told him he might make himself\\r\\nat home. But this fine young savage\\xe2\\x80\\x94 this sea Prince of Wales, never saw the\\r\\nCaptain\\'s cabin. They put him down among the sailors, and made a whaleman of\\r\\nhim. But like Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities,\\r\\nQueequeg disdained no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the\\r\\npower of enlightening his untutored countrymen. For at bottom\\xe2\\x80\\x94so he told me\\xe2\\x80\\x94he\\r\\nwas actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians, the arts\\r\\nwhereby to make his people still happier than they were; and more than that,\\r\\nstill better than they were. But, alas! the practices of whalemen soon\\r\\nconvinced him that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked;\\r\\ninfinitely more so, than all his father\\'s heathens. Arrived at last in old Sag\\r\\nHarbor; and seeing what the sailors did there; and then going on to Nantucket,\\r\\nand seeing how they spent their wages in that place also, poor Queequeg gave it\\r\\nup for lost. Thought he, it\\'s a wicked world in all meridians; I\\'ll die a\\r\\npagan.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians, wore\\r\\ntheir clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. Hence the queer ways about\\r\\nhim, though now some time from home.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy hints I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having a\\r\\ncoronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he being very\\r\\nold and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not yet; and added that he\\r\\nwas fearful Christianity, or rather Christians, had unfitted him for ascending\\r\\nthe pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan Kings before him. But by and by,\\r\\nhe said, he would return,\\xe2\\x80\\x94as soon as he felt himself baptized again. For the\\r\\nnonce, however, he proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four\\r\\noceans. They had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of\\r\\na sceptre now.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future movements.\\r\\nHe answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon this, I told him\\r\\nthat whaling was my own design, and informed him of my intention to sail out of\\r\\nNantucket, as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to\\r\\nembark from. He at once resolved to accompany me to that island, ship aboard\\r\\nthe same vessel, get into the same watch, the same boat, the same mess with me,\\r\\nin short to share my every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the\\r\\nPotluck of both worlds. To all this I joyously assented; for besides the\\r\\naffection I now felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as\\r\\nsuch, could not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly\\r\\nignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as\\r\\nknown to merchant seamen.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHis story being ended with his pipe\\'s last dying puff, Queequeg embraced me,\\r\\npressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the light, we rolled over\\r\\nfrom each other, this way and that, and very soon were sleeping.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 13</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWheelbarrow\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNext morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber, for a\\r\\nblock, I settled my own and comrade\\'s bill; using, however, my comrade\\'s money.\\r\\nThe grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed amazingly tickled at the\\r\\nsudden friendship which had sprung up between me and Queequeg\\xe2\\x80\\x94 especially as\\r\\nPeter Coffin\\'s cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed\\r\\nme concerning the very person whom I now companied with.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWe borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own poor\\r\\ncarpet-bag, and Queequeg\\'s canvas sack and hammock, away we went down to \"the\\r\\nMoss,\" the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf. As we were\\r\\ngoing along the people stared; not at Queequeg so much\\xe2\\x80\\x94 for they were used to\\r\\nseeing cannibals like him in their streets,\\xe2\\x80\\x94 but at seeing him and me upon such\\r\\nconfidential terms. But we heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by\\r\\nturns, and Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon\\r\\nbarbs. I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and\\r\\nwhether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in\\r\\nsubstance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet he had a\\r\\nparticular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well\\r\\ntried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales.\\r\\nIn short, like many inland reapers and mowers, who go into the farmer\\'s meadows\\r\\narmed with their own scythes\\xe2\\x80\\x94though in no wise obliged to furnish them\\xe2\\x80\\x94 even\\r\\nso, Queequeg, for his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about the\\r\\nfirst wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The owners of his\\r\\nship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his heavy chest to his\\r\\nboarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the thing\\xe2\\x80\\x94though in truth he was\\r\\nentirely so, concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow\\xe2\\x80\\x94Queequeg\\r\\nputs his chest upon it; lashes it fast; and then shoulders the barrow and\\r\\nmarches up the wharf. \"Why,\" said I, \"Queequeg, you might have known better\\r\\nthan that, one would think. Didn\\'t the people laugh?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nUpon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of Rokovoko, it\\r\\nseems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts\\r\\ninto a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and this punchbowl always forms\\r\\nthe great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held. Now a\\r\\ncertain grand merchant ship once touched at Rokovoko, and its commander\\xe2\\x80\\x94from\\r\\nall accounts, a very stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\nthis commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg\\'s sister, a pretty\\r\\nyoung princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding guests were\\r\\nassembled at the bride\\'s bamboo cottage, this Captain marches in, and being\\r\\nassigned the post of honor, placed himself over against the punchbowl, and\\r\\nbetween the High Priest and his majesty the King, Queequeg\\'s father. Grace\\r\\nbeing said,\\xe2\\x80\\x94for those people have their grace as well as we\\xe2\\x80\\x94 though Queequeg\\r\\ntold me that unlike us, who at such times look downwards to our platters, they,\\r\\non the contrary, copying the ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all\\r\\nfeasts\\xe2\\x80\\x94Grace, I say, being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the\\r\\nimmemorial ceremony of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and\\r\\nconsecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates.\\r\\nSeeing himself placed next the Priest, and noting the ceremony, and thinking\\r\\nhimself\\xe2\\x80\\x94being Captain of a ship\\xe2\\x80\\x94as having plain precedence over a mere island\\r\\nKing, especially in the King\\'s own house\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the Captain coolly proceeds to wash\\r\\nhis hands in the punch bowl;\\xe2\\x80\\x94 taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass.\\r\\n\"Now,\" said Queequeg, \"what you tink now?\\xe2\\x80\\x94Didn\\'t our people laugh?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the schooner.\\r\\nHoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one side, New Bedford rose\\r\\nin terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees all glittering in the clear,\\r\\ncold air. Huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her\\r\\nwharves, and side by side the world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely\\r\\nmoored at last; while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with\\r\\nblended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new\\r\\ncruises were on the start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only\\r\\nbegins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on, for ever\\r\\nand for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all earthly\\r\\neffort.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nGaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little Moss\\r\\ntossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his snortings. How I\\r\\nsnuffed that Tartar air!\\xe2\\x80\\x94how I spurned that turnpike earth!\\xe2\\x80\\x94 that common\\r\\nhighway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs; and turned\\r\\nme to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me. His dusky\\r\\nnostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed teeth. On, on we flew,\\r\\nand our offing gained, the Moss did homage to the blast; ducked and dived her\\r\\nbows as a slave before the Sultan. Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every\\r\\nropeyarn tingling like a wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in\\r\\nland tornadoes. So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the\\r\\nplunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of\\r\\nthe passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow beings\\r\\nshould be so companionable; as though a white man were anything more dignified\\r\\nthan a whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who,\\r\\nby their intense greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all\\r\\nverdure. Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his\\r\\nback. I thought the bumpkin\\'s hour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the\\r\\nbrawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and\\r\\nstrength, sent him high up bodily into the air; then slightly tapping his stern\\r\\nin mid-somerset, the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while\\r\\nQueequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to\\r\\nme for a puff.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Capting! Capting! yelled the bumpkin, running toward that officer;<br>\\r\\n\"Capting, Capting, here\\'s the devil.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Hallo, you sir,\" cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking up to\\r\\nQueequeg, \"what in thunder do you mean by that? Don\\'t you know you might have\\r\\nkilled that chap?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What him say?\" said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"He say,\" said I, \"that you came near kill-e that man there,\" pointing to the\\r\\nstill shivering greenhorn.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Kill-e,\" cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly\\r\\nexpression of disdain, \"ah! him bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e so\\r\\nsmall-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Look you,\" roared the Captain, \"I\\'ll kill-e you, you cannibal, if you try any\\r\\nmore of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to mind his\\r\\nown eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted the weather-sheet,\\r\\nand the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side, completely sweeping\\r\\nthe entire after part of the deck. The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so\\r\\nroughly, was swept overboard; all hands were in a panic; and to attempt\\r\\nsnatching at the boom to stay it, seemed madness. It flew from right to left,\\r\\nand back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on\\r\\nthe point of snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed\\r\\ncapable of being done; those on deck rushed toward the bows, and stood eyeing\\r\\nthe boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the midst of\\r\\nthis consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under\\r\\nthe path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks,\\r\\nand then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as it swept\\r\\nover his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was\\r\\nsafe. The schooner was run into the wind, and while the hands were clearing\\r\\naway the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from the side with\\r\\na long living arc of a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming\\r\\nlike a dog, throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by turns\\r\\nrevealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I looked at the grand\\r\\nand glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved. The greenhorn had gone down.\\r\\nShooting himself perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg, now took an\\r\\ninstant\\'s glance around him, and seeming to see just how matters were, dived\\r\\ndown and disappeared. A few minutes more, and he rose again, one arm still\\r\\nstriking out, and with the other dragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked\\r\\nthem up. The poor bumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump;\\r\\nthe captain begged his pardon. From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a\\r\\nbarnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWas there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that he at all\\r\\ndeserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He only asked for\\r\\nwater\\xe2\\x80\\x94fresh water\\xe2\\x80\\x94something to wipe the brine off; that done, he put on dry\\r\\nclothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing\\r\\nthose around him, seemed to be saying to himself\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"It\\'s a mutual, joint-stock\\r\\nworld, in all meridians. We cannibals must help these Christians.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 14</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNantucket\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after a fine\\r\\nrun, we safely arrived in Nantucket.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of the\\r\\nworld it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely than the\\r\\nEddystone lighthouse. Look at it\\xe2\\x80\\x94 a mere hillock, and elbow of sand; all beach,\\r\\nwithout a background. There is more sand there than you would use in twenty\\r\\nyears as a substitute for blotting paper. Some gamesome wights will tell you\\r\\nthat they have to plant weeds there, they don\\'t grow naturally; that they\\r\\nimport Canada thistles; that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop\\r\\na leak in an oil cask; that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like\\r\\nbits of the true cross in Rome; that people there plant toadstools before their\\r\\nhouses, to get under the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an\\r\\noasis, three blades in a day\\'s walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand shoes,\\r\\nsomething like Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up, belted about,\\r\\nevery way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island of by the ocean, that\\r\\nto their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering as\\r\\nto the backs of sea turtles. But these extravaganzas only show that Nantucket\\r\\nis no Illinois.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLook now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by\\r\\nthe red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle swooped down upon\\r\\nthe New England coast and carried off an infant Indian in his talons. With loud\\r\\nlament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters.\\r\\nThey resolved to follow in the same direction. Setting out in their canoes,\\r\\nafter a perilous passage they discovered the island, and there they found an\\r\\nempty ivory casket,\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the poor little Indian\\'s skeleton.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhat wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should take to the\\r\\nsea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and quahogs in the sand; grown\\r\\nbolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more experienced, they pushed\\r\\noff in boats and captured cod; and at last, launching a navy of great ships on\\r\\nthe sea, explored this watery world; put an incessant belt of circumnavigations\\r\\nround it; peeped in at Behring\\'s Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans\\r\\ndeclared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the\\r\\nflood; most monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea,\\r\\nMastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that his very\\r\\npanics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from their\\r\\nant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like so many\\r\\nAlexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans,\\r\\nas the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America add Mexico to Texas, and\\r\\npile Cuba upon Canada; let the English overswarm all India, and hang out their\\r\\nblazing banner from the sun; two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the\\r\\nNantucketer\\'s. For the sea is his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires; other\\r\\nseamen having but a right of way through it. Merchant ships are but extension\\r\\nbridges; armed ones but floating forts; even pirates and privateers, though\\r\\nfollowing the sea as highwaymen the road. they but plunder other ships, other\\r\\nfragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw their living\\r\\nfrom the bottomless deep itself. The Nantucketer, he alone resides and riots on\\r\\nthe sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and fro\\r\\nploughing it as his own special plantation. There is his home; there lies his\\r\\nbusiness which a Noah\\'s flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all\\r\\nthe millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he\\r\\nhides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For\\r\\nyears he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells\\r\\nlike another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With\\r\\nthe landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep\\r\\nbetween billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls\\r\\nhis sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of\\r\\nwalruses and whales.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 15</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nChowder\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor,\\r\\nand Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no business that day, at\\r\\nleast none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of the Spouter-Inn had\\r\\nrecommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to\\r\\nbe the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover\\r\\nhe had assured us that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his\\r\\nchowders. In short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than\\r\\ntry pot-luck at the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping\\r\\na yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the\\r\\nlarboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner\\r\\nthree points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first man we met\\r\\nwhere the place was; these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at\\r\\nfirst, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow\\r\\nwarehouse\\xe2\\x80\\x94 our first point of departure\\xe2\\x80\\x94must be left on the larboard hand,\\r\\nwhereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard. However,\\r\\nby dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and then knocking up a\\r\\npeaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at last came to something which\\r\\nthere was no mistaking.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTwo enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses\\' ears, swung\\r\\nfrom the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an old doorway.\\r\\nThe horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other side, so that this old\\r\\ntop-mast looked not a little like a gallows. Perhaps I was over sensitive to\\r\\nsuch impressions at the time, but I could not help staring at this gallows with\\r\\na vague misgiving. A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two\\r\\nremaining horns; yes, two of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It\\'s\\r\\nominous, thinks I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port;\\r\\ntombstones staring at me in the whalemen\\'s chapel, and here a gallows! and a\\r\\npair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints\\r\\ntouching Tophet?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with\\r\\nyellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn, under a dull\\r\\nred lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured eye, and carrying on\\r\\na brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Get along with ye,\" said she to the man, \"or I\\'ll be combing ye!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Come on, Queequeg,\" said I, \"all right. There\\'s Mrs. Hussey.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving Mrs. Hussey\\r\\nentirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon making known our desires\\r\\nfor a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing further scolding for the\\r\\npresent, ushered us into a little room, and seating us at a table spread with\\r\\nthe relics of a recently concluded repast, turned round to us and said\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Clam or\\r\\nCod?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What\\'s that about Cods, ma\\'am?\" said I, with much politeness.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Clam or Cod?\" she repeated.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"A clam for supper? a cold clam; is that what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?\" says I,\\r\\n\"but that\\'s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time, ain\\'t it,\\r\\nMrs. Hussey?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple shirt who\\r\\nwas waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing but the word\\r\\n\"clam,\" Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen, and\\r\\nbawling out \"clam for two,\" disappeared.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Queequeg,\" said I, \"do you think that we can make out a supper for us both on\\r\\none clam?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHowever, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently\\r\\ncheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder came in, the\\r\\nmystery was delightfully explained. Oh! sweet friends, hearken to me. It was\\r\\nmade of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded\\r\\nship biscuits, and salted pork cut up into little flakes! the whole enriched\\r\\nwith butter, and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being\\r\\nsharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his\\r\\nfavourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly\\r\\nexcellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment\\r\\nand bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey\\'s clam and cod announcement, I thought I would\\r\\ntry a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word \"cod\"\\r\\nwith great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the savoury steam\\r\\ncame forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine\\r\\ncod-chowder was placed before us.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWe resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I<br>\\r\\nto myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head?<br>\\r\\nWhat\\'s that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people?<br>\\r\\n\"But look, Queequeg, ain\\'t that a live eel in your bowl?<br>\\r\\nWhere\\'s your harpoon?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its name;\\r\\nfor the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for breakfast, and\\r\\nchowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you began to look for\\r\\nfish-bones coming through your clothes. The area before the house was paved\\r\\nwith clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and\\r\\nHosea Hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was\\r\\na fishy flavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one\\r\\nmorning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen\\'s\\r\\nboats, I saw Hosea\\'s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and marching along\\r\\nthe sand with each foot in a cod\\'s decapitated head, looking very slipshod, I\\r\\nassure ye.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSupper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey\\r\\nconcerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede me up\\r\\nthe stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his harpoon; she\\r\\nallowed no harpoon in her chambers. \"Why not? said I; \"every true whaleman\\r\\nsleeps with his harpoon\\xe2\\x80\\x94 but why not?\" \"Because it\\'s dangerous,\" says she.\\r\\n\"Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort\\'nt v\\'y\\'ge of his, when he was\\r\\ngone four years and a half, with only three barrels of ile, was found dead in\\r\\nmy first floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no\\r\\nboarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr.\\r\\nQueequeg\" (for she had learned his name), \"I will just take this here iron, and\\r\\nkeep it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow for\\r\\nbreakfast, men?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Both,\" says I; \"and let\\'s have a couple of smoked herring by way of variety.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 16</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Ship\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no small\\r\\nconcern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been diligently\\r\\nconsulting Yojo\\xe2\\x80\\x94the name of his black little god\\xe2\\x80\\x94 and Yojo had told him two or\\r\\nthree times over, and strongly insisted upon it everyway, that instead of our\\r\\ngoing together among the whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our\\r\\ncraft; instead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of\\r\\nthe ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us;\\r\\nand, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to\\r\\nmyself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though\\r\\nit had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship myself,\\r\\nfor the present irrespective of Queequeg.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great\\r\\nconfidence in the excellence of Yojo\\'s judgment and surprising forecast of\\r\\nthings; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of\\r\\ngod, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not\\r\\nsucceed in his benevolent designs.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, this plan of Queequeg\\'s or rather Yojo\\'s, touching the selection of our\\r\\ncraft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied on Queequeg\\'s\\r\\nsagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes\\r\\nsecurely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was\\r\\nobliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with\\r\\na determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that\\r\\ntrifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo\\r\\nin our little bedroom\\xe2\\x80\\x94for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan,\\r\\nor day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; how\\r\\nit was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several\\r\\ntimes, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles\\xe2\\x80\\x94 leaving Queequeg,\\r\\nthen, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial\\r\\nfire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged\\r\\nsauntering, and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three ships up\\r\\nfor three-years\\' voyages\\xe2\\x80\\x94The Devil-Dam the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. Devil-dam,\\r\\nI do not know the origin of; Tit-bit is obvious; Pequod you will no doubt\\r\\nremember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now\\r\\nextinct as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-Dam; from her,\\r\\nhopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked\\r\\naround her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nYou may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I know;\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\nsquare-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box galliots, and what\\r\\nnot; but take my word for it, you never saw such a rare old craft as this same\\r\\nrare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old school, rather small if anything;\\r\\nwith an old-fashioned claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned and\\r\\nweather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull\\'s\\r\\ncomplexion was darkened like a French grenadier\\'s, who has alike fought in\\r\\nEgypt and Siberia. Her venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts\\xe2\\x80\\x94cut somewhere\\r\\non the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a\\r\\ngale\\xe2\\x80\\x94her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of\\r\\nCologne. Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped\\r\\nflag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Beckett bled. But to all these her old\\r\\nantiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild\\r\\nbusiness that for more than half a century she had followed. Old Captain Peleg,\\r\\nmany years her chief-mate, before he commanded another vessel of his own, and\\r\\nnow a retired seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod,\\xe2\\x80\\x94this old\\r\\nPeleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had built upon her original\\r\\ngrotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and\\r\\ndevice, unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake\\'s carved buckler or\\r\\nbedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck\\r\\nheavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A cannibal\\r\\nof a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies. All\\r\\nround, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw,\\r\\nwith the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to\\r\\nfasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran not through base\\r\\nblocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a\\r\\nturnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that\\r\\ntiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her\\r\\nhereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like\\r\\nthe Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble\\r\\ncraft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things are touched with that.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority, in\\r\\norder to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw nobody;\\r\\nbut I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or rather wigwam, pitched\\r\\na little behind the main-mast. It seemed only a temporary erection used in\\r\\nport. It was of a conical shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long,\\r\\nhuge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the\\r\\njaws of the right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of\\r\\nthese slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex\\r\\nunited in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like a\\r\\ntop-knot on some old Pottowotamie Sachem\\'s head. A triangular opening faced\\r\\ntowards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view\\r\\nforward.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by his\\r\\naspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the ship\\'s work\\r\\nsuspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of command. He was seated\\r\\non an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over with curious carving; and\\r\\nthe bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff\\r\\nof which the wigwam was constructed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the\\r\\nelderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily\\r\\nrolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there was a fine\\r\\nand almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his\\r\\neyes, which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales,\\r\\nand always looking to windward;\\xe2\\x80\\x94 for this causes the muscles about the eyes to\\r\\nbecome pursed together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Is this the Captain of the Pequod?\" said I, advancing to the door of the tent.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Supposing it be the Captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?\" he\\r\\ndemanded.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I was thinking of shipping.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer\\xe2\\x80\\x94 ever been in a stove\\r\\nboat?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"No, Sir, I never have.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say\\xe2\\x80\\x94eh?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn.<br>\\r\\nI\\'ve been several voyages in the merchant service, and I think that-\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that leg?\\xe2\\x80\\x94I\\'ll\\r\\ntake that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of the merchant service\\r\\nto me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now ye feel considerable proud\\r\\nof having served in those marchant ships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want\\r\\nto go a whaling, eh?\\xe2\\x80\\x94it looks a little suspicious, don\\'t it, eh?\\xe2\\x80\\x94Hast not been\\r\\na pirate, hast thou?\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?\\xe2\\x80\\x94Dost not\\r\\nthink of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of these\\r\\nhalf humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated Quakerish\\r\\nNantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all\\r\\naliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the Vineyard.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of shipping\\r\\nye.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Who is Captain Ahab, sir?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg\\xe2\\x80\\x94that\\'s who ye are speaking to, young man.\\r\\nIt belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the\\r\\nvoyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We are part owners and\\r\\nagents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know what whaling is, as\\r\\nthou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind\\r\\nyourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou\\r\\nwilt find that he has only one leg.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed up,\\r\\ncrunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat!\\xe2\\x80\\x94ah, ah!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at the\\r\\nhearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I could,\\r\\n\"What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know there was any\\r\\npeculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed I might have inferred\\r\\nas much from the simple fact of the accident.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d\\'ye see; thou dost not\\r\\ntalk shark a bit. Sure, ye\\'ve been to sea before now; sure of that?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Sir,\" said I, \"I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the\\r\\nmerchant-\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant service\\xe2\\x80\\x94 don\\'t\\r\\naggravate me\\xe2\\x80\\x94I won\\'t have it. But let us understand each other. I have given\\r\\nthee a hint about what whaling is! do ye yet feel inclined for it?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I do, sir.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale\\'s\\r\\nthroat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be got\\r\\nrid of, that is; which I don\\'t take to be the fact.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out by\\r\\nexperience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the world?\\r\\nWas not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just step forward there,\\r\\nand take a peep over the weather bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye\\r\\nsee there.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing\\r\\nexactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But concentrating all\\r\\nhis crow\\'s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me on the errand.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nGoing forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship\\r\\nswinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing towards\\r\\nthe open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but exceedingly monotonous and\\r\\nforbidding; not the slightest variety that I could see.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Well, what\\'s the report?\" said Peleg when I came back; \"what did ye see?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Not much,\" I replied\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"nothing but water; considerable horizon though, and\\r\\nthere\\'s a squall coming up, I think.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Well, what dost thou think then of seeing the world?<br>\\r\\nDo ye wish to go round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh?<br>\\r\\nCan\\'t ye see the world where you stand?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the Pequod\\r\\nwas as good a ship as any\\xe2\\x80\\x94I thought the best\\xe2\\x80\\x94 and all this I now repeated to\\r\\nPeleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness to ship me.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,\" he added\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"come along with\\r\\nye.\" And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSeated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising\\r\\nfigure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad who along with Captain Peleg was one\\r\\nof the largest owners of the vessel; the other shares, as is sometimes the case\\r\\nin these ports, being held by a crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless\\r\\nchildren, and chancery wards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or\\r\\na foot of plank, or a nail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their\\r\\nmoney in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state\\r\\nstocks bringing in good interest.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a Quaker, the\\r\\nisland having been originally settled by that sect; and to this day its\\r\\ninhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the\\r\\nQuaker, only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and\\r\\nheterogeneous. For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all\\r\\nsailors and whale-hunters. They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a\\r\\nvengeance.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture\\r\\nnames\\xe2\\x80\\x94a singularly common fashion on the island\\xe2\\x80\\x94 and in childhood naturally\\r\\nimbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker idiom; still, from\\r\\nthe audacious, daring, and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives,\\r\\nstrangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of\\r\\ncharacter, not unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And\\r\\nwhen these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a\\r\\nglobular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and\\r\\nseclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath\\r\\nconstellations never seen here at the north, been led to think untraditionally\\r\\nand independently; receiving all nature\\'s sweet or savage impressions fresh\\r\\nfrom her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but\\r\\nwith some help from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty\\r\\nlanguage\\xe2\\x80\\x94that man makes one in a whole nation\\'s census\\xe2\\x80\\x94 a mighty pageant\\r\\ncreature, formed for noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him,\\r\\ndramatically regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what\\r\\nseems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For all\\r\\nmen tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure of this,\\r\\nO young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. But, as yet we have not\\r\\nto do with such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if indeed\\r\\npeculiar, it only results again from another phase of the Quaker, modified by\\r\\nindividual circumstances.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLike Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman. But\\r\\nunlike Captain Peleg\\xe2\\x80\\x94who cared not a rush for what are called serious things,\\r\\nand indeed deemed those self-same serious things the veriest of all\\r\\ntrifles\\xe2\\x80\\x94Captain Bildad had not only been originally educated according to the\\r\\nstrictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and\\r\\nthe sight of many unclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn\\xe2\\x80\\x94all that had\\r\\nnot moved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered\\r\\none angle of his vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack\\r\\nof common consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from\\r\\nconscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself had\\r\\nillimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human\\r\\nbloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of\\r\\nleviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his days, the pious\\r\\nBildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do not know; but it did\\r\\nnot seem to concern him much, and very probably he had long since come to the\\r\\nsage and sensible conclusion that a man\\'s religion is one thing, and this\\r\\npractical world quite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little\\r\\ncabin boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad\\r\\nshad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief mate, and\\r\\ncaptain, and finally a shipowner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his\\r\\nadventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of\\r\\nsixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his\\r\\nwell-earned income.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an incorrigible old\\r\\nhunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard task-master. They told me in\\r\\nNantucket, though it certainly seems a curious story, that when he sailed the\\r\\nold Categut whaleman, his crew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried\\r\\nashore to the hospital, sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man,\\r\\nespecially for a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the\\r\\nleast. He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he\\r\\ngot an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When\\r\\nBildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-colored eye intently looking at you,\\r\\nmade you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch something\\xe2\\x80\\x94a hammer or a\\r\\nmarling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other, never mind what.\\r\\nIndolence and idleness perished from before him. His own person was the exact\\r\\nembodiment of his utilitarian character. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no\\r\\nspare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to\\r\\nit, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSuch, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed\\r\\nCaptain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks was small; and\\r\\nthere, bolt upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and never leaned, and\\r\\nthis to save his coat-tails. His broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs\\r\\nwere stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and\\r\\nspectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Bildad,\" cried Captain Peleg, \"at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been studying\\r\\nthose Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain knowledge. How\\r\\nfar ye got, Bildad?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate, Bildad,\\r\\nwithout noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing me,\\r\\nglanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"He says he\\'s our man, Bildad,\" said Peleg, \"he wants to ship.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Dost thee?\" said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I dost,\" said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What do ye think of him, Bildad?\" said Peleg.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"He\\'ll do,\" said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at his book\\r\\nin a mumbling tone quite audible.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his\\r\\nfriend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said nothing, only\\r\\nlooking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the\\r\\nship\\'s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a little\\r\\ntable. I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms I\\r\\nwould be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already aware that in the\\r\\nwhaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the captain,\\r\\nreceived certain shares of the profits called lays, and that these lays were\\r\\nproportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of\\r\\nthe ship\\'s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own\\r\\nlay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could\\r\\nsteer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had\\r\\nheard I should be offered at least the 275th lay\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is, the 275th part of the\\r\\nclear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to. And\\r\\nthough the 275th lay was what they call a rather long lay, yet it was better\\r\\nthan nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the\\r\\nclothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years\\' beef and\\r\\nboard, for which I would not have to pay one stiver.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\\r\\nfortune\\xe2\\x80\\x94and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those that never\\r\\ntake on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the world is ready to\\r\\nboard and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder\\r\\nCloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair\\r\\nthing, but would not have been surprised had I been offered the 200th,\\r\\nconsidering I was of a broad-shouldered make.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about receiving\\r\\na generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard something of both\\r\\nCaptain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad; how that they being the\\r\\nprincipal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore the other and more\\r\\ninconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the whole management of the\\r\\nship\\'s affairs to these two. And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad\\r\\nmight have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found\\r\\nhim on board the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his\\r\\nBible as if at his own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a\\r\\npen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that\\r\\nhe was such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded us,\\r\\nbut went on mumbling to himself out of his book, \"Lay not up for yourselves\\r\\ntreasures upon earth, where moth-\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Well, Captain Bildad,\" interrupted Peleg, \"what d\\'ye say, what lay shall we\\r\\ngive this young man?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Thou knowest best,\" was the sepulchral reply, \"the seven hundred and\\r\\nseventy-seventh wouldn\\'t be too much, would it?\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\'where moth and rust do\\r\\ncorrupt, but lay-\\'\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLay, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and seventy-seventh!\\r\\nWell, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one, shall not lay up many\\r\\nlays here below, where moth and rust do corrupt. It was an exceedingly long lay\\r\\nthat, indeed; and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first\\r\\ndeceive a landsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven\\r\\nhundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make\\r\\na teenth of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and\\r\\nseventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and\\r\\nseventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,\" cried Peleg, Thou dost not want to swindle this\\r\\nyoung man! he must have more than that.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,\" again said Bildad, without lifting his\\r\\neyes; and then went on mumbling\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"for where your treasure is, there will your\\r\\nheart be also.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,\" said Peleg, \"do ye hear\\r\\nthat, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said, \"Captain\\r\\nPeleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the duty thou owest\\r\\nto the other owners of this ship\\xe2\\x80\\x94widows and orphans, many of them\\xe2\\x80\\x94 and that if\\r\\nwe too abundantly reward the labors of this young man, we may be taking the\\r\\nbread from those widows and those orphans. The seven hundred and\\r\\nseventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Thou Bildad!\" roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the cabin.<br>\\r\\n\"Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these matters,<br>\\r\\nI would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy<br>\\r\\nenough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape Horn.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Captain Peleg,\" said Bildad steadily, \"thy conscience may be drawing ten\\r\\ninches of water, or ten fathoms, I can\\'t tell; but as thou art still an\\r\\nimpenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a\\r\\nleaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit,\\r\\nCaptain Peleg.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye insult\\r\\nme. It\\'s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that he\\'s bound to\\r\\nhell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and start my soulbolts,\\r\\nbut I\\'ll\\xe2\\x80\\x94I\\'ll\\xe2\\x80\\x94yes, I\\'ll swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on. Out\\r\\nof the cabin, ye canting, drab-colored son of a wooden gun\\xe2\\x80\\x94a straight wake with\\r\\nye!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous\\r\\noblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAlarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible\\r\\nowners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a\\r\\nvessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded, I stepped aside from\\r\\nthe door to give egress to Bildad, who, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to\\r\\nvanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat\\r\\ndown again on the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest\\r\\nintention of withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his\\r\\nways. As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more\\r\\nleft in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as\\r\\nif still nervously agitated. \"Whew!\" he whistled at last\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"the squall\\'s gone off\\r\\nto leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend\\r\\nthat pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs the grindstone. That\\'s he; thank\\r\\nye, Bildad. Now then, my young man, Ishmael\\'s thy name, didn\\'t ye say? Well\\r\\nthen, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Captain Peleg,\" said I, \"I have a friend with me who wants to ship too\\xe2\\x80\\x94 shall\\r\\nI bring him down to-morrow?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"To be sure,\" said Peleg. \"Fetch him along, and we\\'ll look at him.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What lay does he want?\" groaned Bildad, glancing up from the Book in which he\\r\\nhad again been burying himself.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,\" said Peleg. \"Has he ever whaled it\\r\\nany?\" turning to me.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Well, bring him along then.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I had done\\r\\na good morning\\'s work, and that the Pequod was the identical ship that Yojo had\\r\\nprovided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain with\\r\\nwhom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in many cases, a\\r\\nwhale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all her crew on board,\\r\\nere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command; for\\r\\nsometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so\\r\\nexceedingly brief, that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing\\r\\nconcernment of that sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in\\r\\nport, but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is\\r\\nalways as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself\\r\\ninto his hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain\\r\\nAhab was to be found.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It\\'s all right enough; thou art\\r\\nshipped.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Yes, but I should like to see him.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"But I don\\'t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don\\'t know exactly what\\'s\\r\\nthe matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of sick, and\\r\\nyet he don\\'t look so. In fact, he ain\\'t sick; but no, he isn\\'t well either. Any\\r\\nhow, young man, he won\\'t always see me, so I don\\'t suppose he will thee. He\\'s a\\r\\nqueer man, Captain Ahab\\xe2\\x80\\x94 so some think\\xe2\\x80\\x94but a good one. Oh, thou\\'lt like him\\r\\nwell enough; no fear, no fear. He\\'s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain\\r\\nAhab; doesn\\'t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen.\\r\\nMark ye, be forewarned; Ahab\\'s above the common; Ahab\\'s been in colleges, as\\r\\nwell as \\'mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed\\r\\nhis fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the\\r\\nkeenest and the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain\\'t Captain Bildad;\\r\\nno, and he ain\\'t Captain Peleg; he\\'s Ahab, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest,\\r\\nwas a crowned king!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not\\r\\nlick his blood?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Come hither to me\\xe2\\x80\\x94hither, hither,\" said Peleg, with a significance in his eye\\r\\nthat almost startled me. \"Look ye, lad; never say that on board the Pequod.\\r\\nNever say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself .\\'Twas a foolish,\\r\\nignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died when he was only a\\r\\ntwelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name\\r\\nwould somehow prove prophetic. And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee\\r\\nthe same. I wish to warn thee. It\\'s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I\\'ve\\r\\nsailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is\\xe2\\x80\\x94 a good man\\xe2\\x80\\x94not a pious,\\r\\ngood man, like Bildad, but a swearing good man\\xe2\\x80\\x94something like me\\xe2\\x80\\x94only there\\'s a\\r\\ngood deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I\\r\\nknow that on the passage home he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but\\r\\nit was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about,\\r\\nas any one might see. I know, too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyage\\r\\nby that accursed whale, he\\'s been a kind of moody\\xe2\\x80\\x94 desperate moody, and savage\\r\\nsometimes; but that will all pass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and\\r\\nassure thee, young man, it\\'s better to sail with a moody good captain than a\\r\\nlaughing bad one. So good-bye to thee\\xe2\\x80\\x94and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he\\r\\nhappens to have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife\\xe2\\x80\\x94not three voyages\\r\\nwedded\\xe2\\x80\\x94a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that old man\\r\\nhad a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No,\\r\\nno, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been incidentally\\r\\nrevealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain wild vagueness of\\r\\npainfulness concerning him. And somehow, at the time, I felt a sympathy and a\\r\\nsorrow for him, but for I don\\'t know what, unless it was the cruel loss of his\\r\\nleg. And yet I also felt a strange awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I\\r\\ncannot at all describe, was not exactly awe; I do not know what it was. But I\\r\\nfelt it; and it did not disincline me towards him; though I felt impatience at\\r\\nwhat seemed like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then.\\r\\nHowever, my thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so that for\\r\\nthe present dark Ahab slipped my mind.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 17</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Ramadan\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs Queequeg\\'s Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue all day, I\\r\\ndid not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for I cherish the\\r\\ngreatest respect towards everybody\\'s religious obligations, never mind how\\r\\ncomical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of\\r\\nants worshipping a toad-stool; or those other creatures in certain parts of our\\r\\nearth, who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets,\\r\\nbow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of\\r\\nthe inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these things,\\r\\nand not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals, pagans and what\\r\\nnot, because of their half-crazy conceits on these subjects.

Queequeg thought he knew what he was about, I\\r\\nsuppose; he seemed to be content; and there let him rest. All our arguing with\\r\\nhim would not avail; let him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us\\r\\nall\\xe2\\x80\\x94Presbyterians and Pagans alike\\xe2\\x80\\x94 for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked\\r\\nabout the head, and sadly need mending.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTowards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and rituals must\\r\\nbe over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door; but no answer. I tried\\r\\nto open it, but it was fastened inside. \"Queequeg,\" said I softly through the\\r\\nkey-hole:\\xe2\\x80\\x94all silent. \"I say, Queequeg! why don\\'t you speak? It\\'s I\\xe2\\x80\\x94Ishmael.\"\\r\\nBut all remained still as before. I began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him\\r\\nsuch abundant time; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit. I looked\\r\\nthrough the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room, the\\r\\nkey-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one. I could only see part of\\r\\nthe foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing more. I was\\r\\nsurprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg\\'s\\r\\nharpoon, which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our\\r\\nmounting to the chamber. That\\'s strange, thought I; but at any rate, since the\\r\\nharpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore\\r\\nhe must be inside here, and no possible mistake.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Queequeg!\\xe2\\x80\\x94Queequeg!\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94all still. Something must have happened. Apoplexy! I\\r\\ntried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted. Running down stairs,\\r\\nI quickly stated my suspicions to the first person I met\\xe2\\x80\\x94the chamber-maid. \"La!\\r\\nla!\" she cried, \"I thought something must be the matter. I went to make the bed\\r\\nafter breakfast, and the door was locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it\\'s\\r\\nbeen just so silent ever since. But I thought, may be, you had both gone off\\r\\nand locked your baggage in for safe keeping. La! La, ma\\'am!\\xe2\\x80\\x94Mistress! murder!\\r\\nMrs. Hussey! apoplexy!\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94and with these cries she ran towards the kitchen, I\\r\\nfollowing.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a vinegar-cruet\\r\\nin the other, having just broken away from the occupation of attending to the\\r\\ncastors, and scolding her little black boy meantime.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Wood-house!\" cried I, \"which way to it? Run for God\\'s sake, and fetch\\r\\nsomething to pry open the door\\xe2\\x80\\x94the axe!\\xe2\\x80\\x94the axe! he\\'s had a stroke; depend upon\\r\\nit!\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs again empty-handed,\\r\\nwhen Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard-pot and vinegar-cruet, and the entire\\r\\ncastor of her countenance.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter with you, young man?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Get the axe! For God\\'s sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I pry it\\r\\nopen!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Look here,\" said the landlady, quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet, so as\\r\\nto have one hand free; \"look here; are you talking about prying open any of my\\r\\ndoors?\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94 and with that she seized my arm. \"What\\'s the matter with you? What\\'s\\r\\nthe matter with you, shipmate?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand the whole\\r\\ncase. Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of her nose, she\\r\\nruminated for an instant; then exclaimed\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"No! I haven\\'t seen it since I put it\\r\\nthere.\" Running to a little closet under the landing of the stairs, she glanced\\r\\nin, and returning, told me that Queequeg\\'s harpoon was missing. \"He\\'s killed\\r\\nhimself,\" she cried. \"It\\'s unfort\\'nate Stiggs done over again there goes\\r\\nanother counterpane\\xe2\\x80\\x94God pity his poor mother!\\xe2\\x80\\x94 it will be the ruin of my house.\\r\\nHas the poor lad a sister? Where\\'s that girl?\\xe2\\x80\\x94there, Betty, go to Snarles the\\r\\nPainter, and tell him to paint me a sign, with\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"no suicides permitted here, and\\r\\nno smoking in the parlor;\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94might as well kill both birds at once. Kill? The\\r\\nLord be merciful to his ghost! What\\'s that noise there? You, young man, avast\\r\\nthere!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force open the\\r\\ndoor.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I won\\'t allow it; I won\\'t have my premises spoiled. Go for the locksmith,\\r\\nthere\\'s one about a mile from here. But avast!\" putting her hand in her side\\r\\npocket, \"here\\'s a key that\\'ll fit, I guess; let\\'s see.\" And with that, she\\r\\nturned it in the lock; but alas! Queequeg\\'s supplemental bolt remained\\r\\nunwithdrawn within.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Have to burst it open,\" said I, and was running down the entry a little, for a\\r\\ngood start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing I should not break\\r\\ndown her premises; but I tore from her, and with a sudden bodily rush dashed\\r\\nmyself full against the mark.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWith a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming against the\\r\\nwall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good heavens! there sat\\r\\nQueequeg, altogether cool and self-collected; right in the middle of the room;\\r\\nsquatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on top of his head. He looked neither\\r\\none way nor the other way but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of\\r\\nactive life.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Queequeg,\" said I, going up to him, \"Queequeg, what\\'s the matter with you?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"He hain\\'t been a sittin\\' so all day, has he?\" said the landlady.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt like\\r\\npushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost intolerable,\\r\\nit seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained; especially, as in all\\r\\nprobability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours, going too\\r\\nwithout his regular meals.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Mrs. Hussey,\" said I, \"he\\'s alive at all events; so leave us, if you please,\\r\\nand I will see to this strange affair myself.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nClosing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon Queequeg to\\r\\ntake a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could do\\xe2\\x80\\x94for all my polite\\r\\narts and blandishments\\xe2\\x80\\x94 he would not move a peg, nor say a single word, nor\\r\\neven look at me, nor notice my presence in any the slightest way.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do they\\r\\nfast on their hams that way in his native island. It must be so; yes, it\\'s a\\r\\npart of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he\\'ll get up sooner or\\r\\nlater, no doubt. It can\\'t last for ever, thank God, and his Ramadan only comes\\r\\nonce a year; and I don\\'t believe it\\'s very punctual then.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long stories\\r\\nof some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage, as they called it\\r\\n(that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig, confined to the north\\r\\nof the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only); after listening to these\\r\\nplum-puddingers till nearly eleven o\\'clock, I went up stairs to go to bed,\\r\\nfeeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his\\r\\nRamadan to a termination. But no; there he was just where I had left him; he\\r\\nhad not stirred an inch. I began to grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright\\r\\nsenseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams\\r\\nin a cold room, holding a piece of wood on his head.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"For heaven\\'s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and have some\\r\\nsupper. You\\'ll starve; you\\'ll kill yourself, Queequeg.\" But not a word did he\\r\\nreply.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDespairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep; and no\\r\\ndoubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to turning in, I\\r\\ntook my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as it promised to be a\\r\\nvery cold night; and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on. For some\\r\\ntime, do all I would, I could not get into the faintest doze. I had blown out\\r\\nthe candle; and the mere thought of Queequeg\\xe2\\x80\\x94 not four feet off\\xe2\\x80\\x94sitting there\\r\\nin that uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really\\r\\nwretched. Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake\\r\\npagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of day;\\r\\nwhen, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he had been\\r\\nscrewed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the\\r\\nwindow, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but with a cheerful look;\\r\\nlimped towards me where I lay; pressed his forehead again against mine; and\\r\\nsaid his Ramadan was over.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person\\'s religion, be it\\r\\nwhat it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person,\\r\\nbecause that other person don\\'t believe it also. But when a man\\'s religion\\r\\nbecomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment to him; and, in fine,\\r\\nmakes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in; then I think it high\\r\\ntime to take that individual aside and argue the point with him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd just so I now did with Queequeg. \"Queequeg,\" said I, \"get into bed now, and\\r\\nlie and listen to me.\" I then went on, beginning with the rise and progress of\\r\\nthe primitive religions, and coming down to the various religions of the\\r\\npresent time, during which time I labored to show Queequeg that all these\\r\\nLents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were\\r\\nstark nonsense; bad for the health; useless for the soul; opposed, in short, to\\r\\nthe obvious laws of Hygiene and common sense. I told him, too, that he being in\\r\\nother things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me,\\r\\nvery badly pained me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this\\r\\nridiculous Ramadan of his. Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in;\\r\\nhence the spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be\\r\\nhalf-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such\\r\\nmelancholy notions about their hereafters. In one word, Queequeg, said I,\\r\\nrather digressively; hell is an idea first born on an undigested\\r\\napple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias\\r\\nnurtured by Ramadans.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia;\\r\\nexpressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it in. He said no; only\\r\\nupon one memorable occasion. It was after a great feast given by his father the\\r\\nking on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been\\r\\nkilled by about two o\\'clock in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that\\r\\nvery evening.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"No more, Queequeg,\" said I, shuddering; \"that will do;\" for I knew the\\r\\ninferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who had\\r\\nvisited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom, when a great\\r\\nbattle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden\\r\\nof the victor; and then, one by one, they were placed in great wooden\\r\\ntrenchers, and garnished round like a pilau, with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and\\r\\nwith some parsley in their mouths, were sent round with the victor\\'s\\r\\ncompliments to all his friends, just as though these presents were so many\\r\\nChristmas turkeys.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAfter all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression\\r\\nupon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow seemed dull of hearing\\r\\non that important subject, unless considered from his own point of view; and,\\r\\nin the second place, he did not more than one third understand me, couch my\\r\\nideas simply as I would; and, finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal\\r\\nmore about the true religion than I did. He looked at me with a sort of\\r\\ncondescending concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that\\r\\nsuch a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan\\r\\npiety.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty\\r\\nbreakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not make much\\r\\nprofit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the Pequod, sauntering\\r\\nalong, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 18</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHis Mark\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg\\r\\ncarrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from\\r\\nhis wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal, and\\r\\nfurthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft, unless\\r\\nthey previously produced their papers.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?\" said I, now jumping on the bulwarks,\\r\\nand leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I mean,\" he replied, \"he must show his papers.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Yes,\" said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from behind\\r\\nPeleg\\'s, out of the wigwam. \"He must show that he\\'s converted. Son of\\r\\ndarkness,\" he added, turning to Queequeg, \"art thou at present in communion\\r\\nwith any Christian church?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Why,\" said I, \"he\\'s a member of the first Congregational Church.\" Here be it\\r\\nsaid, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at last come to be\\r\\nconverted into the churches.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"First Congregational Church,\" cried Bildad, \"what! that worships in Deacon\\r\\nDeuteronomy Coleman\\'s meeting-house?\" and so saying, taking out his spectacles,\\r\\nhe rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief, and putting them on\\r\\nvery carefully, came out of the wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks,\\r\\ntook a good long look at Queequeg.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"How long hath he been a member?\" he then said, turning to me; \"not very long,\\r\\nI rather guess, young man.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"No,\" said Peleg, \"and he hasn\\'t been baptized right either, or it would have\\r\\nwashed some of that devil\\'s blue off his face.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Do tell, now,\" cried Bildad, \"is this Philistine a regular member of Deacon\\r\\nDeuteronomy\\'s meeting? I never saw him going there, and I pass it every Lord\\'s\\r\\nday.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,\" said I; \"all I\\r\\nknow is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First Congregational\\r\\nChurch. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Young man,\" said Bildad sternly, \"thou art skylarking with me\\xe2\\x80\\x94 explain\\r\\nthyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFinding myself thus hard pushed, I replied, \"I mean, sir, the same ancient\\r\\nCatholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there, and Queequeg here,\\r\\nand all of us, and every mother\\'s son and soul of us belong; the great and\\r\\neverlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world; we all belong\\r\\nto that; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the\\r\\ngrand belief; in that we all join hands.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Splice, thou mean\\'st splice hands,\" cried Peleg, drawing nearer. \"Young man,\\r\\nyou\\'d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast hand; I never heard\\r\\na better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy\\xe2\\x80\\x94why Father Mapple himself couldn\\'t beat it,\\r\\nand he\\'s reckoned something. Come aboard, come aboard: never mind about the\\r\\npapers.

I say, Quohog, or whatever your name\\r\\nis, did you ever stand in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a\\r\\nfish?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWithout saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon the\\r\\nbulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats hanging to the\\r\\nside; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his harpoon, cried out in\\r\\nsome such way as this:\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Cap\\'ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him? well, spose\\r\\nhim one whale eye, well, den!\" and taking sharp aim at it, he darted the iron\\r\\nright over old Bildad\\'s broad brim, clean across the ship\\'s decks, and struck\\r\\nthe glistening tar spot out of sight.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Now,\" said Queequeg, quietly, hauling in the line, \"spos-ee him whale-e eye;\\r\\nwhy, dad whale dead.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Quick, Bildad,\" said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close vicinity of\\r\\nthe flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin gangway. \"Quick, I say, you\\r\\nBildad, and get the ship\\'s papers. We must have Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog,\\r\\nin one of our boats. Look ye, Quohog, we\\'ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and\\r\\nthat\\'s more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon enrolled\\r\\namong the same ship\\'s company to which I myself belonged.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for\\r\\nsigning, he turned to me and said, \"I guess, Quohog there don\\'t know how to\\r\\nwrite, does he? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name or make thy\\r\\nmark?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken part in\\r\\nsimilar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the offered pen, copied\\r\\nupon the paper, in the proper place, an exact counterpart of a queer round\\r\\nfigure which was tattooed upon his arm; so that through Captain Peleg\\'s\\r\\nobstinate mistake touching his appellative, it stood something like this:\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\nQuohog. his X mark. Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly\\r\\neyeing Queequeg, and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets\\r\\nof his broadskirted drab coat took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one\\r\\nentitled \"The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,\" placed it in Queequeg\\'s\\r\\nhands, and then grasping them and the book with both his, looked earnestly into\\r\\nhis eyes, and said, \"Son of darkness, I must do my duty by thee; I am part\\r\\nowner of this ship, and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew; if thou\\r\\nstill clingest to thy Pagan ways, which I sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain\\r\\nnot for aye a Belial bondsman.

There was young\\r\\nNat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard;\\r\\nhe joined the meeting, and never came to good. He got so frightened about his\\r\\nplaguy soul, that he shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear of\\r\\nafter-claps, in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Peleg! Peleg!\" said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, \"thou thyself, as I\\r\\nmyself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what it is to have\\r\\nthe fear of death; how, then, can\\'st thou prate in this ungodly guise. Thou\\r\\nbeliest thine own heart, Peleg.

There he stood, very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who were\\r\\nmending a top-sail in the waist.

But we had not gone perhaps above a hundred\\r\\nyards, when chancing to turn a corner, and looking back as I did so, who should\\r\\nbe seen but Elijah following us, though at a distance. Somehow, the sight of\\r\\nhim struck me so, that I said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but\\r\\npassed on with my comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the\\r\\nsame corner that we did. He did; and then it seemed to me that he was dogging\\r\\nus, but with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine. This\\r\\ncircumstance, coupled with his ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing,\\r\\nshrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and\\r\\nhalf-apprehensions, and all connected with the Pequod; and Captain Ahab; and\\r\\nthe leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver calabash; and what\\r\\nCaptain Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship the day previous; and the\\r\\nprediction of the squaw Tistig; and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail;\\r\\nand a hundred other shadowy things.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really dogging\\r\\nus or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg, and on that side\\r\\nof it retraced our steps. But Elijah passed on, without seeming to notice us.\\r\\nThis relieved me; and once more, and finally as it seemed to me, I pronounced\\r\\nhim in my heart, a humbug.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 20</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAll Astir\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod. Not only\\r\\nwere the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on board, and bolts\\r\\nof canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything betokened that the ship\\'s\\r\\npreparations were hurrying to a close. Captain Peleg seldom or never went\\r\\nashore, but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: Bildad\\r\\ndid all the purchasing and providing at the stores; and the men employed in the\\r\\nhold and on the rigging were working till long after night-fall.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOn the day following Queequeg\\'s signing the articles, word was given at all the\\r\\ninns where the ship\\'s company were stopping, that their chests must be on board\\r\\nbefore night, for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing. So\\r\\nQueequeg and I got down our traps, resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the\\r\\nlast. But it seems they always give very long notice in these cases, and the\\r\\nship did not sail for several days. But no wonder; there was a good deal to be\\r\\ndone, and there is no telling how many things to be thought of, before the\\r\\nPequod was fully equipped.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEvery one knows what a multitude of things\\xe2\\x80\\x94beds, sauce-pans, knives and forks,\\r\\nshovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are indispensable to\\r\\nthe business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling, which necessitates a\\r\\nthree-years\\' housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far from all grocers,\\r\\ncostermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And though this also holds true of\\r\\nmerchant vessels, yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen. For\\r\\nbesides the great length of the whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar\\r\\nto the prosecution of the fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at\\r\\nthe remote harbors usually frequented, it must be remembered, that of all\\r\\nships, whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds, and\\r\\nespecially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the\\r\\nsuccess of the voyage most depends. Hence, the spare boats, spare spars, and\\r\\nspare lines and harpoons, and spare everythings, almost, but a spare Captain\\r\\nand duplicate ship.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of the Pequod\\r\\nhad been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water, fuel, and iron\\r\\nhoops and staves. But, as before hinted, for some time there was a continual\\r\\nfetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of things, both large\\r\\nand small.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nChief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain Bildad\\'s\\r\\nsister, a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit, but\\r\\nwithal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if she could help it,\\r\\nnothing should be found wanting in the Pequod, after once fairly getting to\\r\\nsea. At one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the\\r\\nsteward\\'s pantry; another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate\\'s\\r\\ndesk, where he kept his log; a third time with a roll of flannel for the small\\r\\nof some one\\'s rheumatic back. Never did any woman better deserve her name,\\r\\nwhich was Charity\\xe2\\x80\\x94Aunt Charity, as everybody called her. And like a sister of\\r\\ncharity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither, ready\\r\\nto turn her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety, comfort,\\r\\nand consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother Bildad was\\r\\nconcerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of well-saved dollars.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on board,\\r\\nas she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and a still longer\\r\\nwhaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor Captain Peleg at all\\r\\nbackward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him a long list of the articles\\r\\nneeded, and at every fresh arrival, down went his mark opposite that article\\r\\nupon the paper. Every once in a while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone\\r\\nden, roaring at the men down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the\\r\\nmast-head, and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDuring these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the craft, and\\r\\nas often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and when he was going to\\r\\ncome on board his ship. To these questions they would answer, that he was\\r\\ngetting better and better, and was expected aboard every day; meantime, the two\\r\\nCaptains, Peleg and Bildad, could attend to everything necessary to fit the\\r\\nvessel for the voyage. If I had been downright honest with myself, I would have\\r\\nseen very plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this\\r\\nway to so long a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be\\r\\nthe absolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea.\\r\\nBut when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be already\\r\\ninvolved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even\\r\\nfrom himself. And much this way it was with me. I said nothing, and tried to\\r\\nthink nothing.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail.\\r\\nSo next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early start.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 21</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nGoing Aboard\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was nearly six o\\'clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we drew\\r\\nnigh the wharf.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,\" said I to\\r\\nQueequeg, \"it can\\'t be shadows; she\\'s off by sunrise, I guess; come on!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Avast!\" cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close behind us,\\r\\nlaid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating himself between us,\\r\\nstood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight, strangely peering\\r\\nfrom Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Going aboard?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Hands off, will you,\" said I.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Lookee here,\" said Queequeg, shaking himself, \"go \\'way!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Aint going aboard, then?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Yes, we are,\" said I, \"but what business is that of yours?<br>\\r\\nDo you know, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"No, no, no; I wasn\\'t aware of that,\" said Elijah, slowly and wonderingly\\r\\nlooking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable glances.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Elijah,\" said I, \"you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We are\\r\\ngoing to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not to be detained.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Ye be, be ye?

Good-bye to ye. Shan\\'t see ye again\\r\\nvery soon, I guess; unless it\\'s before the Grand Jury.\" And with these cracked\\r\\nwords he finally departed, leaving me, for the moment, in no small wonderment\\r\\nat his frantic impudence.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound quiet,\\r\\nnot a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the hatches were all\\r\\non, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward to the forecastle, we\\r\\nfound the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a light, we went down, and found\\r\\nonly an old rigger there, wrapped in a tattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at\\r\\nwhole length upon two chests, his face downwards and inclosed in his folded\\r\\narms. The profoundest slumber slept upon him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?\" said I, looking\\r\\ndubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the wharf, Queequeg had\\r\\nnot at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I would have thought myself to\\r\\nhave been optically deceived in that matter, were it not for Elijah\\'s otherwise\\r\\ninexplicable question. But I beat the thing down; and again marking the\\r\\nsleeper, jocularly hinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the\\r\\nbody; telling him to establish himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the\\r\\nsleeper\\'s rear, as though feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more\\r\\nado, sat quietly down there.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Gracious! Queequeg, don\\'t sit there,\" said I.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Oh; perry dood seat,\" said Queequeg, \"my country way; won\\'t hurt him face.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Face!\" said I, \"call that his face? very benevolent countenance then;<br>\\r\\nbut how hard he breathes, he\\'s heaving himself; get off,<br>\\r\\nQueequeg, you are heavy, it\\'s grinding the face of the poor.<br>\\r\\nGet off, Queequeg! Look, he\\'ll twitch you off soon.<br>\\r\\nI wonder he don\\'t wake.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nQueequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and lighted\\r\\nhis tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing over the\\r\\nsleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning him in his broken\\r\\nfashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his land, owing to the absence\\r\\nof settees and sofas of all sorts, the king, chiefs, and great people\\r\\ngenerally, were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders for\\r\\nottomans; and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect, you had only to\\r\\nbuy up eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay them round in the piers and alcoves.\\r\\nBesides, it was very convenient on an excursion; much better than those\\r\\ngarden-chairs which are convertible into walking sticks; upon occasion, a chief\\r\\ncalling his attendant, and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a\\r\\nspreading tree, perhaps in some damp marshy place.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhile narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk from\\r\\nme, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper\\'s head.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What\\'s that for, Queequeg?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe which, it\\r\\nseemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed his soul, when we\\r\\nwere directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The strong vapor now completely\\r\\nfilling the contracted hole, it began to tell upon him. He breathed with a sort\\r\\nof muffledness; then seemed troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or\\r\\ntwice; then sat up and rubbed his eyes.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Holloa!\" he breathed at last, \"who be ye smokers?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Shipped men,\" answered I, \"when does she sail?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain came\\r\\naboard last night.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What Captain?\\xe2\\x80\\x94Ahab?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Who but him indeed?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we heard a\\r\\nnoise on deck.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Holloa! Starbuck\\'s astir,\" said the rigger. \"He\\'s a lively chief mate that;\\r\\ngood man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to.\" And so saying he\\r\\nwent on deck, and we followed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and threes; the\\r\\nriggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively engaged; and several of\\r\\nthe shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board. Meanwhile\\r\\nCaptain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 22</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMerry Christmas\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship\\'s riggers, and\\r\\nafter the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and after the\\r\\never-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with her last gift\\xe2\\x80\\x94 a\\r\\nnightcap for Stubb, the second mate, her brother-in-law, and a spare Bible for\\r\\nthe steward\\xe2\\x80\\x94after all this, the two Captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the\\r\\ncabin, and turning to the chief mate, Peleg said:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right?<br>\\r\\nCaptain Ahab is all ready\\xe2\\x80\\x94just spoke to him\\xe2\\x80\\x94nothing more<br>\\r\\nto be got from shore, eh?

Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain Peleg and\\r\\nCaptain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarter-deck, just as if\\r\\nthey were to be joint-commanders at sea, as well as to all appearances in port.\\r\\nAnd, as for Captain Ahab, no sign of him was yet to be seen; Only, they said he\\r\\nwas in the cabin. But then, the idea was, that his presence was by no means\\r\\nnecessary in getting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea.\\r\\nIndeed, as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot\\'s; and as he\\r\\nwas not yet completely recovered\\xe2\\x80\\x94so they said\\xe2\\x80\\x94therefore, Captain Ahab stayed\\r\\nbelow. And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the merchant\\r\\nservice many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time\\r\\nafter heaving up the anchor, but remain over the cabin table, having a farewell\\r\\nmerry-making with their shore friends, before they quit the ship for good with\\r\\nthe pilot.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain Peleg was\\r\\nnow all alive. He seemed to do most of the talking and commanding, and not\\r\\nBildad.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,\" he cried, as the sailors lingered at the\\r\\nmain-mast. \"Mr. Starbuck, drive aft.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Strike the tent there!\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94was the next order. As I hinted before, this whalebone\\r\\nmarquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the Pequod, for thirty\\r\\nyears, the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to\\r\\nheaving up the anchor.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!\\xe2\\x80\\x94jump!\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94was the next command, and the crew\\r\\nsprang for the handspikes.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot is the\\r\\nforward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be it known, in\\r\\naddition to his other offices, was one of the licensed pilots of the port\\xe2\\x80\\x94he\\r\\nbeing suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the Nantucket\\r\\npilot-fee to all the ships he was concerned in, for he never piloted any other\\r\\ncraft\\xe2\\x80\\x94Bildad, I say, might now be seen actively engaged in looking over the\\r\\nbows for the approaching anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal\\r\\nstave of psalmody, to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some\\r\\nsort of a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good will.\\r\\nNevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that no profane\\r\\nsongs would be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in getting under\\r\\nweigh; and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each\\r\\nseaman\\'s berth.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMeantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped and swore\\r\\nastern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he would sink the ship\\r\\nbefore the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I paused on my handspike, and\\r\\ntold Queequeg to do the same, thinking of the perils we both ran, in starting\\r\\non the voyage with such a devil for a pilot. I was comforting myself, however,\\r\\nwith the thought that in pious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of\\r\\nhis seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in\\r\\nmy rear, and turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in\\r\\nthe act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my first\\r\\nkick.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?\" he roared. \"Spring, thou\\r\\nsheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why don\\'t ye spring, I say, all of\\r\\nye\\xe2\\x80\\x94spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red whiskers; spring there,\\r\\nScotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I say, all of ye, and spring your\\r\\neyes out!\" And so saying, he moved along the windlass, here and there using his\\r\\nleg very freely, while imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody.\\r\\nThinks I, Captain Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It was a\\r\\nshort, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged into night, we\\r\\nfound ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose freezing spray cased\\r\\nus in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of teeth on the bulwarks\\r\\nglistened in the moonlight; and like the white ivory tusks of some huge\\r\\nelephant, vast curving icicles depended from the bows.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as the old\\r\\ncraft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering frost all over\\r\\nher, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his steady notes were heard,\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\"Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood,<br>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0Stand dressed in living green.<br>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0So to the Jews old Canaan stood,<br>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0While Jordan rolled between.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNever did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then.

I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man, who in\\r\\nmid-winter just landed from a four years\\' dangerous voyage, could so\\r\\nunrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term. The land seemed\\r\\nscorching to his feet. Wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable; deep\\r\\nmemories yield no epitaphs; this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of\\r\\nBulkington. Let me only say that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed\\r\\nship, that miserably drives along the leeward land. The port would fain give\\r\\nsuccor; the port is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort, hearthstone,\\r\\nsupper, warm blankets, friends, all that\\'s kind to our mortalities. But in that\\r\\ngale, the port, the land, is that ship\\'s direst jeopardy; she must fly all\\r\\nhospitality; one touch of land, though it but graze the keel, would make her\\r\\nshudder through and through. With all her might she crowds all sail off shore;\\r\\nin so doing, fights \\'gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward;\\r\\nseeks all the lashed sea\\'s landlessness again; for refuge\\'s sake forlornly\\r\\nrushing into peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nKnow ye now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally\\r\\nintolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort\\r\\nof the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the wildest winds\\r\\nof heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous, slavish shore?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut as in landlessness alone resides the highest truth, shoreless, indefinite\\r\\nas God\\xe2\\x80\\x94so better is it to perish in that howling infinite, than be ingloriously\\r\\ndashed upon the lee, even if that were safety!

If a stranger were introduced\\r\\ninto any miscellaneous metropolitan society, it would but slightly advance the\\r\\ngeneral opinion of his merits, were he presented to the company as a\\r\\nharpooneer, say; and if in emulation of the naval officers he should append the\\r\\ninitials S.W.F. (Sperm Whale Fishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure\\r\\nwould be deemed preeminently presuming and ridiculous.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDoubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us whalemen, is\\r\\nthis: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of\\r\\nbusiness; and that when actively engaged therein, we are surrounded by all\\r\\nmanner of defilements. Butchers we are, that is true. But butchers, also, and\\r\\nbutchers of the bloodiest badge have been all Martial Commanders whom the world\\r\\ninvariably delights to honor. And as for the matter of the alleged\\r\\nuncleanliness of our business, ye shall soon be initiated into certain facts\\r\\nhitherto pretty generally unknown, and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly\\r\\nplant the sperm whale-ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy\\r\\nearth. But even granting the charge in question to be true; what disordered\\r\\nslippery decks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of\\r\\nthose battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies\\'\\r\\nplaudits? And if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the\\r\\nsoldier\\'s profession; let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely\\r\\nmarched up to a battery, would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm\\r\\nwhale\\'s vast tail, fanning into eddies the air over his head. For what are the\\r\\ncomprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders\\r\\nof God!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it unwittingly pay\\r\\nus the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding adoration! for almost all the\\r\\ntapers, lamps, and candles that burn round the globe, burn, as before so many\\r\\nshrines, to our glory!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of scales; see\\r\\nwhat we whalemen are, and have been.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhy did the Dutch in De Witt\\'s time have admirals of their whaling fleets? Why\\r\\ndid Louis XVI of France, at his own personal expense, fit out whaling ships\\r\\nfrom Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some score or two of families\\r\\nfrom our own island of Nantucket? Why did Britain between the years 1750 and\\r\\n1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of 1,000,000 pounds? And lastly,\\r\\nhow comes it that we whalemen of America now outnumber all the rest of the\\r\\nbanded whalemen in the world; sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels;\\r\\nmanned by eighteen thousand men; yearly consuming 00824,000,000 of dollars; the\\r\\nships worth, at the time of sailing, 20,000,000 dollars; and every year\\r\\nimporting into our harbors a well reaped harvest of 00847,000,000 dollars. How\\r\\ncomes all this, if there be not something puissant in whaling?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut this is not the half; look again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life, point\\r\\nout one single peaceful influence, which within the last sixty years has\\r\\noperated more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken in one aggregate,\\r\\nthan the high and mighty business of whaling. One way and another, it has\\r\\nbegotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so continuously momentous in\\r\\ntheir sequential issues, that whaling may well be regarded as that Egyptian\\r\\nmother, who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her womb. It would be a\\r\\nhopeless, endless task to catalogue all these things. Let a handful suffice.\\r\\nFor many years past the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the\\r\\nremotest and least known parts of the earth. She has explored seas and\\r\\narchipelagoes which had no chart, where no Cooke or Vancouver had ever sailed.\\r\\nIf American and European men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage harbors,\\r\\nlet them fire salutes to the honor and glory of the whale-ship, which\\r\\noriginally showed them the way, and first interpreted between them and the\\r\\nsavages. They may celebrate as they will the heroes of Exploring Expeditions,\\r\\nyour Cookes, Your Krusensterns; but I say that scores of anonymous Captains\\r\\nhave sailed out of Nantucket, that were as great, and greater, than your Cooke\\r\\nand your Krusenstern. For in their succorless empty-handedness, they, in the\\r\\nheathenish sharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands,\\r\\nbattled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cooke with all his marines and\\r\\nmuskets would not willingly have willingly dared. All that is made such a\\r\\nflourish of in the old South Sea Voyages, those things were but the life-time\\r\\ncommonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers. Often, adventures which Vancouver\\r\\ndedicates three chapters to, these men accounted unworthy of being set down in\\r\\nthe ship\\'s common log. Ah, the world! Oh, the world!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nUntil the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial, scarcely\\r\\nany intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe and the long line\\r\\nof the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast. It was the whalemen who\\r\\nfirst broke through the jealous policy of the Spanish crown, touching those\\r\\ncolonies; and, if space permitted, it might be distinctly shown how from those\\r\\nwhalemen at last eventuated the liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the\\r\\nyoke of Old Spain, and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those\\r\\nparts.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThat great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was given to the\\r\\nenlightened world by the whaleman. After its first blunder-born discovery by a\\r\\nDutchman, all other ships, long shunned those shores as pestiferously\\r\\nbarbarous; but the whale-ship touched there. The whale-ship is the true mother\\r\\nof that now mighty colony. Moreover, in the infancy of the first Australian\\r\\nsettlement, the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the\\r\\nbenevolent biscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their\\r\\nwaters. The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do\\r\\ncommercial homage to the whale-ship, that cleared the way for the missionary\\r\\nand the merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their\\r\\nfirst destinations. If that double-bolted land, Japan, is ever to become\\r\\nhospitable, it is the whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due; for\\r\\nalready she is on the threshold.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no\\r\\naesthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I ready to shiver\\r\\nfifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a split helmet every time.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you will say.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe whale no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler? Who wrote the\\r\\nfirst account of our Leviathan? Who but mighty Job? And who composed the first\\r\\nnarrative of a whaling-voyage? Who, but no less a prince than Alfred the Great,\\r\\nwho, with his own royal pen, took down the words from Other, the Norwegian\\r\\nwhale-hunter of those times! And who pronounced our glowing eulogy in\\r\\nParliament? Who, but Edmund Burke!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTrue enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have no good\\r\\nblood in their veins.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNo good blood in their veins? They have something better than royal blood\\r\\nthere. The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel; afterwards, by\\r\\nmarriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of Nantucket, and the ancestress\\r\\nto a long line of Folgers and harpooneers\\xe2\\x80\\x94all kith and kin to noble Benjamin\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\nthis day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nGood again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhaling not respectable? Whaling is imperial! By old English statutory law, the\\r\\nwhale is declared \"a royal fish.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOh, that\\'s only nominal!

He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy coast, seemed\\r\\nwell adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard as twice-baked\\r\\nbiscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood would not spoil like bottled\\r\\nale. He must have been born in some time of general drought and famine, or upon\\r\\none of those fast days for which his state is famous. Only some thirty arid\\r\\nsummers had he seen; those summers had dried up all his physical\\r\\nsuperfluousness. But this, his thinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token\\r\\nof wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily\\r\\nblight. It was merely the condensation of the man. He was by no means\\r\\nill-looking; quite the contrary. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and\\r\\nclosely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength, like a\\r\\nrevivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to\\r\\ncome, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like a\\r\\npatent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all\\r\\nclimates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet lingering\\r\\nimages of those thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted through life. A\\r\\nstaid, steadfast man, whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of\\r\\naction, and not a tame chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and\\r\\nfortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times affected, and in\\r\\nsome cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly\\r\\nconscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence, the wild\\r\\nwatery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to\\r\\nsuperstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some organizations\\r\\nseems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance. Outward\\r\\nportents and inward presentiments were his. And if at times these things bent\\r\\nthe welded iron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic memories of\\r\\nhis young Cape wife and child, tend to bend him still more from the original\\r\\nruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to those latent influences\\r\\nwhich, in some honest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so\\r\\noften evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. \"I\\r\\nwill have no man in my boat,\" said Starbuck, \"who is not afraid of a whale.\" By\\r\\nthis, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage was\\r\\nthat which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that\\r\\nan utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Aye, aye,\" said Stubb, the second mate, \"Starbuck, there, is as careful a man\\r\\nas you\\'ll find anywhere in this fishery.\" But we shall ere long see what that\\r\\nword \"careful\" precisely means when used by a man like Stubb, or almost any\\r\\nother whale hunter.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nStarbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a sentiment; but\\r\\na thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all mortally practical\\r\\noccasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in this business of whaling,\\r\\ncourage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship, like her beef and her\\r\\nbread, and not to be foolishly wasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering\\r\\nfor whales after sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much\\r\\npersisted in fighting him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical\\r\\nocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for theirs;\\r\\nand that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew. What doom was\\r\\nhis own father\\'s? Where, in the bottomless deeps, could he find the torn limbs\\r\\nof his brother?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWith memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain\\r\\nsuperstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck, which could,\\r\\nnevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But it was not in\\r\\nreasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such terrible experiences\\r\\nand remembrances as he had; it was not in nature that these things should fail\\r\\nin latently engendering an element in him, which, under suitable circumstances,\\r\\nwould break out from its confinement, and burn all his courage up. And brave as\\r\\nhe might be, it was that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men,\\r\\nwhich, while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or\\r\\nwhales, or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet cannot\\r\\nwithstand those more terrific, because more spiritual terrors, which sometimes\\r\\nmenace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete abasement\\r\\nof poor Starbuck\\'s fortitude, scarce might I have the heart to write it; for it\\r\\nis a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose the fall of valor in the\\r\\nsoul. Men may seem detestable as joint stock-companies and nations; knaves,\\r\\nfools, and murderers there may be; men may have mean and meagre faces; but,\\r\\nman, in the ideal, is so noble and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing\\r\\ncreature, that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run\\r\\nto throw their costliest robes. That immaculate manliness we feel within\\r\\nourselves, so far within us, that it remains intact though all the outer\\r\\ncharacter seem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a\\r\\nvalor-ruined man. Nor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight, completely\\r\\nstifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars. But this august dignity I\\r\\ntreat of, is not the dignity of kings and robes, but that abounding dignity\\r\\nwhich has no robed investiture. Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that\\r\\nwields a pick or drives a spike; that democratic dignity which, on all hands,\\r\\nradiates without end from God; Himself! The great God absolute! The centre and\\r\\ncircumference of all democracy! His omnipresence, our divine equality!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIf, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall hereafter\\r\\nascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them tragic graces; if even\\r\\nthe most mournful, perchance the most abased, among them all, shall at times\\r\\nlift himself to the exalted mounts; if I shall touch that workman\\'s arm with\\r\\nsome ethereal light; if I shall spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of\\r\\nsun; then against all mortal critics bear me out in it, thou just Spirit of\\r\\nEquality, which hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind! Bear\\r\\nme out in it, thou great democratic God! who didst not refuse to the swart\\r\\nconvict, Bunyan, the pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe with doubly\\r\\nhammered leaves of finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes;\\r\\nThou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon\\r\\na war-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a throne! Thou who, in all Thy\\r\\nmighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest Thy selectest champions from the kingly\\r\\ncommoners; bear me out in it, O God!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 27</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nKnights and Squires\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nStubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence, according to\\r\\nlocal usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky; neither craven nor\\r\\nvaliant; taking perils as they came with an indifferent air; and while engaged\\r\\nin the most imminent crisis of the chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a\\r\\njourneyman joiner engaged for the year. Good-humored, easy, and careless, he\\r\\npresided over his whaleboat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner,\\r\\nand his crew all invited guests. He was as particular about the comfortable\\r\\narrangements of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about the\\r\\nsnugness of his box. When close to the whale, in the very death-lock of the\\r\\nfight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly, as a whistling\\r\\ntinker his hammer. He would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and\\r\\nflank with the most exasperated monster. Long usage had, for this Stubb,\\r\\nconverted the jaws of death into an easy chair. What he thought of death\\r\\nitself, there is no telling. Whether he ever thought of it at all, might be a\\r\\nquestion; but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a\\r\\ncomfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a sort of\\r\\ncall of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there, about something\\r\\nwhich he would find out when he obeyed the order, and not sooner.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhat, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going, unfearing man,\\r\\nso cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave\\r\\npeddlers, all bowed to the ground with their packs; what helped to bring about\\r\\nthat almost impious good-humor of his; that thing must have been his pipe. For,\\r\\nlike his nose, his short, black little pipe was one of the regular features of\\r\\nhis face. You would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk\\r\\nwithout his nose as without his pipe. He kept a whole row of pipes there ready\\r\\nloaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever he turned\\r\\nin, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from the other to the\\r\\nend of the chapter; then loading them again to be in readiness anew. For, when\\r\\nStubb dressed, instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers, he put his\\r\\npipe into his mouth.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least of his peculiar\\r\\ndisposition; for every one knows that this earthly air, whether ashore or\\r\\nafloat, is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless\\r\\nmortals who have died exhaling it; and as in time of the cholera, some people\\r\\ngo about with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against\\r\\nall mortal tribulations, Stubb\\'s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of\\r\\ndisinfecting agent.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha\\'s Vineyard. A short,\\r\\nstout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales, who somehow\\r\\nseemed to think that the great Leviathans had personally and hereditarily\\r\\naffronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of honor with him, to\\r\\ndestroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost was he to all sense of\\r\\nreverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways; and so\\r\\ndead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering\\r\\nthem; that in his poor opinion, the wondrous whale was but a species of\\r\\nmagnified mouse, or at least water-rat, requiring only a little circumvention\\r\\nand some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. This\\r\\nignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the\\r\\nmatter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a three years\\'\\r\\nvoyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time.\\r\\nAs a carpenter\\'s nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails; so mankind\\r\\nmay be similarly divided. Little Flask was one of the wrought ones; made to\\r\\nclinch tight and last long. They called him King-Post on board of the Pequod;\\r\\nbecause, in form, he could be well likened to the short, square timber known by\\r\\nthat name in Arctic whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side\\r\\ntimbers inserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions\\r\\nof those battering seas.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow these three mates\\xe2\\x80\\x94Starbuck, Stubb and Flask, were momentous men. They it\\r\\nwas who by universal prescription commanded three of the Pequod\\'s boats as\\r\\nheadsmen. In that grand order of battle in which Captain Ahab would probably\\r\\nmarshal his forces to descend on the whales, these three headsmen were as\\r\\ncaptains of companies. Or, being armed with their long keen whaling spears,\\r\\nthey were as a picked trio of lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of\\r\\njavelins.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic Knight\\r\\nof old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer, who in certain\\r\\nconjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the former one has been\\r\\nbadly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and moreover, as there generally\\r\\nsubsists between the two, a close intimacy and friendliness; it is therefore\\r\\nbut meet, that in this place we set down who the Pequod\\'s harpooneers were, and\\r\\nto what headsman each of them belonged.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFirst of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected for his\\r\\nsquire. But Queequeg is already known.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNext was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly\\r\\npromontory of Martha\\'s Vineyard, where there still exists the last remnant of a\\r\\nvillage of red men, which has long supplied the neighboring island of Nantucket\\r\\nwith many of her most daring harpooneers. In the fishery, they usually go by\\r\\nthe generic name of Gay-Headers. Tashtego\\'s long, lean, sable hair, his high\\r\\ncheek bones, and black rounding eyes\\xe2\\x80\\x94for an Indian, Oriental in their\\r\\nlargeness, but Antarctic in their glittering expression\\xe2\\x80\\x94all this sufficiently\\r\\nproclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior\\r\\nhunters, who, in quest of the great New England moose, had scoured, bow in\\r\\nhand, the aboriginal forests of the main. But no longer snuffing in the trail\\r\\nof the wild beasts of the woodland, Tashtego now hunted in the wake of the\\r\\ngreat whales of the sea; the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the\\r\\ninfallible arrow of the sires. To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky\\r\\nlimbs, you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier\\r\\nPuritans and half-believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the\\r\\nPowers of the Air. Tashtego was Stubb the second mate\\'s squire.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThird among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black negro-savage,\\r\\nwith a lion-like tread\\xe2\\x80\\x94an Ahasuerus to behold. Suspended from his ears were two\\r\\ngolden hoops, so large that the sailors called them ringbolts, and would talk\\r\\nof securing the top-sail halyards to them. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily\\r\\nshipped on board of a whaler, lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And\\r\\nnever having been anywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan\\r\\nharbors most frequented by the whalemen; and having now led for many years the\\r\\nbold life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what\\r\\nmanner of men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect\\r\\nas a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his\\r\\nsocks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and a white man\\r\\nstanding before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress.\\r\\nCurious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus Daggoo, was the Squire of\\r\\nlittle Flask, who looked like a chess-man beside him. As for the residue of the\\r\\nPequod\\'s company, be it said, that at the present day not one in two of the\\r\\nmany thousand men before the mast employed in the American whale fishery, are\\r\\nAmericans born, though pretty nearly all the officers are. Herein it is the\\r\\nsame with the American whale fishery as with the American army and military and\\r\\nmerchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the construction of the\\r\\nAmerican Canals and Railroads. The same, I say, because in all these cases the\\r\\nnative American literally provides the brains, the rest of the world as\\r\\ngenerously supplying the muscles. No small number of these whaling seamen\\r\\nbelong to the Azores, where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently\\r\\ntouch to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In\\r\\nlike manner, the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the\\r\\nShetland Islands, to receive the full complement of their crew. Upon the\\r\\npassage homewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no telling,\\r\\nbut Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly all Islanders in\\r\\nthe Pequod, Isolatoes too, I call such, not acknowledging the common continent\\r\\nof men, but each Isolato living on a separate continent of his own. Yet now,\\r\\nfederated along one keel, what a set these Isolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz\\r\\ndeputation from all the isles of the sea, and all the ends of the earth,\\r\\naccompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the world\\'s grievances before that\\r\\nbar from which not very many of them ever come back. Black Little Pip\\xe2\\x80\\x94 he never\\r\\ndid\\xe2\\x80\\x94oh, no! he went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim Pequod\\'s forecastle,\\r\\nye shall ere long see him, beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal\\r\\ntime, when sent for, to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in\\r\\nwith angels, and beat his tambourine in glory; called a coward here, hailed a\\r\\nhero there!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 28</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAhab\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was seen of\\r\\nCaptain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches, and for\\r\\naught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed to be the only commanders\\r\\nof the ship; only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden\\r\\nand peremptory, that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously.\\r\\nYes, their supreme lord and dictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any\\r\\neyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEvery time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly gazed aft\\r\\nto mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague disquietude\\r\\ntouching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the sea became almost a\\r\\nperturbation. This was strangely heightened at times by the ragged Elijah\\'s\\r\\ndiabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me, with a subtle energy I\\r\\ncould not have before conceived of. But poorly could I withstand them, much as\\r\\nin other moods I was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that\\r\\noutlandish prophet of the wharves. But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or\\r\\nuneasiness\\xe2\\x80\\x94to call it so\\xe2\\x80\\x94 which I felt, yet whenever I came to look about me in\\r\\nthe ship, it seemed against all warranty to cherish such emotions. For though\\r\\nthe harpooneers, with the great body of the crew, were a far more barbaric,\\r\\nheathenish, and motley set than any of the tame merchant-ship companies which\\r\\nmy previous experiences had made me acquainted with, still I ascribed this\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\r\\nrightly ascribed it\\xe2\\x80\\x94to the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild\\r\\nScandinavian vocation in which I had so abandonedly embarked. But it was\\r\\nespecially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which\\r\\nwas most forcibly calculated to allay these colorless misgivings, and induce\\r\\nconfidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage. Three better,\\r\\nmore likely sea-officers and men, each in his own different way, could not\\r\\nreadily be found, and they were every one of them Americans; a Nantucketer, a\\r\\nVineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it being Christmas when the ship shot from out her\\r\\nharbor, for a space we had biting Polar weather, though all the time running\\r\\naway from it to the southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which\\r\\nwe sailed, gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable\\r\\nweather behind us. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey and gloomy\\r\\nenough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the ship was rushing\\r\\nthrough the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity,\\r\\nthat as I mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch, so soon as I\\r\\nlevelled my glance towards the taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me.\\r\\nReality outran apprehension; Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the recovery\\r\\nfrom any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when the fire has\\r\\noverrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them, or taking away one\\r\\nparticle from their compacted aged robustness. His whole high, broad form,\\r\\nseemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an unalterable mould, like Cellini\\'s\\r\\ncast Perseus. Threading its way out from among his grey hairs, and continuing\\r\\nright down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in\\r\\nhis clothing, you saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled\\r\\nthat perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a great\\r\\ntree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and without wrenching a\\r\\nsingle twig, peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom ere running off\\r\\ninto the soil, leaving the tree still greenly alive, but branded. Whether that\\r\\nmark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some desperate\\r\\nwound, no one could certainly say. By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage\\r\\nlittle or no allusion was made to it, especially by the mates. But once\\r\\nTashtego\\'s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew, superstitiously\\r\\nasserted that not till he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way\\r\\nbranded, and then it came upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in\\r\\nan elemental strife at sea. Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived,\\r\\nby what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man, who, having never\\r\\nbefore sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab.\\r\\nNevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly\\r\\ninvested this old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. So that no\\r\\nwhite sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab\\r\\nshould be tranquilly laid out\\xe2\\x80\\x94 which might hardly come to pass, so he\\r\\nmuttered\\xe2\\x80\\x94then, whoever should do that last office for the dead, would find a\\r\\nbirth-mark on him from crown to sole.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the livid brand\\r\\nwhich streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly noted that not a\\r\\nlittle of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon\\r\\nwhich he partly stood. It had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at\\r\\nsea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whale\\'s jaw. \"Aye, he\\r\\nwas dismasted off Japan,\" said the old Gay-Head Indian once; \"but like his\\r\\ndismasted craft, he shipped another mast without coming home for it. He has a\\r\\nquiver of \\'em.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of the\\r\\nPequod\\'s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds, there was an\\r\\nauger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the plank. His bone leg\\r\\nsteadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab\\r\\nstood erect, looking straight out beyond the ship\\'s ever-pitching prow. There\\r\\nwas an infinity of firmest fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable\\r\\nwilfulness, in the fixed and fearless, forward dedication of that glance. Not a\\r\\nword he spoke; nor did his officers say aught to him; though by all their\\r\\nminutest gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not\\r\\npainful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not only that,\\r\\nbut moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face; in\\r\\nall the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEre long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin. But\\r\\nafter that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either standing in\\r\\nhis pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or heavily walking the\\r\\ndeck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to grow a little genial, he\\r\\nbecame still less and less a recluse; as if, when the ship had sailed from\\r\\nhome, nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so\\r\\nsecluded. And, by and by, it came to pass, that he was almost continually in\\r\\nthe air; but, as yet, for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last\\r\\nsunny deck, he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the Pequod was\\r\\nonly making a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling\\r\\npreparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so that\\r\\nthere was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite Ahab, now; and\\r\\nthus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that layer upon layer were\\r\\npiled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile\\r\\nthemselves upon.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant,\\r\\nholiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him from his mood. For,\\r\\nas when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and May, trip home to the wintry,\\r\\nmisanthropic woods; even the barest, ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak\\r\\nwill at least send forth some few green sprouts, to welcome such gladhearted\\r\\nvisitants; so Ahab did, in the end, a little respond to the playful allurings\\r\\nof that girlish air. More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a\\r\\nlook, which, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 29</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEnter Ahab; to Him, Stubb\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSome days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went rolling\\r\\nthrough the bright Quito spring, which at sea, almost perpetually reigns on the\\r\\nthreshold of the eternal August of the Tropic. The warmly cool, clear, ringing\\r\\nperfumed, overflowing, redundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian\\r\\nsherbet, heaped up\\xe2\\x80\\x94 flaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred and stately\\r\\nnights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely\\r\\npride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted suns!\\r\\nFor sleeping man, \\'twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such\\r\\nseducing nights. But all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely\\r\\nlend new spells and potencies to the outward world. Inward they turned upon the\\r\\nsoul, especially when the still mild hours of eve came on; then, memory shot\\r\\nher crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights. And all these\\r\\nsubtle agencies, more and more they wrought on Ahab\\'s texture.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOld age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less man has\\r\\nto do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders, the old\\r\\ngreybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night-cloaked deck. It\\r\\nwas so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he seemed so much to live in the open\\r\\nair, that truly speaking, his visits were more to the cabin, than from the\\r\\ncabin to the planks. \"It feels like going down into one\\'s tomb,\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94he would\\r\\nmutter to himself\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"for an old captain like me to be descending this narrow\\r\\nscuttle, to go to my grave-dug berth.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were set, and\\r\\nthe band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below; and when if a rope\\r\\nwas to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors flung it not rudely down, as\\r\\nby day, but with some cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing\\r\\ntheir slumbering shipmates; when this sort of steady quietude would begin to\\r\\nprevail, habitually, the silent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle; and\\r\\nere long the old man would emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his\\r\\ncrippled way. Some considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like\\r\\nthese, he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his\\r\\nwearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such would\\r\\nhave been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that their dreams\\r\\nwould have been of the crunching teeth of sharks. But once, the mood was on him\\r\\ntoo deep for common regardings; and as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was\\r\\nmeasuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate, came\\r\\nup from below, and with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted\\r\\nthat if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say\\r\\nnay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting something\\r\\nindistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the insertion into it,\\r\\nof the ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know Ahab then.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb,\" said Ahab, \"that thou wouldst wad me that fashion?\\r\\nBut go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave; where such as ye\\r\\nsleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at last.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Down, dog, and\\r\\nkennel!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nStarting at the unforeseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful\\r\\nold man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly, \"I am not used to\\r\\nbe spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half like it, sir.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Avast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away, as if to\\r\\navoid some passionate temptation.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"No, sir; not yet,\" said Stubb, emboldened, \"I will not tamely be called a dog,\\r\\nsir.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and begone, or I\\'ll\\r\\nclear the world of thee!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in his\\r\\naspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,\" muttered\\r\\nStubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle. \"It\\'s very queer.\\r\\nStop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don\\'t well know whether to go back and strike him,\\r\\nor\\xe2\\x80\\x94what\\'s that?\\xe2\\x80\\x94 down here on my knees and pray for him? Yes, that was the\\r\\nthought coming up in me; but it would be the first time I ever did pray. It\\'s\\r\\nqueer; very queer; and he\\'s queer too; aye, take him fore and aft, he\\'s about\\r\\nthe queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with. How he flashed at me!\\xe2\\x80\\x94his eyes\\r\\nlike powder-pans! is he mad! Anyway there\\'s something\\'s on his mind, as sure as\\r\\nthere must be something on a deck when it cracks.

A hot old man! I guess\\r\\nhe\\'s got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it\\'s a kind of Tic-Dolly-row\\r\\nthey say\\xe2\\x80\\x94 worse nor a toothache. Well, well; I don\\'t know what it is, but the\\r\\nLord keep me from catching it. He\\'s full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into\\r\\nthe after hold for, every night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what\\'s that\\r\\nfor, I should like to know? Who\\'s made appointments with him in the hold? Ain\\'t\\r\\nthat queer, now? But there\\'s no telling, it\\'s the old game\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Here goes for a\\r\\nsnooze.

Think not, is my\\r\\neleventh commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth\\xe2\\x80\\x94So here goes again.\\r\\nBut how\\'s that? didn\\'t he call me a dog? blazes! he called me ten times a\\r\\ndonkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of that! He might as well have\\r\\nkicked me, and done with it. Maybe he did kick me, and I didn\\'t observe it, I\\r\\nwas so taken all aback with his brow, somehow. It flashed like a bleached bone.\\r\\nWhat the devil\\'s the matter with me? I don\\'t stand right on my legs. Coming\\r\\nafoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out.

You know the old man\\'s ivory leg,\\r\\nwell I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick back, upon my\\r\\nsoul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then, presto! Ahab seemed a\\r\\npyramid, and I like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. But what was still more\\r\\ncurious, Flask\\xe2\\x80\\x94you know how curious all dreams are\\xe2\\x80\\x94through all this rage that I\\r\\nwas in, I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not\\r\\nmuch of an insult, that kick from Ahab. \\'Why,\\' thinks I, \\'what\\'s the row? It\\'s\\r\\nnot a real leg, only a false one.\\' And there\\'s a mighty difference between a\\r\\nliving thump and a dead thump. That\\'s what makes a blow from the hand, Flask,\\r\\nfifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane. The living member\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\nthat makes the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to myself all the\\r\\nwhile, mind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid\\xe2\\x80\\x94so\\r\\nconfoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I say, I was thinking to\\r\\nmyself, \\'what\\'s his leg now, but a cane-. a whale-bone cane. Yes,\\' thinks I,\\r\\n\\'it was only a playful cudgelling\\xe2\\x80\\x94in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\nnot a base kick. Besides,\\' thinks I, \\'look at it once; why, the end of it\\xe2\\x80\\x94the\\r\\nfoot part\\xe2\\x80\\x94what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer\\r\\nkicked me, there\\'s a devilish broad insult. But this insult is whittled down to\\r\\na point only.\\' But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask. While I was\\r\\nbattering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired old merman, with a hump\\r\\non his back, takes me by the shoulders, and slews me round. \\'What are you\\r\\n\\'bout?\\' says he. Slid! man, but I was frightened. Such a phiz! But, somehow,\\r\\nnext moment I was over the fright. \\'What am I about?\\' says I at last. \\'And what\\r\\nbusiness is that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do you want a\\r\\nkick?\\' By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned round his\\r\\nstern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a\\r\\nclout\\xe2\\x80\\x94what do you think, I saw?\\xe2\\x80\\x94why thunder alive, man, his stern was stuck\\r\\nfull of marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I on second thought, \\'I guess I\\r\\nwon\\'t kick you, old fellow.\\' \\'Wise Stubb,\\' said he, \\'wise Stubb;\\' and kept\\r\\nmuttering it all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag.\\r\\nSeeing he wasn\\'t going to stop saying over his \\'wise Stubb, wise Stubb,\\' I\\r\\nthought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I had only just\\r\\nlifted my foot for it, when he roared out, \\'Stop that kicking!\\' \\'Halloa,\\' says\\r\\nI, \\'what\\'s the matter now, old fellow?\\' \\'Look ye here,\\' says he; \\'let\\'s argue\\r\\nthe insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn\\'t he?\\' \\'Yes, he did,\\' says I\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\'right\\r\\nhere it was.\\' \\'Very good,\\' says he\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\'he used his ivory leg, didn\\'t he?\\' \\'Yes, he\\r\\ndid,\\' says I. \\'Well then,\\' says he, \\'wise Stubb, what have you to complain of?\\r\\nDidn\\'t he kick with right good will? it wasn\\'t a common pitch pine leg he\\r\\nkicked with, was it? No, you were kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful\\r\\nivory leg, Stubb. It\\'s an honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In\\r\\nold England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen,\\r\\nand made garter-knights of; but, be your boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked by\\r\\nold Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; be kicked by him;\\r\\naccount his kicks honors; and on no account kick back; for you can\\'t help\\r\\nyourself, wise Stubb. Don\\'t you see that pyramid?\\' With that, he all of a\\r\\nsudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to swim off into the air. I\\r\\nsnored; rolled over; and there I was in my hammock! Now, what do you think of\\r\\nthat dream, Flask?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.\\'\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"May be; may be. But it\\'s made a wise man of me, Flask. D\\'ye see Ahab standing\\r\\nthere, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best thing you can do, Flask,\\r\\nis to let the old man alone; never speak to him, whatever he says. Halloa!\\r\\nWhat\\'s that he shouts? Hark!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Mast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye!

Ere that come to pass; ere the Pequod\\'s weedy\\r\\nhull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the leviathan; at the\\r\\noutset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough\\r\\nappreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations and\\r\\nallusions of all sorts which are to follow.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera, that I\\r\\nwould now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy task. The classification of\\r\\nthe constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here essayed. Listen to what the\\r\\nbest and latest authorities have laid down.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled Cetology,\"\\r\\nsays Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry as to\\r\\nthe true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families\\xe2\\x80\\xa6.

Nevertheless, though of real knowledge there be\\r\\nlittle, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in some small degree, with\\r\\ncetology, or the science of whales. Many are the men, small and great, old and\\r\\nnew, landsmen and seamen, who have at large or in little, written of the whale.\\r\\nRun over a few:\\xe2\\x80\\x94 The Authors of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir\\r\\nThomas Browne; Gesner; Ray; Linnaeus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi;\\r\\nSibbald; Brisson; Marten; Lacepede; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier;\\r\\nFrederick Cuvier; John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne;\\r\\nthe Author of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to what\\r\\nultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above cited extracts\\r\\nwill show.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf the names in this list of whale authors only those following Owen ever saw\\r\\nliving whales; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and\\r\\nwhaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate subject of the Greenland or\\r\\nright-whale, he is the best existing authority. But Scoresby knew nothing and\\r\\nsays nothing of the great sperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale\\r\\nis almost unworthy mentioning. And here be it said, that the Greenland whale is\\r\\nan usurper upon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means the largest\\r\\nof the whales. Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the profound\\r\\nignorance which till some seventy years back, invested the then fabulous and\\r\\nutterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to this present day still\\r\\nreigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation\\r\\nhas been every way complete. Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions\\r\\nin the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale,\\r\\nwithout one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has at\\r\\nlast come for a new proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good people\\r\\nall,\\xe2\\x80\\x94the Greenland whale is deposed,\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the great sperm whale now reigneth!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm\\r\\nwhale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest degree succeed in the\\r\\nattempt. Those books are Beale\\'s and Bennett\\'s; both in their time surgeons to\\r\\nthe English South-Sea whale-ships, and both exact and reliable men. The\\r\\noriginal matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is\\r\\nnecessarily small; but so far as it goes, it is of excellent quality, though\\r\\nmostly confined to scientific description. As yet, however, the sperm whale,\\r\\nscientific or poetic, lives not complete in any literature. Far above all other\\r\\nhunted whales, his is an unwritten life.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive\\r\\nclassification, if only an easy outline one for the present, hereafter to be\\r\\nfilled in all-outward its departments by subsequent laborers. As no better man\\r\\nadvances to take this matter in hand, I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I\\r\\npromise nothing complete; because any human thing supposed to be complete must\\r\\nfor that very reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not pretend to a minute\\r\\nanatomical description of the various species, or\\xe2\\x80\\x94in this space at least\\xe2\\x80\\x94 to\\r\\nmuch of any description. My object here is simply to project the draught of a\\r\\nsystematization of cetology. I am the architect, not the builder.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the Post-Office is\\r\\nequal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them; to have one\\'s\\r\\nhands among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very pelvis of the world;\\r\\nthis is a fearful thing. What am I that I should essay to hook the nose of this\\r\\nleviathan! The awful tauntings in Job might well appal me. \"Will he (the\\r\\nleviathan) make a covenant with thee? Behold the hope of him is vain! But I\\r\\nhave swam through libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do with\\r\\nwhales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There are\\r\\nsome preliminaries to settle.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFirst: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology is in the\\r\\nvery vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it still remains a\\r\\nmoot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of Nature, A.D. 1776,\\r\\nLinnaeus declares, \"I hereby separate the whales from the fish.\" But of my own\\r\\nknowledge, I know that down to the year 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and\\r\\nherring, against Linnaeus\\'s express edict, were still found dividing the\\r\\npossession of the same seas with the Leviathan.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from the\\r\\nwaters, he states as follows: \"On account of their warm bilocular heart, their\\r\\nlungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem intrantem feminam mammis\\r\\nlactantem,\" and finally, \"ex lege naturae jure meritoque.\" I submitted all this\\r\\nto my friends Simeon Macey and Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of\\r\\nmine in a certain voyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons set\\r\\nforth were altogether insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBe it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned ground\\r\\nthat the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me. This fundamental\\r\\nthing settled, the next point is, in what internal respect does the whale\\r\\ndiffer from other fish. Above, Linnaeus has given you those items. But in brief\\r\\nthey are these: lungs and warm blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and\\r\\ncold blooded.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNext: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\\r\\nconspicuously to label him for all time to come. To be short, then, a whale is\\r\\na spouting fish with a horizontal tail. There you have him. However contracted,\\r\\nthat definition is the result of expanded meditation. A walrus spouts much like\\r\\na whale, but the walrus is not a fish, because he is amphibious. But the last\\r\\nterm of the definition is still more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost\\r\\nany one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a\\r\\nflat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the\\r\\ntail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal\\r\\nposition.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from the\\r\\nleviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by\\r\\nthe best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand, link with it any fish\\r\\nhitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.* Hence, all the smaller, spouting\\r\\nand horizontal tailed fish must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology.\\r\\nNow, then, come the grand divisions of the entire whale host.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and Dugongs\\r\\n(Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are included by many\\r\\nnaturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish are a noisy, contemptible\\r\\nset, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and\\r\\nespecially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials as whales; and have\\r\\npresented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFirst: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary BOOKS\\r\\n(subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them all, both small\\r\\nand large.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs the type of the FOLIO I present the Sperm Whale; of the OCTAVO, the Grampus;\\r\\nof the DUODECIMO, the Porpoise.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFOLIOS. Among these I here include the following chapters:\\xe2\\x80\\x94 I. The Sperm Whale;\\r\\nII. the Right Whale; III. the Fin Back Whale; IV. the Humpbacked Whale; V. the\\r\\nRazor Back Whale; VI. the Sulphur Bottom Whale.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<h5>BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER I. (Sperm Whale).\\xe2\\x80\\x94This whale, among the English of\\r\\nold vaguely known as the Trumpa whale and the Physeter whale, and the Anvil\\r\\nHeaded whale, is the present Cachalot of the French, and the Pottsfich of the\\r\\nGermans, and the Macrocephalus of the Long Words. He is, without doubt, the\\r\\nlargest inhabitant of the globe; the most formidable of all whales to\\r\\nencounter; the most majestic in aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in\\r\\ncommerce; he being the only creature from which that valuable substance,\\r\\nspermaceti, is obtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be\\r\\nenlarged upon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do.\\r\\nPhilologically considered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm\\r\\nwhale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his\\r\\noil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days\\r\\nspermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature\\r\\nidentical with the one then known in England as the Greenland or Right Whale.\\r\\nIt was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of\\r\\nthe Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses.\\r\\nIn those times, also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce, not being used for\\r\\nlight, but only as an ointment and medicament. It was only to be had from the\\r\\ndruggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the\\r\\ncourse of time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name\\r\\nwas still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so\\r\\nstrangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation must at last have\\r\\ncome to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really\\r\\nderived.</h5>\\r\\n<h5>BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER II. (Right Whale).\\xe2\\x80\\x94In one respect this is the most\\r\\nvenerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly hunted by man. It\\r\\nyields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen; and the oil specially\\r\\nknown as \"whale oil,\" an inferior article in commerce. Among the fishermen, he\\r\\nis indiscriminately designated by all the following titles: The Whale; the\\r\\nGreenland Whale; the Black Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right\\r\\nWhale. There is a deal of obscurity concerning the Identity of the species thus\\r\\nmultitudinously baptized. What then is the whale, which I include in the second\\r\\nspecies of my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists;\\r\\nthe Greenland Whale of the English Whalemen; the Baliene Ordinaire of the\\r\\nFrench whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale which for\\r\\nmore than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the\\r\\nArctic seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in\\r\\nthe Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor\\' West Coast, and various\\r\\nother parts of the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.</h5>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSome pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the English and\\r\\nthe right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree in all their grand\\r\\nfeatures; nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which\\r\\nto ground a radical distinction. It is by endless subdivisions based upon the\\r\\nmost inconclusive differences, that some departments of natural history become\\r\\nso repellingly intricate. The right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some\\r\\nlength, with reference to elucidating the sperm whale.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<h5>BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER III. (Fin-Back).\\xe2\\x80\\x94Under this head I reckon a\\r\\nmonster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and Long-John, has\\r\\nbeen seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so\\r\\noften descried by passengers crossing the Atlantic, in the New York\\r\\npacket-tracks. In the length he attains, and in his baleen, the Fin-back\\r\\nresembles the right whale, but is of a less portly girth, and a lighter color,\\r\\napproaching to olive. His great lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the\\r\\nintertwisting, slanting folds of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing\\r\\nfeature, the fin, from which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous\\r\\nobject. This fin is some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the\\r\\nhinder part of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed\\r\\nend. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible, this\\r\\nisolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface. When\\r\\nthe sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical ripples, and\\r\\nthis gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface, it\\r\\nmay well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a\\r\\ndial, with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the\\r\\nshadow often goes back. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater,\\r\\nas some men are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly\\r\\nrising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his straight and\\r\\nsingle lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain;\\r\\ngifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all\\r\\npresent pursuit from man; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable\\r\\nCain of his race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back. From having\\r\\nthe baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the right\\r\\nwhale, among a theoretic species denominated Whalebone whales, that is, whales\\r\\nwith baleen. Of these so-called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be\\r\\nseveral varieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed whales\\r\\nand beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed whales and\\r\\nrostrated whales, are the fisherman\\'s names for a few sorts.</h5>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn connexion with this appellative of \"Whalebone whales,\" it is of great\\r\\nimportance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in\\r\\nfacilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is in vain to attempt a\\r\\nclear classification of the Leviathan, founded upon either his baleen, or hump,\\r\\nor fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very\\r\\nobviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of\\r\\nCetology than any other detached bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his\\r\\nkinds, presents. How then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are\\r\\nthings whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of\\r\\nwhales, without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in\\r\\nother and more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked\\r\\nwhale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases. Then this same\\r\\nhumpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen; but there\\r\\nagain the similitude ceases. And it is just the same with the other parts above\\r\\nmentioned. In various sorts of whales, they form such irregular combinations;\\r\\nor, in the case of any one of them detached, such an irregular isolation; as\\r\\nutterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis. On this\\r\\nrock every one of the whale-naturalists has split.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the whale, in\\r\\nhis anatomy\\xe2\\x80\\x94there, at least, we shall be able to hit the right classification.\\r\\nNay; what thing, for example, is there in the Greenland whale\\'s anatomy more\\r\\nstriking than his baleen? Yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible\\r\\ncorrectly to classify the Greenland whale. And if you descend into the bowels\\r\\nof the various leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth\\r\\npart as available to the systematizer as those external ones already\\r\\nenumerated. What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily,\\r\\nin their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way. And this is the\\r\\nBibliographical system here adopted; and it is the only one that can possibly\\r\\nsucceed, for it alone is practicable. To proceed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<h5>BOOK I. (Folio) CHAPTER IV. (Hump Back).\\xe2\\x80\\x94This whale is often seen on the\\r\\nnorthern American coast. He has been frequently captured there, and towed into\\r\\nharbor. He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or you might call him the\\r\\nElephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the popular name for him does not\\r\\nsufficiently distinguish him, since the sperm whale also has a hump though a\\r\\nsmaller one. His oil is not very valuable. He has baleen. He is the most\\r\\ngamesome and light-hearted of all the whales, making more gay foam and white\\r\\nwater generally than any other of them.</h5>\\r\\n<h5>BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER V. ( Razor Back).\\xe2\\x80\\x94Of this whale little is known\\r\\nbut his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of a retiring\\r\\nnature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no coward, he has never\\r\\nyet shown any part of him but his back, which rises in a long sharp ridge. Let\\r\\nhim go. I know little more of him, nor does anybody else.</h5>\\r\\n<h5>BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER VI. (Sulphur Bottom).\\xe2\\x80\\x94Another retiring gentleman,\\r\\nwith a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along the Tartarian tiles in\\r\\nsome of his profounder divings. He is seldom seen; at least I have never seen\\r\\nhim except in the remoter southern seas, and then always at too great a\\r\\ndistance to study his countenance. He is never chased; he would run away with\\r\\nrope-walks of line. Prodigies are told of him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say\\r\\nnothing more that is true of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.</h5>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThus ends BOOK I. (Folio), and now begins BOOK II. (Octavo).\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOCTAVOES.* These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among which at\\r\\npresent may be numbered:\\xe2\\x80\\x94I., the Grampus; II., the Black Fish; III., the\\r\\nNarwhale; IV., the Thrasher; V., the Killer.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n*Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain. Because,\\r\\nwhile the whales of this order, though smaller than those of the former order,\\r\\nnevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure, yet the\\r\\nbookbinder\\'s Quarto volume in its dimensioned form does not preserve the shape\\r\\nof the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume does.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<h4>BOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER I. (Grampus).\\xe2\\x80\\x94Though this fish, whose loud\\r\\nsonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to landsmen, is\\r\\nso well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not popularly classed among\\r\\nwhales. But possessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan,\\r\\nmost naturalists have recognised him for one. He is of moderate octavo size,\\r\\nvarying from fifteen to twenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding\\r\\ndimensions round the waist. He swims in herds; he is never regularly hunted,\\r\\nthough his oil is considerable in quantity, and pretty good for light. By some\\r\\nfishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great\\r\\nsperm whale.</h4>\\r\\n<h5>BOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER II. (Black Fish).\\xe2\\x80\\x94I give the popular fishermen\\'s\\r\\nnames for all these fish, for generally they are the best. Where any name\\r\\nhappens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and suggest another. I do\\r\\nso now touching the Black Fish, so called because blackness is the rule among\\r\\nalmost all whales. So, call him the Hyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is\\r\\nwell known and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are\\r\\ncurved upwards, he carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face.\\r\\nThis whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in\\r\\nalmost all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in\\r\\nswimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more profitably\\r\\nemployed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena whale, to keep up\\r\\nthe supply of cheap oil for domestic employment\\xe2\\x80\\x94 as some frugal housekeepers,\\r\\nin the absence of company, and quite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow\\r\\ninstead of odorous wax. Though their blubber is very thin, some of these whales\\r\\nwill yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil.</h5>\\r\\n<h5>BOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER III. (Narwhale), that is, Nostril whale.\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\nAnother instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose from his\\r\\npeculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The creature is some\\r\\nsixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five feet, though some exceed\\r\\nten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly speaking, this horn is but a\\r\\nlengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the\\r\\nhorizontal. But it is only found on the sinister side, which has an ill effect,\\r\\ngiving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man.\\r\\nWhat precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to say.\\r\\nIt does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish;\\r\\nthough some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning\\r\\nover the bottom of the sea for food. Charley Coffin said it was used for an\\r\\nice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar Sea, and\\r\\nfinding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so breaks through. But\\r\\nyou cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct. My own opinion is,\\r\\nthat however this one-sided horn may really be used by the Narwhale\\xe2\\x80\\x94however\\r\\nthat may be\\xe2\\x80\\x94it would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in\\r\\nreading pamphlets. The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the\\r\\nHorned whale, and the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious example of the\\r\\nUnicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. From certain\\r\\ncloistered old authors I have gathered that this same sea-unicorn\\'s horn was in\\r\\nancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison, and as such,\\r\\npreparations of it brought immense prices. It was also distilled to a volatile\\r\\nsalts for fainting ladies the same way that the horns of the male deer are\\r\\nmanufactured into hartshorn. Originally it was in itself accounted an object of\\r\\ngreat curiosity. Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return\\r\\nfrom that voyage, when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him\\r\\nfrom a window of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames;\\r\\n\"when Sir Martin returned from that voyage,\" saith Black Letter, \"on bended\\r\\nknees he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale,\\r\\nwhich for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor.\" An Irish author\\r\\navers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, did likewise present to her\\r\\nhighness another horn, pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature.</h5>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a milk-white\\r\\nground color, dotted with round and oblong spots of black. His oil is very\\r\\nsuperior, clear and fine; but there is little of it, and he is seldom hunted.\\r\\nHe is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<h5>BOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER IV. (Killer).\\xe2\\x80\\x94Of this whale little is precisely\\r\\nknown to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed naturalists. From\\r\\nwhat I have seen of him at a distance, I should say that he was about the\\r\\nbigness of a grampus. He is very savage\\xe2\\x80\\x94a sort of Feegee fish. He sometimes\\r\\ntakes the great Folio whales by the lip, and hangs there like a leech, till the\\r\\nmighty brute is worried to death. The Killer is never hunted. I never heard\\r\\nwhat sort of oil he has. Exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon\\r\\nthis whale, on the ground of its indistinctness. For we are all killers, on\\r\\nland and on sea; Bonapartes and Sharks included.</h5>\\r\\n<h5>BOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER V. (Thrasher).\\xe2\\x80\\x94This gentleman is famous for his\\r\\ntail which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes. He mounts the Folio\\r\\nwhale\\'s back, and as he swims, he works his passage by flogging him; as some\\r\\nschoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process. Still less is known\\r\\nof the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both are outlaws, even in the lawless\\r\\nseas.</h5>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThus ends BOOK II. (Octavo), and begins BOOK III, (Duodecimo.)\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDUODECIMOES.\\xe2\\x80\\x94These include the smaller whales. I. The Huzza Porpoise.<br>\\r\\nII. The Algerine Porpoise. III. The Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTo those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may possibly\\r\\nseem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be\\r\\nmarshalled among WHALES\\xe2\\x80\\x94a word, which, in the popular sense, always conveys an\\r\\nidea of hugeness. But the creatures set down above as Duodecimoes are\\r\\ninfallibly whales, by the terms of my definition of what a whale is\\xe2\\x80\\x94i.e. a\\r\\nspouting fish, with a horizontal tail.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<h5>BOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER 1. (Huzza Porpoise).\\xe2\\x80\\x94This is the common\\r\\nporpoise found almost all over the globe. The name is of my own bestowal; for\\r\\nthere are more than one sort of porpoises, and something must be done to\\r\\ndistinguish them. I call him thus, because he always swims in hilarious shoals,\\r\\nwhich upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a\\r\\nFourth-of-July crowd. Their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the\\r\\nmariner. Full of fine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to\\r\\nwindward. They are the lads that always live before the wind. They are\\r\\naccounted a lucky omen. If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding\\r\\nthese vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the spirit of godly gamesomeness is\\r\\nnot in ye. A well-fed, plump Huzza Porpoise will yield you one good gallon of\\r\\ngood oil. But the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is\\r\\nexceedingly valuable. It is in request among jewellers and watchmakers. Sailors\\r\\nput it on their hones. Porpoise meat is good eating, you know. It may never\\r\\nhave occurred to you that a porpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that\\r\\nit is not very readily discernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch\\r\\nhim; and you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature.</h5>\\r\\n<h5>BOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER II. (Algerine Porpoise).\\xe2\\x80\\x94A pirate. Very\\r\\nsavage. He is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat larger than\\r\\nthe Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make. Provoke him, and he will\\r\\nbuckle to a shark. I have lowered for him many times, but never yet saw him\\r\\ncaptured.</h5>\\r\\n<h5>BOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER III. (Mealy-mouthed Porpoise).\\xe2\\x80\\x94The largest\\r\\nkind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it is known. The\\r\\nonly English name, by which he has hitherto been designated, is that of the\\r\\nfisher\\xe2\\x80\\x94Right-Whale Porpoise, from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in\\r\\nthe vicinity of that Folio. In shape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza\\r\\nPorpoise, being of a less rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat\\r\\nand gentleman-like figure. He has no fins on his back (most other porpoises\\r\\nhave), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue. But\\r\\nhis mealy-mouth spoils all. Though his entire back down to his side fins is of\\r\\na deep sable, yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark in a ship\\'s hull,\\r\\ncalled the \"bright waist,\" that line streaks him from stem to stern, with two\\r\\nseparate colors, black above and white below. The white comprises part of his\\r\\nhead, and the whole of his mouth, which makes him look as if he had just\\r\\nescaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag. A most mean and mealy aspect! His\\r\\noil is much like that of the common porpoise.</h5>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBeyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the Porpoise is\\r\\nthe smallest of the whales. Above, you have all the Leviathans of note. But\\r\\nthere are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive, half-fabulous whales, which, as an\\r\\nAmerican whaleman, I know by reputation, but not personally. I shall enumerate\\r\\nthem by their fore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be\\r\\nvaluable to future investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun.\\r\\nIf any of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then he\\r\\ncan readily be incorporated into this System, according to his Folio, Octavo,\\r\\nor Duodecimo magnitude:\\xe2\\x80\\x94 The Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk Whale; the\\r\\nPudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the Cannon Whale; the\\r\\nScragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale; the\\r\\nQuog Whale; the Blue Whale; &amp;c. From Icelandic, Dutch, and old English\\r\\nauthorities, there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed\\r\\nwith all manner of uncouth names. But I omit them as altogether obsolete; and\\r\\ncan hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but\\r\\nsignifying nothing.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFinally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be here, and\\r\\nat once, perfected. You cannot but plainly see that I have kept my word. But I\\r\\nnow leave my cetological System standing thus unfinished, even as the great\\r\\nCathedral of Cologne was left, with the cranes still standing upon the top of\\r\\nthe uncompleted tower. For small erections may be finished by their first\\r\\narchitects; grand ones, true ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity. God\\r\\nkeep me from ever completing anything. This whole book is but a draught\\xe2\\x80\\x94nay,\\r\\nbut the draught of a draught. Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 33</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Specksynder\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nConcerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place as any\\r\\nto set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising from the\\r\\nexistence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown of course in any\\r\\nother marine than the whale-fleet.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe large importance attached to the harpooneer\\'s vocation is evinced by the\\r\\nfact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries and more ago, the\\r\\ncommand of a whale-ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the\\r\\ncaptain, but was divided between him and an officer called the Specksynder.\\r\\nLiterally this word means Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time made it\\r\\nequivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In those days, the captain\\'s authority was\\r\\nrestricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel; while over\\r\\nthe whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the Specksynder or Chief\\r\\nHarpooneer reigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the\\r\\ncorrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but\\r\\nhis former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply as senior\\r\\nHarpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain\\'s more inferior subalterns.\\r\\nNevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a\\r\\nwhaling voyage largely depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not\\r\\nonly an important officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night\\r\\nwatches on a whaling ground) the command of the ship\\'s deck is also his;\\r\\ntherefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he should\\r\\nnominally live apart from the men before the mast, and be in some way\\r\\ndistinguished as their professional superior; though always, by them,\\r\\nfamiliarly regarded as their social equal.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is this\\xe2\\x80\\x94the\\r\\nfirst lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and merchantmen alike,\\r\\nthe mates have their quarters with the captain; and so, too, in most of the\\r\\nAmerican whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship. That\\r\\nis to say, they take their meals in the captain\\'s cabin, and sleep in a place\\r\\nindirectly communicating with it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThough the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest of all\\r\\nvoyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and the community\\r\\nof interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high or low, depend for\\r\\ntheir profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their common luck, together with\\r\\ntheir common vigilance, intrepidity, and hard work; though all these things do\\r\\nin some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen\\r\\ngenerally; yet, never mind how much like an old Mesopotamian family these\\r\\nwhalemen may, in some primitive instances, live together; for all that, the\\r\\npunctilious externals, at least, of the quarter-deck are seldom materially\\r\\nrelaxed, and in no instance done away. Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in\\r\\nwhich you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated\\r\\ngrandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost as much\\r\\noutward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of\\r\\npilot-cloth.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least given to\\r\\nthat sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage he ever exacted,\\r\\nwas implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he required no man to remove the\\r\\nshoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter-deck; and though there were\\r\\ntimes when, owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to\\r\\nbe detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or in\\r\\nterrorem, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means unobservant of\\r\\nthe paramount forms and usages of the sea.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind those forms\\r\\nand usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself; incidentally making use of\\r\\nthem for other and more private ends than they were legitimately intended to\\r\\nsubserve. That certain sultanism of his brain, which had otherwise in a good\\r\\ndegree remained unmanifested; through those forms that same sultanism became\\r\\nincarnate in an irresistible dictatorship. For be a man\\'s intellectual\\r\\nsuperiority what it will, it can never assume the practical, available\\r\\nsupremacy over other men, without the aid of some sort of external arts and\\r\\nentrenchments, always, in themselves, more or less paltry and base. This it is,\\r\\nthat for ever keeps God\\'s true princes of the Empire from the world\\'s hustings;\\r\\nand leaves the highest honors that this air can give, to those men who become\\r\\nfamous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of\\r\\nthe Divine Inert, than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level\\r\\nof the mass. Such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme\\r\\npolitical superstitions invest them, that in some royal instances even to idiot\\r\\nimbecility they have imparted potency. But when, as in the case of Nicholas the\\r\\nCzar, the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain;\\r\\nthen, the plebeian herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization.\\r\\nNor, will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its\\r\\nfullest sweep and direct swing, ever forget a hint, incidentally so important\\r\\nin his art, as the one now alluded to.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket grimness and\\r\\nshagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and Kings, I must not conceal\\r\\nthat I have only to do with a poor old whale-hunter like him; and, therefore,\\r\\nall outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me. Oh, Ahab! what\\r\\nshall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived\\r\\nfor in the deep, and featured in the unbodied air!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 34</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Cabin-Table\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale loaf-of-bread face\\r\\nfrom the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord and master who, sitting in\\r\\nthe lee quarter-boat, has just been taking an observation of the sun; and is\\r\\nnow mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth, medallion-shaped tablet,\\r\\nreserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg. From his\\r\\ncomplete inattention to the tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not\\r\\nheard his menial. But presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings\\r\\nhimself to the deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, \"Dinner, Mr.\\r\\nStarbuck,\" disappears into the cabin.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen the last echo of his sultan\\'s step has died away, and Starbuck, the first\\r\\nEmir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then Starbuck rouses from\\r\\nhis quietude, takes a few turns along the planks, and, after a grave peep into\\r\\nthe binnacle, says, with some touch of pleasantness, \"Dinner, Mr. Stubb,\" and\\r\\ndescends the scuttle. The second Emir lounges about the rigging awhile, and\\r\\nthen slightly shaking the main brace, to see whether it will be all right with\\r\\nthat important rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a rapid\\r\\n\"Dinner, Mr. Flask,\" follows after his predecessors.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck, seems to\\r\\nfeel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all sorts of knowing\\r\\nwinks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his shoes, he strikes into a\\r\\nsharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the Grand Turk\\'s head; and\\r\\nthen, by a dexterous sleight, pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a\\r\\nshelf, he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the\\r\\ndeck, reversing all other processions, by bringing up the rear with music. But\\r\\nere stepping into the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face\\r\\naltogether, and, then, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab\\'s\\r\\npresence, in the character of Abjectus, or the Slave.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artificialness\\r\\nof sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck some officers will, upon\\r\\nprovocation, bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their\\r\\ncommander; yet, ten to one, let those very officers the next moment go down to\\r\\ntheir customary dinner in that same commander\\'s cabin, and straightway their\\r\\ninoffensive, not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at\\r\\nthe head of the table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore\\r\\nthis difference? A problem? Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of\\r\\nBabylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously, therein\\r\\ncertainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur. But he who in the\\r\\nrightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinner-table\\r\\nof invited guests, that man\\'s unchallenged power and dominion of individual\\r\\ninfluence for the time; that man\\'s royalty of state transcends Belshazzar\\'s,\\r\\nfor Belshazzar was not the greatest. Who has but once dined his friends, has\\r\\ntasted what it is to be Caesar. It is a witchery of social czarship which there\\r\\nis no withstanding. Now, if to this consideration you super-add the official\\r\\nsupremacy of a ship-master, then, by inference, you will derive the cause of\\r\\nthat peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOver his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion on the\\r\\nwhite coral beach, surrounded by his war-like but still deferential cubs. In\\r\\nhis own proper turn, each officer waited to be served. They were as little\\r\\nchildren before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab, there seemed not to lurk the smallest\\r\\nsocial arrogance. With one mind, their intent eyes all fastened upon the old\\r\\nman\\'s knife, as he carved the chief dish before him. I do not suppose that for\\r\\nthe world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation,\\r\\neven upon so neutral a topic as the weather. No! And when reaching out his\\r\\nknife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab thereby\\r\\nmotioned Starbuck\\'s plate towards him, the mate received his meat as though\\r\\nreceiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little started if, perchance, the\\r\\nknife grazed against the plate; and chewed it noiselessly; and swallowed it,\\r\\nnot without circumspection. For, like the Coronation banquet at Frankfort,\\r\\nwhere the German Emperor profoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so\\r\\nthese cabin meals were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at\\r\\ntable old Ahab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a\\r\\nrelief it was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold\\r\\nbelow. And poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this\\r\\nweary family party. His were the shin-bones of the saline beef; his would have\\r\\nbeen the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help himself, this must have\\r\\nseemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree. Had he helped himself\\r\\nat that table, doubtless, never more would he have been able to hold his head\\r\\nup in this honest world; nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him.\\r\\nAnd had Flask helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as\\r\\nnoticed it. Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter. Whether\\r\\nhe thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on account of its clotting\\r\\nhis clear, sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in\\r\\nsuch marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and therefore was not for him,\\r\\na subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnother thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask is the\\r\\nfirst man up. Consider! For hereby Flask\\'s dinner was badly jammed in point of\\r\\ntime. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him; and yet they also have the\\r\\nprivilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than\\r\\nFlask, happens to have but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of\\r\\nconcluding his repast, then Flask must bestir himself, he will not get more\\r\\nthan three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to\\r\\nprecede Flask to the deck. Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in\\r\\nprivate, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that\\r\\nmoment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or\\r\\nless. For what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal\\r\\nin him. Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from my\\r\\nstomach. I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fist a bit of old-fashioned\\r\\nbeef in the fore-castle, as I used to when I was before the mast. There\\'s the\\r\\nfruits of promotion now; there\\'s the vanity of glory: there\\'s the insanity of\\r\\nlife! Besides, if it were so that any mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge\\r\\nagainst Flask in Flask\\'s official capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order\\r\\nto obtain ample vengeance, was to go aft at dinnertime, and get a peep at Flask\\r\\nthrough the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful Ahab.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the\\r\\nPequod\\'s cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted order to their\\r\\narrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was restored to some hurried\\r\\norder by the pallid steward. And then the three harpooneers were bidden to the\\r\\nfeast, they being its residuary legatees. They made a sort of temporary\\r\\nservants\\' hall of the high and mighty cabin.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible\\r\\ndomineerings of the captain\\'s table, was the entire care-free license and ease,\\r\\nthe almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers. While\\r\\ntheir masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own\\r\\njaws, the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a\\r\\nreport to it. They dined like lords; they filled their bellies like Indian\\r\\nships all day loading with spices. Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and\\r\\nTashtego, that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the\\r\\npale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly\\r\\nquarried out of the solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he did not\\r\\ngo with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of\\r\\naccelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise. And once Daggoo,\\r\\nseized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy\\'s memory by snatching him up\\r\\nbodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher, while\\r\\nTashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping\\r\\nhim. He was naturally a very nervous, shuddering sort of little fellow, this\\r\\nbread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse. And\\r\\nwhat with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical\\r\\ntumultuous visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy\\'s whole life was one\\r\\ncontinual lip-quiver. Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all\\r\\nthings they demanded, he would escape from their clutches into his little\\r\\npantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its\\r\\ndoor, till all was over.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing his filed\\r\\nteeth to the Indian\\'s; crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on the floor, for a\\r\\nbench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low carlines; at every\\r\\nmotion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin framework to shake, as when\\r\\nan African elephant goes passenger in a ship. But for all this, the great negro\\r\\nwas wonderfully abstemious, not to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that\\r\\nby such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused\\r\\nthrough so broad, baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble\\r\\nsavage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through\\r\\nhis dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by beef or\\r\\nby bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a mortal, barbaric\\r\\nsmack of the lip in eating\\xe2\\x80\\x94 an ugly sound enough\\xe2\\x80\\x94so much so, that the trembling\\r\\nDough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own\\r\\nlean arms. And when he would hear Tashtego singing out for him to produce\\r\\nhimself, that his bones might be picked, the simple-witted Steward all but\\r\\nshattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of\\r\\nthe palsy. Nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their\\r\\npockets, for their lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at\\r\\ndinner, they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did\\r\\nnot at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget that in his\\r\\nIsland days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been guilty of some\\r\\nmurderous, convivial indiscretion. Alas! Dough-Boy! hard fares the white waiter\\r\\nwho waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin should he carry on his arm, but a\\r\\nbuckler. In good time, though, to his great delight, the three salt-sea\\r\\nwarriors would rise and depart; to his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all\\r\\ntheir martial bones jingling in them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in\\r\\nscabbards.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived there;\\r\\nstill, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were scarcely ever in\\r\\nit except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time, when they passed through\\r\\nit to their own peculiar quarters.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale captains,\\r\\nwho, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights the ship\\'s cabin\\r\\nbelongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is, at any\\r\\ntime, permitted there. So that, in real truth, the mates and harpooneers of the\\r\\nPequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it.\\r\\nFor when they did enter it, it was something as a streetdoor enters a house;\\r\\nturning inwards for a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a\\r\\npermanent thing, residing in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in\\r\\nthe cabin was no companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though\\r\\nnominally included in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it.\\r\\nHe lived in the world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled\\r\\nMissouri. And as when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of the\\r\\nwoods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there,\\r\\nsucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab\\'s soul, shut\\r\\nup in the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 35</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Mast-Head\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the other\\r\\nseamen my first mast-head came round.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost simultaneously with\\r\\nthe vessel\\'s leaving her port; even though she may have fifteen thousand miles,\\r\\nand more, to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground. And if, after a\\r\\nthree, four, or five years\\' voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty\\r\\nin her\\xe2\\x80\\x94say, an empty vial even\\xe2\\x80\\x94 then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the\\r\\nlast! and not till her skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does\\r\\nshe altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a very\\r\\nancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate here. I take it,\\r\\nthat the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old Egyptians; because, in\\r\\nall my researches, I find none prior to them. For though their progenitors, the\\r\\nbuilders of Babel, must doubtless, by their tower, have intended to rear the\\r\\nloftiest mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was\\r\\nput to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the\\r\\nboard, in the dread gale of God\\'s wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel\\r\\nbuilders priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a nation of\\r\\nmast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general belief among\\r\\narchaeologists, that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes:\\r\\na theory singularly supported by the peculiar stairlike formation of all four\\r\\nsides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of their\\r\\nlegs, those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for\\r\\nnew stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a\\r\\nwhale just bearing in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of\\r\\nold times, who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole\\r\\nlatter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground\\r\\nwith a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless\\r\\nstander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or\\r\\nfrosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything out to the last,\\r\\nliterally died at his post. Of modern standers-of-mast-heads we have but a\\r\\nlifeless set; mere stone, iron, and bronze men; who, though well capable of\\r\\nfacing out a stiff gale, are still entirely incompetent to the business of\\r\\nsinging out upon discovering any strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon\\r\\nthe top of the column of Vendome stands with arms folded, some one hundred and\\r\\nfifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below, whether Louis\\r\\nPhilippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high\\r\\naloft on his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules\\'\\r\\npillars, his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals\\r\\nwill go. Admiral Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head\\r\\nin Trafalgar Square; and even when most obscured by that London smoke, token is\\r\\nyet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is smoke, must be fire.\\r\\nBut neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor Nelson, will answer a single\\r\\nhail from below, however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the\\r\\ndistracted decks upon which they gaze; however it may be surmised, that their\\r\\nspirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals\\r\\nand what rocks must be shunned.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head standers of\\r\\nthe land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not so, is plainly\\r\\nevinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole historian of Nantucket, stands\\r\\naccountable. The worthy Obed tells us, that in the early times of the whale\\r\\nfishery, ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game, the people\\r\\nof that island erected lofty spars along the seacoast, to which the look-outs\\r\\nascended by means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a\\r\\nhen-house. A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of\\r\\nNew Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the ready-manned\\r\\nboats nigh the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to\\r\\nthe one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads are\\r\\nkept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their regular turns (as\\r\\nat the helm), and relieving each other every two hours. In the serene weather\\r\\nof the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast-head: nay, to a dreamy\\r\\nmeditative man it is delightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the\\r\\nsilent decks, striding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts,\\r\\nwhile beneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters\\r\\nof the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus\\r\\nat old Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with\\r\\nnothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship indolently rolls; the drowsy\\r\\ntrade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor. For the most part, in\\r\\nthis tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests you; you hear no\\r\\nnews; read no gazettes; extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never\\r\\ndelude you into unnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions;\\r\\nbankrupt securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of\\r\\nwhat you shall have for dinner\\xe2\\x80\\x94 for all your meals for three years and more are\\r\\nsnugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years\\' voyage, as\\r\\noften happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the mast-head would\\r\\namount to several entire months. And it is much to be deplored that the place\\r\\nto which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural\\r\\nlife, should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy\\r\\ninhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling, such as\\r\\npertains to a bed, a hammock, a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any\\r\\nother of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate\\r\\nthemselves. Your most usual point of perch is the head of the t\\' gallant-mast,\\r\\nwhere you stand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen)\\r\\ncalled the t\\' gallant crosstrees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner\\r\\nfeels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull\\'s horns. To be sure, in cold\\r\\nweather you may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a watch-coat;\\r\\nbut properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more of a house than the\\r\\nunclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and\\r\\ncannot freely move about in it, nor even move out of it, without running great\\r\\nrisk of perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter);\\r\\nso a watch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or\\r\\nadditional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in\\r\\nyour body, and no more can you make a convenience closet of your watch-coat.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nConcerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a\\r\\nsouthern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits,\\r\\ncalled crow\\'s-nests, in which the look-outs of a Greenland whaler are protected\\r\\nfrom the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In the fireside narrative of\\r\\nCaptain Sleet, entitled \"A Voyage among the Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland\\r\\nWhale, and incidentally for the re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of\\r\\nOld Greenland;\" in this admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are\\r\\nfurnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently\\r\\ninvented crow\\'s-nest of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet\\'s good\\r\\ncraft. He called it the Sleet\\'s crow\\'s-nest, in honor of himself; he being the\\r\\noriginal inventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous false delicacy,\\r\\nand holding that if we call our own children after our own names (we fathers\\r\\nbeing the original inventors and patentees), so likewise should we denominate\\r\\nafter ourselves any other apparatus we may beget. In shape, the Sleet\\'s\\r\\ncrow\\'s-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe; it is open above,\\r\\nhowever, where it is furnished with a movable sidescreen to keep to windward of\\r\\nyour head in a hard gale. Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend\\r\\ninto it through a little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or side\\r\\nnext the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for\\r\\numbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather rack, in which to keep\\r\\nyour speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical conveniences. When\\r\\nCaptain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in this crow\\'s-nest of his, he\\r\\ntells us that he always had a rifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together\\r\\nwith a powder flask and shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray\\r\\nnarwhales, or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot\\r\\nsuccessfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water,\\r\\nbut to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it was plainly a\\r\\nlabor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the little\\r\\ndetailed conveniences of his crow\\'s-nest; but though he so enlarges upon many\\r\\nof these, and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his\\r\\nexperiments in this crow\\'s-nest, with a small compass he kept there for the\\r\\npurpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called the \"local\\r\\nattraction\" of all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal\\r\\nvicinity of the iron in the ship\\'s planks, and in the Glacier\\'s case, perhaps,\\r\\nto there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I say,\\r\\nthat though the Captain is very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his\\r\\nlearned \"binnacle deviations,\" \"azimuth compass observations,\" and \"approximate\\r\\nerrors,\" he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was not so much immersed in\\r\\nthose profound magnetic meditations, as to fail being attracted occasionally\\r\\ntowards that well replenished little case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one\\r\\nside of his crow\\'s nest, within easy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole,\\r\\nI greatly admire and even love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain; yet\\r\\nI take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case-bottle,\\r\\nseeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been, while with\\r\\nmittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in\\r\\nthat bird\\'s nest within three or four perches of the pole.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as Captain\\r\\nSleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is greatly\\r\\ncounter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive seas in\\r\\nwhich we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used to lounge up the rigging\\r\\nvery leisurely, resting in the top to have a chat with Queequeg, or any one\\r\\nelse off duty whom I might find there; then ascending a little way further, and\\r\\nthrowing a lazy leg over the top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the\\r\\nwatery pastures, and so at last mount to my ultimate destination.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLet me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept but sorry\\r\\nguard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how could I\\xe2\\x80\\x94being left\\r\\ncompletely to myself at such a thought-engendering altitude\\xe2\\x80\\x94how could I but\\r\\nlightly hold my obligations to observe all whaleships\\' standing orders, \"Keep\\r\\nyour weather eye open, and sing out every time.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of Nantucket!\\r\\nBeware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow and\\r\\nhollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who offers to ship with\\r\\nthe Phaedon instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware of such an one, I say: your\\r\\nwhales must be seen before they can be killed; and this sunken-eyed young\\r\\nPlatonist will tow you ten wakes round the world, and never make you one pint\\r\\nof sperm the richer. Nor are these monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the\\r\\nwhale-fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and\\r\\nabsent-minded young men, disgusted with the corking care of earth, and seeking\\r\\nsentiment in tar and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches himself\\r\\nupon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship, and in moody\\r\\nphrase ejaculates:\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\"Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!<br>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0Ten thousand blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nVery often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young\\r\\nphilosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient \"interest\" in\\r\\nthe voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honorable\\r\\nambition, as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than\\r\\notherwise. But all in vain; those young Platonists have a notion that their\\r\\nvision is imperfect; they are short-sighted; what use, then, to strain the\\r\\nvisual nerve? They have left their opera-glasses at home.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Why, thou monkey,\" said a harpooneer to one of these lads, \"we\\'ve been\\r\\ncruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a whale yet.\\r\\nWhales are scarce as hen\\'s teeth whenever thou art up here.\" Perhaps they were;\\r\\nor perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon; but lulled\\r\\ninto such an opium-like listlessness of vacant, unconscious reverie is this\\r\\nabsent-minded youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts, that at\\r\\nlast he loses his identity; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible\\r\\nimage of that deep, blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature; and\\r\\nevery strange, half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him; every\\r\\ndimly-discovered, uprising fin of some undiscernible form, seems to him the\\r\\nembodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually\\r\\nflitting through it. In this enchanted mood, thy spirit ebbs away to whence it\\r\\ncame; becomes diffused through time and space; like Crammer\\'s sprinkled\\r\\nPantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a gently\\r\\nrolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from the inscrutable\\r\\ntides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on ye, move your foot or hand\\r\\nan inch; slip your hold at all; and your identity comes back in horror. Over\\r\\nDescartian vortices you hover. And perhaps, at midday, in the fairest weather,\\r\\nwith one half-throttled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the\\r\\nsummer sea, no more to rise for ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 36</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Quarter-Deck\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n(Enter Ahab: Then, all)\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one morning shortly\\r\\nafter breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the cabin-gangway to the deck.\\r\\nThere most sea-captains usually walk at that hour, as country gentlemen, after\\r\\nthe same meal, take a few turns in the garden.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSoon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old rounds,\\r\\nupon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over dented, like\\r\\ngeological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did you fixedly gaze,\\r\\ntoo, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also, you would see still stranger\\r\\nfoot-prints\\xe2\\x80\\x94the foot-prints of his one unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his nervous\\r\\nstep that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his thought was Ahab,\\r\\nthat at every uniform turn that he made, now at the main-mast and now at the\\r\\nbinnacle, you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned, and pace\\r\\nin him as he paced; so completely possessing him, indeed, that it all but\\r\\nseemed the inward mould of every outer movement.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"D\\'ye mark him, Flask?\" whispered Stubb; \"the chick that\\'s in him pecks the\\r\\nshell. \\'Twill soon be out.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe hours wore on;\\xe2\\x80\\x94Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing the deck,\\r\\nwith the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks, and\\r\\ninserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and with one hand grasping a\\r\\nshroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Sir!\" said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on\\r\\nship-board except in some extraordinary case.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Send everybody aft,\" repeated Ahab. \"Mast-heads, there! come down!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen the entire ship\\'s company were assembled, and with curious and not wholly\\r\\nunapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike the weather\\r\\nhorizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly glancing over the\\r\\nbulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew, started from his\\r\\nstandpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon\\r\\nthe deck. With bent head and half-slouched hat he continued to pace, unmindful\\r\\nof the wondering whispering among the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to\\r\\nFlask, that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a\\r\\npedestrian feat. But this did not last long. Vehemently pausing, he cried:\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Sing out for him!\" was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Good!\" cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the hearty\\r\\nanimation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically thrown them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"And what do ye next, men?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Lower away, and after him!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"And what tune is it ye pull to, men?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"A dead whale or a stove boat!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMore and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the countenance\\r\\nof the old man at every shout; while the mariners began to gaze curiously at\\r\\neach other, as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited\\r\\nat such seemingly purposeless questions.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his\\r\\npivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly, almost\\r\\nconvulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white whale.\\r\\nLook ye! d\\'ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94holding up a broad bright coin\\r\\nto the sun\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"it is a sixteen dollar piece, men. D\\'ye see it? Mr. Starbuck, hand\\r\\nme yon top-maul.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhile the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was slowly\\r\\nrubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if to heighten its\\r\\nlustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself,\\r\\nproducing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the\\r\\nmechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nReceiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast with\\r\\nthe hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the other, and with a\\r\\nhigh raised voice exclaiming: \"Whosoever of ye raises me a white-headed whale\\r\\nwith a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw; whosoever of ye raises me that\\r\\nwhite-headed whale, with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke\\xe2\\x80\\x94look ye,\\r\\nwhosoever of ye raises me that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce,\\r\\nmy boys!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Huzza! huzza!\" cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the\\r\\nact of nailing the gold to the mast.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"It\\'s a white whale, I say,\" resumed Ahab, as he threw down the topmaul: \"a\\r\\nwhite whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for white water; if ye see\\r\\nbut a bubble, sing out.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAll this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even more\\r\\nintense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of the wrinkled\\r\\nbrow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some\\r\\nspecific recollection.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Captain Ahab,\" said Tashtego, \"that white whale must be the same that some\\r\\ncall Moby Dick.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Moby Dick?\" shouted Ahab. \"Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?\" said the\\r\\nGay-Header deliberately.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"And has he a curious spout, too,\" said Daggoo, \"very bushy, even for a\\r\\nparmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"And he have one, two, tree\\xe2\\x80\\x94oh! good many iron in him hide, too, Captain,\"\\r\\ncried Queequeg disjointedly, \"all twiske-tee be-twisk, like him\\xe2\\x80\\x94him-\" faltering\\r\\nhard for a word, and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a\\r\\nbottle\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"like him\\xe2\\x80\\x94him-\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Corkscrew!\" cried Ahab, \"aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted and\\r\\nwrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole shock of\\r\\nwheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great annual\\r\\nsheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a split jib in a squall.\\r\\nDeath and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have seen\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Moby Dick\\xe2\\x80\\x94Moby Dick!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Captain Ahab,\" said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far been\\r\\neyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed struck with a\\r\\nthought which somewhat explained all the wonder. \"Captain Ahab, I have heard of\\r\\nMoby Dick\\xe2\\x80\\x94but it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Who told thee that?\" cried Ahab; then pausing, \"Aye, Starbuck; aye, my\\r\\nhearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that brought\\r\\nme to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,\" he shouted with a terrific,\\r\\nloud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose; \"Aye, aye! it was that\\r\\naccursed white whale that razeed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever\\r\\nand a day!\" Then tossing both arms, with measureless imprecations he shouted\\r\\nout: \"Aye, aye! and I\\'ll chase him round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and\\r\\nround the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition\\'s flames before I give him up.\\r\\nAnd this is what ye have shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both\\r\\nsides of land, and over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and\\r\\nrolls fin out. What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do\\r\\nlook brave.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Aye, aye!\" shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the excited\\r\\nold man: \"A sharp eye for the White Whale; a sharp lance for Moby Dick!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"God bless ye,\" he seemed to half sob and half shout.<br>\\r\\n\"God bless ye, men.

Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest a little\\r\\nlower layer. If money\\'s to be the measurer, man, and the accountants have\\r\\ncomputed their great counting-house the globe, by girdling it with guineas, one\\r\\nto every three parts of an inch; then, let me tell thee, that my vengeance will\\r\\nfetch a great premium here!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"He smites his chest,\" whispered Stubb, \"what\\'s that for? methinks it rings\\r\\nmost vast, but hollow.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Vengeance on a dumb brute!\" cried Starbuck, \"that simply smote thee from\\r\\nblindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing, Captain Ahab,\\r\\nseems blasphemous.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Hark ye yet again\\xe2\\x80\\x94the little lower layer. All visible objects, man, are but as\\r\\npasteboard masks. But in each event\\xe2\\x80\\x94in the living act, the undoubted\\r\\ndeed\\xe2\\x80\\x94there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of\\r\\nits features from behind the unreasoning mask. If man will strike, strike\\r\\nthrough the mask! How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting\\r\\nthrough the wall? To me, the white whale is that wall, shoved near to me.\\r\\nSometimes I think there\\'s naught beyond. But \\'tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps\\r\\nme; I see in him outrageous strength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it.\\r\\nThat inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or\\r\\nbe the white whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me\\r\\nof blasphemy, man; I\\'d strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the sun do\\r\\nthat, then could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of fair play\\r\\nherein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my master, man, is even\\r\\nthat fair play. Who\\'s over me? Truth hath no confines. Take off thine eye! more\\r\\nintolerable than fiends\\' glarings is a doltish stare! So, so; thou reddenest\\r\\nand palest; my heat has melted thee to anger-glow. But look ye, Starbuck, what\\r\\nis said in heat, that thing unsays itself. There are men from whom warm words\\r\\nare small indignity. I meant not to incense thee. Let it go. Look! see yonder\\r\\nTurkish cheeks of spotted tawn\\xe2\\x80\\x94living, breathing pictures painted by the sun.\\r\\nThe Pagan leopards\\xe2\\x80\\x94the unrecking and unworshipping things, that live; and seek,\\r\\nand give no reasons for the torrid life they feel! The crew, man, the crew! Are\\r\\nthey not one and all with Ahab, in this matter of the whale? See Stubb! he\\r\\nlaughs! See yonder Chilian! he snorts to think of it. Stand up amid the general\\r\\nhurricane, thy one tost sapling cannot, Starbuck! And what is it? Reckon it.\\r\\n\\'Tis but to help strike a fin; no wondrous feat for Starbuck. What is it more?\\r\\nFrom this one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all Nantucket, surely he\\r\\nwill not hang back, when every foremast-hand has clutched a whetstone. Ah!\\r\\nconstrainings seize thee; I see! the billow lifts thee! Speak, but speak!\\xe2\\x80\\x94Aye,\\r\\naye! thy silence, then, that voices thee. (Aside) Something shot from my\\r\\ndilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in his lungs. Starbuck now is mine; cannot\\r\\noppose me now, without rebellion.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"God keep me!\\xe2\\x80\\x94keep us all!\" murmured Starbuck, lowly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab did not\\r\\nhear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the hold; nor yet\\r\\nthe presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage; nor yet the hollow flap\\r\\nof the sails against the masts, as for a moment their hearts sank in. For again\\r\\nStarbuck\\'s downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life; the\\r\\nsubterranean laugh died away; the winds blew on; the sails filled out; the ship\\r\\nheaved and rolled as before. Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not\\r\\nwhen ye come? But rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not\\r\\nso much predictions from without, as verifications of the fore-going things\\r\\nwithin. For with little external to constrain us, the innermost necessities in\\r\\nour being, these still drive us on.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"The measure! the measure!\" cried Ahab.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nReceiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he ordered them\\r\\nto produce their weapons. Then ranging them before him near the capstan, with\\r\\ntheir harpoons in their hands, while his three mates stood at his side with\\r\\ntheir lances, and the rest of the ship\\'s company formed a circle round the\\r\\ngroup; he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew. But\\r\\nthose wild eyes met his, as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the\\r\\neye of their leader, ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison;\\r\\nbut, alas! only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Drink and pass!\" he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the nearest\\r\\nseaman. \"The crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short draughts\\xe2\\x80\\x94long\\r\\nswallows, men; \\'tis hot as Satan\\'s hoof. So, so; it goes round excellently. It\\r\\nspiralizes in ye; forks out at the serpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost\\r\\ndrained. That way it went, this way it comes. Hand it me\\xe2\\x80\\x94here\\'s a hollow! Men,\\r\\nye seem the years; so brimming life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Attend now, my braves. I have mustered ye all round this capstan; and ye\\r\\nmates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand there with your\\r\\nirons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some sort revive a\\r\\nnoble custom of my fisherman fathers before me. O men, you will yet see\\r\\nthat\\xe2\\x80\\x94Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies come not sooner. Hand it me.

Well done! Let me touch\\r\\nthe axis.\" So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the three level, radiating\\r\\nlances at their crossed centre; while so doing, suddenly and nervously twitched\\r\\nthem; meanwhile glancing intently from Starbuck to Stubb; from Stubb to Flask.\\r\\nIt seemed as though, by some nameless, interior volition, he would fain have\\r\\nshocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of\\r\\nhis own magnetic life. The three mates quailed before his strong, sustained,\\r\\nand mystic aspect. Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him; the honest eye of\\r\\nStarbuck fell downright.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"In vain!\" cried Ahab; \"but, maybe, \\'tis well. For did ye three but once take\\r\\nthe full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, that had perhaps expired\\r\\nfrom out me. Perchance, too, it would have dropped ye dead. Perchance ye need\\r\\nit not. Down lances! And now, ye mates, I do appoint ye three cupbearers to my\\r\\nthree pagan kinsmen there\\xe2\\x80\\x94 yon three most honorable gentlemen and noblemen, my\\r\\nvaliant harpooneers. Disdain the task? What, when the great Pope washes the\\r\\nfeet of beggars, using his tiara for ewer? Oh, my sweet cardinals! your own\\r\\ncondescension, that shall bend ye to it. I do not order ye; ye will it. Cut\\r\\nyour seizings and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSilently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the detached\\r\\niron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held, barbs up, before him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Stab me not with that keen steel! Cant them; cant them over! know ye not the\\r\\ngoblet end? Turn up the socket! So, so; now, ye cup-bearers, advance. The\\r\\nirons! take them; hold them while I fill!\" Forthwith, slowly going from one\\r\\nofficer to the other, he brimmed the harpoon sockets with the fiery waters from\\r\\nthe pewter.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Now, three to three, ye stand. Commend the murderous chalices! Bestow them, ye\\r\\nwho are now made parties to this indissoluble league. Ha! Starbuck! but the\\r\\ndeed is done! Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon it.

Starbuck paled, and turned, and shivered. Once more, and finally, the\\r\\nreplenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew; when, waving his\\r\\nfree hand to them, they all dispersed; and Ahab retired within his cabin.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 37</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSunset\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe cabin; by the stern windows; Ahab sitting alone, and gazing out.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where\\'er I sail.\\r\\nThe envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them; but first I\\r\\npass.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nYonder, by the ever-brimming goblet\\'s rim, the warm waves blush like wine.

A wild, mystical,\\r\\nsympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab\\'s quenchless feud seemed mine. With\\r\\ngreedy ears I learned the history of that murderous monster against whom I and\\r\\nall the others had taken our oaths of violence and revenge.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied, secluded White\\r\\nWhale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the Sperm Whale\\r\\nfishermen. But not all of them knew of his existence; only a few of them,\\r\\ncomparatively, had knowingly seen him; while the number who as yet had actually\\r\\nand knowingly given battle to him, was small indeed. For, owing to the large\\r\\nnumber of whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the\\r\\nentire watery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their quest\\r\\nalong solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more\\r\\non a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any sort; the\\r\\ninordinate length of each separate voyage; the irregularity of the times of\\r\\nsailing from home; all these, with other circumstances, direct and indirect,\\r\\nlong obstructed the spread through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the\\r\\nspecial individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be\\r\\ndoubted, that several vessels reported to have encountered, at such or such a\\r\\ntime, or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and\\r\\nmalignity, which whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, has\\r\\ncompletely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption, I say,\\r\\nthat the whale in question must have been no other than Moby Dick. Yet as of\\r\\nlate the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent\\r\\ninstances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster attacked;\\r\\ntherefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby\\r\\nDick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were content to ascribe the\\r\\npeculiar terror he bred, more, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale\\r\\nfishery at large, than to the individual cause. In that way, mostly, the\\r\\ndisastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly\\r\\nregarded.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance caught\\r\\nsight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them, almost,\\r\\nas boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any other whale of that\\r\\nspecies. But at length, such calamities did ensue in these assaults\\xe2\\x80\\x94 not\\r\\nrestricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken limbs, or devouring\\r\\namputations\\xe2\\x80\\x94but fatal to the last degree of fatality; those repeated disastrous\\r\\nrepulses, all accumulating and piling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those\\r\\nthings had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the\\r\\nstory of the White Whale had eventually come.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more horrify\\r\\nthe true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do fabulous rumors\\r\\nnaturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible events,\\xe2\\x80\\x94as the\\r\\nsmitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in maritime life, far more than in\\r\\nthat of terra firma, wild rumors abound, wherever there is any adequate reality\\r\\nfor them to cling to. And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the\\r\\nwhale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness\\r\\nand fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only are\\r\\nwhalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness\\r\\nhereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they are by all odds the most\\r\\ndirectly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the\\r\\nsea; face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw,\\r\\ngive battle to them. Alone, in such remotest waters, that though you sailed a\\r\\nthousand miles, and passed a thousand shores, you would not come to any\\r\\nchiselled hearth-stone, or aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in\\r\\nsuch latitudes and longitudes, pursuing too such a calling as he does, the\\r\\nwhaleman is wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with\\r\\nmany a mighty birth. No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere\\r\\ntransit over the wildest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale\\r\\ndid in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and\\r\\nhalf-formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which eventually\\r\\ninvested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly\\r\\nappears. So that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike, that few who\\r\\nby those rumors, at least, had heard of the White Whale, few of those hunters\\r\\nwere willing to encounter the perils of his jaw.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut there were still other and more vital practical influences at work. Nor\\r\\neven at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm Whale, as\\r\\nfearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan, died out of\\r\\nthe minds of the whalemen as a body. There are those this day among them, who,\\r\\nthough intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the Greenland or\\r\\nRight whale, would perhaps\\xe2\\x80\\x94either from professional inexperience, or\\r\\nincompetency, or timidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate,\\r\\nthere are plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not\\r\\nsailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered the Sperm\\r\\nWhale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble\\r\\nmonster primitively pursued in the North; seated on their hatches, these men\\r\\nwill hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange\\r\\ntales of Southern whaling. Nor is the preeminent tremendousness of the great\\r\\nSperm Whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows\\r\\nwhich stem him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times\\r\\nthrown its shadow before it; we find some book naturalists\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Olassen and\\r\\nPovelson\\xe2\\x80\\x94declaring the Sperm Whale not only to be a consternation to every\\r\\nother creature in the sea, but also to be so incredibly ferocious as\\r\\ncontinually to be athirst for human blood. Nor even down to so late a time as\\r\\nCuvier\\'s, were these or almost similar impressions effaced. For in his Natural\\r\\nHistory, the Baron himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish\\r\\n(sharks included) are \"struck with the most lively terrors,\" and \"often in the\\r\\nprecipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with such\\r\\nviolence as to cause instantaneous death.\" And however the general experiences\\r\\nin the fishery may amend such reports as these; yet in their full terribleness,\\r\\neven to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the superstitious belief in them is,\\r\\nin some vicissitudes of their vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few of the\\r\\nfishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days of the Sperm\\r\\nWhale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised Right\\r\\nwhalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare; such men\\r\\nprotesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued, yet to\\r\\nchase and point lances at such an apparition as the Sperm Whale was not for\\r\\nmortal man. That to attempt it, would be inevitably to be torn into a quick\\r\\neternity. On this head, there are some remarkable documents that may be\\r\\nconsulted.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things were ready\\r\\nto give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who, chancing only to\\r\\nhear of him distantly and vaguely, without the specific details of any certain\\r\\ncalamity, and without superstitious accompaniments were sufficiently hardy not\\r\\nto flee from the battle if offered.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOne of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked with\\r\\nthe White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was the unearthly\\r\\nconceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had actually been encountered in\\r\\nopposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit altogether\\r\\nwithout some faint show of superstitious probability. For as the secrets of the\\r\\ncurrents in the seas have never yet been divulged, even to the most erudite\\r\\nresearch; so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale when beneath the surface\\r\\nremain, in great part, unaccountable to his pursuers; and from time to time\\r\\nhave originated the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them,\\r\\nespecially concerning the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great\\r\\ndepth, he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely\\r\\ndistant points.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and as well\\r\\na thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby, that some\\r\\nwhales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose bodies have been\\r\\nfound the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland seas. Nor is it to be\\r\\ngainsaid, that in some of these instances it has been declared that the\\r\\ninterval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many\\r\\ndays. Hence, by inference, it has been believed by some whalemen, that the Nor\\'\\r\\nWest Passage, so long a problem to man, was never a problem to the whale. So\\r\\nthat here, in the real living experience of living men, the prodigies related\\r\\nin old times of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there\\r\\nwas said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface);\\r\\nand that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse\\r\\n(whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an underground\\r\\npassage); these fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities\\r\\nof the whalemen.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nForced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing that\\r\\nafter repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had escaped alive; it cannot\\r\\nbe much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their\\r\\nsuperstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for\\r\\nimmortality is but ubiquity in time); that though groves of spears should be\\r\\nplanted in his flanks, he would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he\\r\\nshould ever be made to spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly\\r\\ndeception; for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his\\r\\nunsullied jet would once more be seen.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in the\\r\\nearthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the\\r\\nimagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his uncommon bulk that\\r\\nso much distinguished him from other sperm whales, but, as was elsewhere thrown\\r\\nout\\xe2\\x80\\x94a peculiar snow-white wrinkled forehead, and a high, pyramidical white\\r\\nhump. These were his prominent features; the tokens whereby, even in the\\r\\nlimitless, uncharted seas, he revealed his identity, at a long distance, to\\r\\nthose who knew him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the same\\r\\nshrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive appellation of\\r\\nthe White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by his vivid aspect, when\\r\\nseen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea, leaving a milky-way wake of\\r\\ncreamy foam, all spangled with golden gleamings.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his deformed\\r\\nlower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural terror, as that\\r\\nunexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to specific accounts, he had\\r\\nover and over again evinced in his assaults. More than all, his treacherous\\r\\nretreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else. For, when swimming\\r\\nbefore his exulting pursuers, with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had\\r\\nseveral times been known to turn around suddenly, and, bearing down upon them,\\r\\neither stave their boats to splinters, or drive them back in consternation to\\r\\ntheir ship.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAlready several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar\\r\\ndisasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in the\\r\\nfishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale\\'s infernal\\r\\naforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death that he caused, was\\r\\nnot wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nJudge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of his more\\r\\ndesperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed boats, and the\\r\\nsinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the white curds of the whale\\'s\\r\\ndireful wrath into the serene, exasperating sunlight, that smiled on, as if at\\r\\na birth or a bridal.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHis three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the eddies;\\r\\none captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had dashed at the\\r\\nwhale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly seeking with a six inch\\r\\nblade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale. That captain was Ahab. And\\r\\nthen it was, that suddenly sweeping his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him,\\r\\nMoby Dick had reaped away Ahab\\'s leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field.\\r\\nNo turbaned Turk, no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more\\r\\nseeming malice. Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that\\r\\nalmost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the\\r\\nwhale, all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to\\r\\nidentify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and\\r\\nspiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam before him as the monomaniac\\r\\nincarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in\\r\\nthem, till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung. That\\r\\nintangible malignity which has been from the beginning; to whose dominion even\\r\\nthe modern Christians ascribe one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites\\r\\nof the east reverenced in their statue devil;\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Ahab did not fall down and\\r\\nworship it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred\\r\\nwhite whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. All that most\\r\\nmaddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with\\r\\nmalice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle\\r\\ndemonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly\\r\\npersonified, and made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon the\\r\\nwhale\\'s white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole\\r\\nrace from Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his\\r\\nhot heart\\'s shell upon it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the\\r\\nprecise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the monster,\\r\\nknife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate, corporal\\r\\nanimosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he probably but felt\\r\\nthe agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more. Yet, when by this collision\\r\\nforced to turn towards home, and for long months of days and weeks, Ahab and\\r\\nanguish lay stretched together in one hammock, rounding in mid winter that\\r\\ndreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed\\r\\nsoul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made him mad. That it was only\\r\\nthen, on the homeward voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania\\r\\nseized him, seems all but certain from the fact that, at intervals during the\\r\\npassage, he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital\\r\\nstrength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his\\r\\ndelirium, that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he\\r\\nsailed, raving in his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings\\r\\nof the gales. And, when running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with\\r\\nmild stun\\'sails spread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all\\r\\nappearances, the old man\\'s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn\\r\\nswells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air;\\r\\neven then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale, and issued\\r\\nhis calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was\\r\\nnow gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on. Human madness is\\r\\noftentimes a cunning and most feline thing. When you think it fled, it may have\\r\\nbut become transfigured into some still subtler form. Ahab\\'s full lunacy\\r\\nsubsided not, but deepeningly contracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that\\r\\nnoble Northman flows narrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge.\\r\\nBut, as in his narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab\\'s broad madness\\r\\nhad been left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great\\r\\nnatural intellect had perished. That before living agent, now became the living\\r\\ninstrument. If such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy stormed his\\r\\ngeneral sanity, and carried it, and turned all its concentred cannon upon its\\r\\nown mad mark; so that far from having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end,\\r\\ndid now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to\\r\\nbear upon any one reasonable object.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThis is much; yet Ahab\\'s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted. But vain\\r\\nto popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding far down from\\r\\nwithin the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we here stand\\xe2\\x80\\x94however\\r\\ngrand and wonderful, now quit it;\\xe2\\x80\\x94 and take your way, ye nobler, sadder souls,\\r\\nto those vast Roman halls of Thermes; where far beneath the fantastic towers of\\r\\nman\\'s upper earth, his root of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in\\r\\nbearded state; an antique buried beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes!\\r\\nSo with a broken throne, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a\\r\\nCaryatid, he patient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures\\r\\nof ages. Wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that proud, sad\\r\\nking! A family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled royalties; and\\r\\nfrom your grim sire only will the old State-secret come.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely; all my means are\\r\\nsane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or change, or\\r\\nshun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did now long dissemble; in\\r\\nsome sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling was only subject to his\\r\\nperceptibility, not to his will determinate. Nevertheless, so well did he\\r\\nsucceed in that dissembling, that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at\\r\\nlast, no Nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved, and that\\r\\nto the quick, with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to\\r\\na kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which always afterwards,\\r\\nto the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the present voyage, sat brooding on\\r\\nhis brow. Nor is it so very unlikely, that far from distrusting his fitness for\\r\\nanother whaling voyage, on account of such dark symptoms, the calculating\\r\\npeople of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those\\r\\nvery reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so\\r\\nfull of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and\\r\\nscorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea;\\r\\nsuch an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart his iron and\\r\\nlift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes. Or, if for any reason\\r\\nthought to be corporeally incapacitated for that, yet such an one would seem\\r\\nsuperlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack. But\\r\\nbe all this as it may, certain it is, that with the mad secret of his unabated\\r\\nrage bolted up and keyed in him, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present\\r\\nvoyage with the one only and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale.\\r\\nHad any one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was\\r\\nlurking in him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have\\r\\nwrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They were bent on profitable\\r\\ncruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint. He was intent\\r\\non an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural revenge.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHere, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses a Job\\'s\\r\\nwhale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made up of mongrel\\r\\nrenegades, and castaways, and cannibals\\xe2\\x80\\x94morally enfeebled also, by the\\r\\nincompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in Starbuck, the\\r\\ninvulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb, and the\\r\\npervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so officered, seemed specially\\r\\npicked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac\\r\\nrevenge. How it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old man\\'s ire\\xe2\\x80\\x94by\\r\\nwhat evil magic their souls were possessed, that at times his hate seemed\\r\\nalmost theirs; the White Whale as much their insufferable foe as his; how all\\r\\nthis came to be\\xe2\\x80\\x94what the White Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious\\r\\nunderstandings, also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have seemed the\\r\\ngliding great demon of the seas of life,\\xe2\\x80\\x94 all this to explain, would be to dive\\r\\ndeeper than Ishmael can go. The subterranean miner that works in us all, how\\r\\ncan one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting, muffled sound of his\\r\\npick? Who does not feel the irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a\\r\\nseventy-four can stand still? For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment of\\r\\nthe time and the place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale, could\\r\\nsee naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 42</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Whiteness of The Whale\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhat the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he was to\\r\\nme, as yet remains unsaid.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which could\\r\\nnot but occasionally awaken in any man\\'s soul some alarm, there was another\\r\\nthought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him, which at times by its\\r\\nintensity completely overpowered all the rest; and yet so mystical and well\\r\\nnigh ineffable was it, that I almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible\\r\\nform. It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me. But\\r\\nhow can I hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way,\\r\\nexplain myself I must, else all these chapters might be naught.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThough in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty, as if\\r\\nimparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles, japonicas, and pearls;\\r\\nand though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal\\r\\npreeminence in this hue; even the barbaric, grand old kings of Pegu placing the\\r\\ntitle \"Lord of the White Elephants\" above all their other magniloquent\\r\\nascriptions of dominion; and the modern kings of Siam unfurling the same\\r\\nsnow-white quadruped in the royal standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the\\r\\none figure of a snow-white charger; and the great Austrian Empire, Caesarian,\\r\\nheir to overlording Rome, having for the imperial color the same imperial hue;\\r\\nand though this pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself, giving the\\r\\nwhite man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe; and though, besides, all\\r\\nthis, whiteness has been even made significant of gladness, for among the\\r\\nRomans a white stone marked a joyful day; and though in other mortal sympathies\\r\\nand symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of many touching, noble\\r\\nthings\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the innocence of brides, the benignity of age; though among the Red Men\\r\\nof America the giving of the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of\\r\\nhonor; though in many climes, whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the\\r\\nermine of the Judge, and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens\\r\\ndrawn by milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most\\r\\naugust religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and\\r\\npower; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white forked flame being held the\\r\\nholiest on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies, Great Jove himself being\\r\\nmade incarnate in a snow-white bull; and though to the noble Iroquois, the\\r\\nmidwinter sacrifice of the sacred White Dog was by far the holiest festival of\\r\\ntheir theology, that spotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy\\r\\nthey could send to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own\\r\\nfidelity; and though directly from the Latin word for white, all Christian\\r\\npriests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic,\\r\\nworn beneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith,\\r\\nwhite is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord;\\r\\nthough in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the redeemed, and\\r\\nthe four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great-white\\r\\nthrone, and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool; yet for all these\\r\\naccumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and honorable, and sublime,\\r\\nthere yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue, which\\r\\nstrikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThis elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when\\r\\ndivorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object terrible in\\r\\nitself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds. Witness the white bear\\r\\nof the poles, and the white shark of the tropics; what but their smooth, flaky\\r\\nwhiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness\\r\\nit is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than\\r\\nterrific, to the dumb gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged\\r\\ntiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or\\r\\nshark.*\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n*With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who would\\r\\nfain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the whiteness, separately\\r\\nregarded, which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute; for,\\r\\nanalysed, that heightened hideousness, it might be said, only rises from the\\r\\ncircumstance, that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands\\r\\ninvested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing\\r\\ntogether two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear frightens us\\r\\nwith so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all this to be true; yet, were\\r\\nit not for the whiteness, you would not have that intensified terror.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that\\r\\ncreature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the same\\r\\nquality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly hit by the\\r\\nFrench in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish mass for the dead\\r\\nbegins with \"Requiem eternam\" (eternal rest), whence Requiem denominating the\\r\\nmass itself, and any other funeral music. Now, in allusion to the white, silent\\r\\nstillness of death in this shark, and the mild deadliness of his habits, the\\r\\nFrench call him Requin.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment\\r\\nand pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all imaginations? Not\\r\\nColeridge first threw that spell; but God\\'s great, unflattering laureate,\\r\\nNature.*\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n*I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged gale, in\\r\\nwaters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch below, I ascended\\r\\nto the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the main hatches, I saw a\\r\\nregal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and with a hooked, Roman bill\\r\\nsublime. At intervals, it arched forth its vast archangel wings, as if to\\r\\nembrace some holy ark. Wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it. Though\\r\\nbodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some king\\'s ghost in supernatural\\r\\ndistress. Through its inexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to\\r\\nsecrets which took hold of God. As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself;\\r\\nthe white thing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled\\r\\nwaters, I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns.\\r\\nLong I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only hint, the\\r\\nthings that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and turning, asked a\\r\\nsailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney! never had heard that\\r\\nname before; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to\\r\\nmen ashore! never! But some time after, I learned that goney was some seaman\\'s\\r\\nname for albatross. So that by no possibility could Coleridge\\'s wild Rhyme have\\r\\nhad aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw\\r\\nthat bird upon our deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the\\r\\nbird to be an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish a\\r\\nlittle brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks\\r\\nthe secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in this, that by a solecism\\r\\nof terms there are birds called grey albatrosses; and these I have frequently\\r\\nseen, but never with such emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will tell; with\\r\\na treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea. At last the\\r\\nCaptain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern tally round its neck,\\r\\nwith the ship\\'s time and place; and then letting it escape. But I doubt not,\\r\\nthat leathern tally, meant for man, was taken off in Heaven, when the white\\r\\nfowl flew to join the wing-folding, the invoking, and adoring cherubim!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMost famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the White\\r\\nSteed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger, large-eyed,\\r\\nsmall-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his\\r\\nlofty, overscorning carriage. He was the elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild\\r\\nhorses, whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains\\r\\nand the Alleghanies. At their flaming head he westward trooped it like that\\r\\nchosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of light. The flashing\\r\\ncascade of his mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings\\r\\nmore resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him. A most\\r\\nimperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western world, which to\\r\\nthe eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval\\r\\ntimes when Adam walked majestic as a god, bluff-bowed and fearless as this\\r\\nmighty steed. Whether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of\\r\\ncountless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or\\r\\nwhether with his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the\\r\\nWhite Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his\\r\\ncool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to the bravest\\r\\nIndians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe. Nor can it be\\r\\nquestioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse, that it\\r\\nwas his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so clothed him with divineness; and\\r\\nthat this divineness had that in it which, though commanding worship, at the\\r\\nsame time enforced a certain nameless terror.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that accessory and\\r\\nstrange glory which invests it in the White Steed and Albatross.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhat is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks the\\r\\neye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It is that\\r\\nwhiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name he bears. The Albino\\r\\nis as well made as other men\\xe2\\x80\\x94 has no substantive deformity\\xe2\\x80\\x94and yet this mere\\r\\naspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the\\r\\nugliest abortion. Why should this be so?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but not the less\\r\\nmalicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this crowning attribute of\\r\\nthe terrible. From its snowy aspect, the gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas\\r\\nhas been denominated the White Squall. Nor, in some historic instances, has the\\r\\nart of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary. How wildly it heightens the\\r\\neffect of that passage in Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their\\r\\nfaction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the\\r\\nmarket-place!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all mankind fail\\r\\nto bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It cannot well be doubted,\\r\\nthat the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the\\r\\ngazer, is the marble pallor lingering there; as if indeed that pallor were as\\r\\nmuch like the badge of consternation in the other world, as of mortal\\r\\ntrepidation here. And from that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive\\r\\nhue of the shroud in which we wrap them. Nor even in our superstitions do we\\r\\nfail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts rising in a\\r\\nmilk-white fog\\xe2\\x80\\x94Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us add, that even the\\r\\nking of terrors, when personified by the evangelist, rides on his pallid horse.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTherefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious thing he\\r\\nwill by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest idealized\\r\\nsignificance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to account\\r\\nfor it? To analyse it, would seem impossible. Can we, then, by the citation of\\r\\nsome of those instances wherein this thing of whiteness\\xe2\\x80\\x94though for the time\\r\\neither wholly or in great part stripped of all direct associations calculated\\r\\nto impart to it aught fearful, but nevertheless, is found to exert over us the\\r\\nsame sorcery, however modified;\\xe2\\x80\\x94 can we thus hope to light upon some chance\\r\\nclue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLet us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety, and\\r\\nwithout imagination no man can follow another into these halls. And though,\\r\\ndoubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented\\r\\nmay have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of\\r\\nthem at the time, and therefore may not be able to recall them now.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhy to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely acquainted\\r\\nwith the peculiar character of the day, does the bare mention of Whitsuntide\\r\\nmarshal in the fancy such long, dreary, speechless processions of slow-pacing\\r\\npilgrims, down-cast and hooded with new-fallen snow? Or to the unread,\\r\\nunsophisticated Protestant of the Middle American States, why does the passing\\r\\nmention of a White Friar or a White Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the\\r\\nsoul?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOr what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings\\r\\n(which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White Tower of London\\r\\ntell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled American, than\\r\\nthose other storied structures, its neighbors\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the Byward Tower, or even the\\r\\nBloody? And those sublimer towers, the White Mountains of New Hampshire,\\r\\nwhence, in peculiar moods, comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the\\r\\nbare mention of that name, while the thought of Virginia\\'s Blue Ridge is full\\r\\nof a soft, dewy, distant dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all latitudes and\\r\\nlongitudes, does the name of the White Sea exert such a spectralness over the\\r\\nfancy, while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long\\r\\nlacquered mild afternoons on the waves, followed by the gaudiest and yet\\r\\nsleepiest of sunsets? Or, to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance, purely\\r\\naddressed to the fancy, why, in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe,\\r\\ndoes \"the tall pale man\" of the Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor\\r\\nunrestingly glides through the green of the groves\\xe2\\x80\\x94 why is this phantom more\\r\\nterrible than all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling earthquakes;\\r\\nnor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the tearlessness of arid skies that\\r\\nnever rain; nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires, wrenched\\r\\ncope-stones, and crosses all adroop (like canted yards of anchored fleets); and\\r\\nher suburban avenues of house-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed\\r\\npack of cards;\\xe2\\x80\\x94 it is not these things alone which make tearless Lima, the\\r\\nstrangest, saddest city thou can\\'st see. For Lima has taken the white veil; and\\r\\nthere is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe. Old as Pizarro, this\\r\\nwhiteness keeps her ruins for ever new; admits not the cheerful greenness of\\r\\ncomplete decay; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an\\r\\napoplexy that fixes its own distortions.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness is not\\r\\nconfessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise\\r\\nterrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those\\r\\nappearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consists in this one\\r\\nphenomenon, especially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to\\r\\nmuteness or universality. What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be\\r\\nrespectively elucidated by the following examples.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFirst: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if by night\\r\\nhe hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels just enough of\\r\\ntrepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under precisely similar\\r\\ncircumstances, let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing\\r\\nthrough a midnight sea of milky whiteness\\xe2\\x80\\x94 as if from encircling headlands\\r\\nshoals of combed white bears were swimming round him, then he feels a silent,\\r\\nsuperstitious dread; the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to\\r\\nhim as a real ghost; in vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings;\\r\\nheart and helm they both go down; he never rests till blue water is under him\\r\\nagain. Yet where is the mariner who will tell thee, \"Sir, it was not so much\\r\\nthe fear of striking hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous whiteness that\\r\\nso stirred me?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSecond: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the snowhowdahed\\r\\nAndes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the mere fancying of the\\r\\neternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes, and the natural\\r\\nconceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman\\r\\nsolitudes. Much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the West, who with\\r\\ncomparative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow,\\r\\nno shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not so the\\r\\nsailor, beholding the scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at times, by some\\r\\ninfernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and\\r\\nhalf shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery,\\r\\nviews what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice\\r\\nmonuments and splintered crosses.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut thou sayest, methinks this white-lead chapter about whiteness is but a\\r\\nwhite flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a hypo, Ishmael.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of Vermont,\\r\\nfar removed from all beasts of prey\\xe2\\x80\\x94 why is it that upon the sunniest day, if\\r\\nyou but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that he cannot even see it,\\r\\nbut only smells its wild animal muskiness\\xe2\\x80\\x94why will he start, snort, and with\\r\\nbursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright? There is no remembrance\\r\\nin him of any gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home, so that the\\r\\nstrange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the\\r\\nexperience of former perils; for what knows he, this New England colt, of the\\r\\nblack bisons of distant Oregon?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNo; but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the knowledge\\r\\nof the demonism in the world. Though thousands of miles from Oregon, still when\\r\\nhe smells that savage musk, the rending, goring bison herds are as present as\\r\\nto the deserted wild foal of the prairies, which this instant they may be\\r\\ntrampling into dust.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings of the\\r\\nfestooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of\\r\\nprairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the shaking of that buffalo robe to the\\r\\nfrightened colt!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThough neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign\\r\\ngives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt, somewhere those things\\r\\nmust exist. Though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed in\\r\\nlove, the invisible spheres were formed in fright.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and learned why\\r\\nit appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange and far more\\r\\nportentous\\xe2\\x80\\x94why, as we have seen, it is at once the most meaning symbol of\\r\\nspiritual things, nay, the very veil of the Christian\\'s Deity; and yet should\\r\\nbe as it is, the intensifying agent in things the most appalling to mankind.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIs it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and\\r\\nimmensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of\\r\\nannihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky way? Or is it, that\\r\\nas in essence whiteness is not so much a color as the visible absence of color;\\r\\nand at the same time the concrete of all colors; is it for these reasons that\\r\\nthere is such a dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows\\xe2\\x80\\x94a\\r\\ncolorless, all-color of atheism from which we shrink? And when we consider that\\r\\nother theory of the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues\\xe2\\x80\\x94every\\r\\nstately or lovely emblazoning\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea,\\r\\nand the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of young girls;\\r\\nall these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent in substances, but\\r\\nonly laid on from without; so that all deified Nature absolutely paints like\\r\\nthe harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel-house within; and\\r\\nwhen we proceed further, and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces\\r\\nevery one of her hues, the great principle of light, for ever remains white or\\r\\ncolorless in itself, and if operating without medium upon matter, would touch\\r\\nall objects, even tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge\\xe2\\x80\\x94pondering all\\r\\nthis, the palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful travellers\\r\\nin Lapland, who refuse to wear colored and coloring glasses upon their eyes, so\\r\\nthe wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that\\r\\nwraps all the prospect around him. And of all these things the Albino whale was\\r\\nthe symbol.

Then seating himself before it, you would have seen him\\r\\nintently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye; and with\\r\\nslow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were\\r\\nblank. At intervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside him,\\r\\nwherein were set down the seasons and places in which, on various former\\r\\nvoyages of various ships, sperm whales had been captured or seen.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhile thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his head,\\r\\ncontinually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever threw shifting\\r\\ngleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till it almost seemed that\\r\\nwhile he himself was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts, some\\r\\ninvisible pencil was also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked\\r\\nchart of his forehead.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his cabin,\\r\\nAhab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were brought out;\\r\\nalmost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and others were substituted.\\r\\nFor with the charts of all four oceans before him, Ahab was threading a maze of\\r\\ncurrents and eddies, with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that\\r\\nmonomaniac thought of his soul.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans, it might\\r\\nseem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the\\r\\nunhooped oceans of this planet. But not so did it seem to Ahab, who knew the\\r\\nsets of all tides and currents; and thereby calculating the driftings of the\\r\\nsperm whale\\'s food; and, also calling to mind the regular, ascertained seasons\\r\\nfor hunting him in particular latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises,\\r\\nalmost approaching to certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be upon this\\r\\nor that ground in search of his prey.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm\\r\\nwhale\\'s resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe that, could he be\\r\\nclosely observed and studied throughout the world; were the logs for one voyage\\r\\nof the entire whale fleet carefully collated, then the migrations of the sperm\\r\\nwhale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the\\r\\nherring-shoals or the flights of swallows. On this hint, attempts have been\\r\\nmade to construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n*Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by an official\\r\\ncircular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National Observatory, Washington,\\r\\nApril 16th, 1851. By that circular, it appears that precisely such a chart is\\r\\nin course of completion; and portions of it are presented in the circular.\\r\\n\"This chart divides the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by\\r\\nfive degrees of longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are\\r\\ntwelve columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each of which\\r\\ndistricts are three lines; one to show the number of days that have been spent\\r\\nin each month in every district, and the two others to show the number of days\\r\\nin which whales, sperm or right, have been seen.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBesides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the sperm\\r\\nwhales, guided by some infallible instinct\\xe2\\x80\\x94say, rather, secret intelligence\\r\\nfrom the Deity\\xe2\\x80\\x94mostly swim in veins, as they are called; continuing their way\\r\\nalong a given ocean-line with such undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever\\r\\nsailed her course, by any chart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision.\\r\\nThough, in these cases, the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a\\r\\nsurveyor\\'s parallel, and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its\\r\\nown unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary vein in which at these times\\r\\nhe is said to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width (more or less,\\r\\nas the vein is presumed to expand or contract); but never exceeds the visual\\r\\nsweep from the whale-ship\\'s mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this\\r\\nmagic zone. The sum is, that at particular seasons within that breadth and\\r\\nalong that path, migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate\\r\\nfeeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing the\\r\\nwidest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his art, so place\\r\\nand time himself on his way, as even then not to be wholly without prospect of\\r\\na meeting.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious\\r\\nbut still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality, perhaps. Though the\\r\\ngregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds, yet\\r\\nin general you cannot conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a\\r\\nlatitude or longitude this year, say, will turn out to be identically the same\\r\\nwith those that were found there the preceding season; though there are\\r\\npeculiar and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved\\r\\ntrue. In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to\\r\\nthe solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So that though\\r\\nMoby Dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what is called the\\r\\nSeychelle ground in the Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet\\r\\nit did not follow that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any\\r\\nsubsequent corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there. So,\\r\\ntoo, with some other feeding-grounds, where he had at times revealed himself.\\r\\nBut all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to\\r\\nspeak, not his places of prolonged abode. And where Ahab\\'s chances of\\r\\naccomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been\\r\\nmade to whatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a\\r\\nparticular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities would become\\r\\nprobabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the next thing to\\r\\na certainty. That particular set time and place were conjoined in the one\\r\\ntechnical phrase\\xe2\\x80\\x94the Season-on-the-Line. For there and then, for several\\r\\nconsecutive years, Moby Dick had been periodically descried, lingering in those\\r\\nwaters for awhile, as the sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted\\r\\ninterval in any one sign of the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of the\\r\\ndeadly encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the waves were\\r\\nstoried with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac\\r\\nold man had found the awful motive to his vengeance. But in the cautious\\r\\ncomprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding\\r\\nsoul into this unfaltering hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his\\r\\nhopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might\\r\\nbe to those hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize\\r\\nhis unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the\\r\\nSeason-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her commander to\\r\\nmake the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and then running down\\r\\nsixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time to cruise\\r\\nthere. Therefore, he must wait for the next ensuing season. Yet the premature\\r\\nhour of the Pequod\\'s sailing had, perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab,\\r\\nwith a view to this very complexion of things. Because, an interval of three\\r\\nhundred and sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which,\\r\\ninstead of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt;\\r\\nif by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote from his\\r\\nperiodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian\\r\\nGulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any other waters haunted by\\r\\nhis race. So that Monsoons, Pampas, Nor-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind\\r\\nbut the Levanter and Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag\\r\\nworld-circle of the Pequod\\'s circumnavigating wake.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it not but a\\r\\nmad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one solitary whale, even if\\r\\nencountered, should be thought capable of individual recognition from his\\r\\nhunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of\\r\\nConstantinople? Yes. For the peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his\\r\\nsnow-white hump, could not but be unmistakable. And have I not tallied the\\r\\nwhale, Ahab would mutter to himself, as after poring over his charts till long\\r\\nafter midnight he would throw himself back in reveries\\xe2\\x80\\x94tallied him, and shall\\r\\nhe escape? His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep\\'s ear!\\r\\nAnd here, his mad mind would run on in a breathless race; till a weariness and\\r\\nfaintness of pondering came over him! and in the open air of the deck he would\\r\\nseek to recover his strength. Ah, God! what trances of torments does that man\\r\\nendure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps with\\r\\nclenched hands; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOften, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid dreams\\r\\nof the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through the day, carried\\r\\nthem on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them round and round and\\r\\nround in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing of his life-spot became\\r\\ninsufferable anguish; and when, as was sometimes the case, these spiritual\\r\\nthroes in him heaved his being up from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in\\r\\nhim, from which forked flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends\\r\\nbeckoned him to leap down among them; when this hell in himself yawned beneath\\r\\nhim, a wild cry would be heard through the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab\\r\\nwould burst from his state room, as though escaping from a bed that was on\\r\\nfire. Yet these, perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some\\r\\nlatent weakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of\\r\\nits intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly\\r\\nsteadfast hunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock,\\r\\nwas not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again. The\\r\\nlatter was the eternal, living principle or soul in him; and in sleep, being\\r\\nfor the time dissociated from the characterizing mind, which at other times\\r\\nemployed it for its outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from\\r\\nthe scorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was\\r\\nno longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the\\r\\nsoul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab\\'s case, yielding up all his\\r\\nthoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that purpose, by its own sheer\\r\\ninveteracy of will, forced itself against gods and devils into a kind of\\r\\nself-assumed, independent being of its own. Nay, could grimly live and burn,\\r\\nwhile the common vitality to which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from\\r\\nthe unbidden and unfathered birth. Therefore, the tormented spirit that glared\\r\\nout of bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the\\r\\ntime but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being, a ray of living\\r\\nlight, to be sure, but without an object to color, and therefore a blankness in\\r\\nitself. God help thee, old man, thy thoughts have created a creature in thee;\\r\\nand he whose intense thinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon\\r\\nthat heart for ever; that vulture the very creature he creates.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 45</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Affidavit\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed, as\\r\\nindirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in the\\r\\nhabits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in its earlier part, is as\\r\\nimportant a one as will be found in this volume; but the leading matter of it\\r\\nrequires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be\\r\\nadequately understood, and moreover to take away any incredulity which a\\r\\nprofound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the\\r\\nnatural verity of the main points of this affair.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be content\\r\\nto produce the desired impression by separate citations of items, practically\\r\\nor reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from these citations, I take it\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the\\r\\nconclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFirst: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after receiving a\\r\\nharpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an interval (in one\\r\\ninstance of three years), has been again struck by the same hand, and slain;\\r\\nwhen the two irons, both marked by the same private cypher, have been taken\\r\\nfrom the body. In the instance where three years intervened between the\\r\\nflinging of the two harpoons; and I think it may have been something more than\\r\\nthat; the man who darted them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading\\r\\nship on a voyage to Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and\\r\\npenetrated far into the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two\\r\\nyears, often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with\\r\\nall the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown\\r\\nregions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels;\\r\\nno doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all\\r\\nthe coasts of Africa; but to no purpose. This man and this whale again came\\r\\ntogether, and the one vanquished the other. I say I, myself, have known three\\r\\ninstances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and,\\r\\nupon the second attack, saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in\\r\\nthem, afterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so\\r\\nfell out that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the last time\\r\\ndistinctly recognized a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale\\'s eye, which\\r\\nI had observed there three years previous. I say three years, but I am pretty\\r\\nsure it was more than that. Here are three instances, then, which I personally\\r\\nknow the truth of; but I have heard of many other instances from persons whose\\r\\nveracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSecondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant the\\r\\nworld ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable historical\\r\\ninstances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and\\r\\nplaces popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became thus marked was not\\r\\naltogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished\\r\\nfrom other whales; for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may\\r\\nbe, they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him\\r\\ndown into a peculiarly valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the\\r\\nfatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness\\r\\nabout such a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most\\r\\nfishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins\\r\\nwhen he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea, without seeking to\\r\\ncultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some poor devils ashore that\\r\\nhappen to known an irascible great man, they make distant unobtrusive\\r\\nsalutations to him in the street, lest if they pursued the acquaintance\\r\\nfurther, they might receive a summary thump for their presumption.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual\\r\\ncelebrity\\xe2\\x80\\x94nay, you may call it an oceanwide renown; not only was he famous in\\r\\nlife and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death, but he was admitted\\r\\ninto all the rights, privileges, and distinctions of a name; had as much a name\\r\\nindeed as Cambyses or Caesar. Was it not so, O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan,\\r\\nscarred like an iceberg, who so long did\\'st lurk in the Oriental straits of\\r\\nthat name, whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay? Was it not\\r\\nso, O New Zealand Jack! thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in\\r\\nthe vicinity of the Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O Morquan! King of Japan, whose\\r\\nlofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white cross against\\r\\nthe sky? Was it not so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale, marked like an old\\r\\ntortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back! In plain prose, here are four\\r\\nwhales as well known to the students of Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla to\\r\\nthe classic scholar.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various times\\r\\ncreating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were finally gone in\\r\\nquest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed by valiant whaling\\r\\ncaptains, who heaved up their anchors with that express object as much in view,\\r\\nas in setting out through the Narragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it\\r\\nin his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage Annawon, the headmost\\r\\nwarrior of the Indian King Philip.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make mention\\r\\nof one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in printed form\\r\\nestablishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of the White\\r\\nWhale, more especially the catastrophe. For this is one of those disheartening\\r\\ninstances where truth requires full as much bolstering as error. So ignorant\\r\\nare most landsmen of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the\\r\\nworld, that without some hints touching the plain facts, historical and\\r\\notherwise, of the fishery, they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable,\\r\\nor still worse and more detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFirst: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general perils of\\r\\nthe grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid conception of\\r\\nthose perils, and the frequency with which they recur. One reason perhaps is,\\r\\nthat not one in fifty of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the\\r\\nfishery, ever finds a public record at home, however transient and immediately\\r\\nforgotten that record. Do you suppose that that poor fellow there, who this\\r\\nmoment perhaps caught by the whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being\\r\\ncarried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan\\xe2\\x80\\x94 do you suppose\\r\\nthat that poor fellow\\'s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will\\r\\nread to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very irregular\\r\\nbetween here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what might be called\\r\\nregular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I will tell you that upon\\r\\none particular voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many others we spoke\\r\\nthirty different ships, every one of which had had a death by a whale, some of\\r\\nthem more than one, and three that had each lost a boat\\'s crew. For God\\'s sake,\\r\\nbe economical with your lamps and candles! not a gallon you burn, but at least\\r\\none drop of man\\'s blood was spilled for it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSecondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an\\r\\nenormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that when narrating\\r\\nto them some specific example of this two-fold enormousness, they have\\r\\nsignificantly complimented me upon my facetiousness; when, I declare upon my\\r\\nsoul, I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses, when he wrote the\\r\\nhistory of the plagues of Egypt.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon testimony\\r\\nentirely independent of my own. That point is this: The Sperm Whale is in some\\r\\ncases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously malicious, as with direct\\r\\naforethought to stave in, utterly destroy, and sink a large ship; and what is\\r\\nmore, the Sperm Whale has done it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFirst: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket, was\\r\\ncruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her boats, and\\r\\ngave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of the whales were\\r\\nwounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping from the boats, issued\\r\\nfrom the shoal, and bore directly down upon the ship. Dashing his forehead\\r\\nagainst her hull, he so stove her in, that in less than \"ten minutes\" she\\r\\nsettled down and fell over. Not a surviving plank of her has been seen since.\\r\\nAfter the severest exposure, part of the crew reached the land in their boats.\\r\\nBeing returned home at last, Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific\\r\\nin command of another ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown\\r\\nrocks and breakers; for the second time his ship was utterly lost, and\\r\\nforthwith forswearing the sea, he has never attempted it since. At this day\\r\\nCaptain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket. I have seen Owen Chace, who was\\r\\nchief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy; I have read his plain and\\r\\nfaithful narrative; I have conversed with his son; and all this within a few\\r\\nmiles of the scene of the catastrophe.*\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n*The following are extracts from Chace\\'s narrative: \"Every fact seemed to\\r\\nwarrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his\\r\\noperations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at a short interval\\r\\nbetween them, both of this catastrophe I have never chanced to their direction,\\r\\nwere calculated to do us the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual\\r\\nallusions to it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J\\xe2\\x80\\x94-then commanding an\\r\\nAmerican sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be dining with a party of\\r\\nwhaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in the harbor of Oahu, Sandwich\\r\\nIslands. Conversation turning upon whales, the Commodore was pleased to be\\r\\nsceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional\\r\\ngentlemen present. He peremptorily denied for example, that any whale could so\\r\\nsmite his stout sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful.\\r\\nVery good; but there is more coming. Some weeks later, the Commodore set sail\\r\\nin this impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on the way by a\\r\\nportly sperm whale, that begged a few moments\\' confidential business with him.\\r\\nThat business consisted in fetching the Commodore\\'s craft such a thwack, that\\r\\nwith all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave down\\r\\nand repair. I am not superstitious, but I consider the Commodore\\'s interview\\r\\nwith that whale as providential. Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief\\r\\nby a similar fright? I tell you, the sperm whale will stand no nonsense.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI will now refer you to Langsdorff\\'s Voyages for a little circumstance in\\r\\npoint, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof. Langsdorff, you must know\\r\\nby the way, was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern\\'s famous Discovery\\r\\nExpedition in the beginning of the present century. Captain Langsdorff thus\\r\\nbegins his seventeenth chapter:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day we were\\r\\nout in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was very clear and\\r\\nfine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur clothing.\\r\\nFor some days we had very little wind; it was not till the nineteenth that a\\r\\nbrisk gale from the northwest sprang up. An uncommonly large whale, the body of\\r\\nwhich was larger than the ship itself, lay almost at the surface of the water,\\r\\nbut was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship, which\\r\\nwas in full sail, was almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its\\r\\nstriking against him. We were thus placed in the most imminent danger, as this\\r\\ngigantic creature, setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at least out\\r\\nof the water. The masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether, while we who\\r\\nwere below all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding that we had struck\\r\\nupon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost\\r\\ngravity and solemnity. Captain D\\'Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to\\r\\nexamine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock, but\\r\\nwe found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, the Captain D\\'Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in question, is\\r\\na New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual adventures as a sea-captain,\\r\\nthis day resides in the village of Dorchester near Boston. I have the honor of\\r\\nbeing a nephew of his. I have particularly questioned him concerning this\\r\\npassage in Langsdorff. He substantiates every word. The ship, however, was by\\r\\nno means a large one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast, and\\r\\npurchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from\\r\\nhome.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full, too, of\\r\\nhonest wonders\\xe2\\x80\\x94the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient Dampier\\'s old chums\\xe2\\x80\\x94I\\r\\nfound a little matter set down so like that just quoted from Langsdorff, that I\\r\\ncannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example, if such be\\r\\nneeded.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLionel, it seems, was on his way to \"John Ferdinando,\" as he calls the modern\\r\\nJuan Fernandes. \"In our way thither,\" he says, \"about four o\\'clock in the\\r\\nmorning, when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the Main of\\r\\nAmerica, our ship felt a terrible shock, which put our men in such\\r\\nconsternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to think; but\\r\\nevery one began to prepare for death. And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and\\r\\nviolent, that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock; but\\r\\nwhen the amazement was a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found\\r\\nno ground. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages,\\r\\nand several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks. Captain Davis, who\\r\\nlay with his head on a gun, was thrown out of his cabin!\" Lionel then goes on\\r\\nto impute the shock to an earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation\\r\\nby stating that a great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do\\r\\ngreat mischief along the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder if, in the\\r\\ndarkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all caused by\\r\\nan unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to me, of\\r\\nthe great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more than one\\r\\ninstance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing boats back to\\r\\ntheir ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long withstand all the lances\\r\\nhurled at him from its decks. The English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on\\r\\nthat head; and, as for his strength, let me say, that there have been examples\\r\\nwhere the lines attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been\\r\\ntransferred to the ship, and secured there! the whale towing her great hull\\r\\nthrough the water, as a horse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often\\r\\nobserved that, if the sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he\\r\\nthen acts, not so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of\\r\\ndestruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent\\r\\nindication of his character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open\\r\\nhis mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive\\r\\nminutes. But I must be content with only one more and a concluding\\r\\nillustration; a remarkable and most significant one, by which you will not fail\\r\\nto see, that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by\\r\\nplain facts of the present day, but that these marvels (like all marvels) are\\r\\nmere repetitions of the ages; so that for the millionth time we say amen with\\r\\nSolomon\\xe2\\x80\\x94Verily there is nothing new under the sun.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate of\\r\\nConstantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius general.\\r\\nAs many know, he wrote the history of his own times, a work every way of\\r\\nuncommon value. By the best authorities, he has always been considered a most\\r\\ntrustworthy and unexaggerating historian, except in some one or two\\r\\nparticulars, not at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term of his\\r\\nprefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured in the\\r\\nneighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed vessels at\\r\\nintervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years. A fact thus\\r\\nset down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid. Nor is there any\\r\\nreason it should be. Of what precise species this sea-monster was, is not\\r\\nmentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must\\r\\nhave been a whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale. And I\\r\\nwill tell you why. For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had been\\r\\nalways unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it.\\r\\nEven now I am certain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the\\r\\npresent constitution of things, a place for his habitual gregarious resort. But\\r\\nfurther investigations have recently proved to me, that in modern times there\\r\\nhave been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the\\r\\nMediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that on the Barbary coast, a\\r\\nCommodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale. Now,\\r\\nas a vessel of war readily passes through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale\\r\\ncould, by the same route, pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance called\\r\\nbrit is to be found, the aliment of the right whale. But I have every reason to\\r\\nbelieve that the food of the sperm whale\\xe2\\x80\\x94 squid or cuttle-fish\\xe2\\x80\\x94lurks at the\\r\\nbottom of that sea, because large creatures, but by no means the largest of\\r\\nthat sort, have been found at its surface. If, then, you properly put these\\r\\nstatements together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive\\r\\nthat, according to all human reasoning, Procopius\\'s sea-monster, that for half\\r\\na century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all probability have been\\r\\na sperm whale.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 46</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSurmises\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThough, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his thoughts and\\r\\nactions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick; though he seemed\\r\\nready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion; nevertheless it\\r\\nmay have been that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a\\r\\nfiery whaleman\\'s ways, altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the\\r\\nvoyage. Or at least if this were otherwise, there were not wanting other\\r\\nmotives much more influential with him. It would be refining too much, perhaps,\\r\\neven considering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the\\r\\nWhite Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm\\r\\nwhales, and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied\\r\\nthe chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the\\r\\nhated one he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable, there\\r\\nwere still additional considerations which, though not so strictly according\\r\\nwith the wildness of his ruling passion, yet were by no means incapable of\\r\\nswaying him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTo accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in the\\r\\nshadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew, for example,\\r\\nthat however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over Starbuck, yet\\r\\nthat ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere\\r\\ncorporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership; for to the purely\\r\\nspiritual, the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation.\\r\\nStarbuck\\'s body and Starbuck\\'s coerced will were Ahab\\'s, so long as Ahab kept\\r\\nhis magnet at Starbuck\\'s brain; still he knew that for all this the chief mate,\\r\\nin his soul, abhorred his captain\\'s quest, and could he, would joyfully\\r\\ndisintegrate himself from it, or even frustrate it. It might be that a long\\r\\ninterval would elapse ere the White Whale was seen. During that long interval\\r\\nStarbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his\\r\\ncaptain\\'s leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial\\r\\ninfluences were brought to bear upon him. Not only that, but the subtle\\r\\ninsanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested\\r\\nthan in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that, for the\\r\\npresent, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative\\r\\nimpiousness which naturally invested it; that the full terror of the voyage\\r\\nmust be kept withdrawn into the obscure background (for few men\\'s courage is\\r\\nproof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood\\r\\ntheir long night watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to\\r\\nthink of than Moby Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew\\r\\nhad hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are more\\r\\nor less capricious and unreliable\\xe2\\x80\\x94 they live in the varying outer weather, and\\r\\nthey inhale its fickleness\\xe2\\x80\\x94 and when retained for any object remote and blank\\r\\nin the pursuit, however promissory of life and passion in the end, it is above\\r\\nall things requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene\\r\\nand hold them healthily suspended for the final dash.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion mankind\\r\\ndisdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent. The permanent\\r\\nconstitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought Ahab, is sordidness.\\r\\nGranting that the White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew,\\r\\nand playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous\\r\\nknight-errantism in them, still, while for the love of it they give chase to\\r\\nMoby Dick, they must also have food for their more common, daily appetites. For\\r\\neven the high lifted and chivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to\\r\\ntraverse two thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without\\r\\ncommitting burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious perquisites by\\r\\nthe way. Had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\nthat final and romantic object, too many would have turned from in disgust. I\\r\\nwill not strip these men, thought Ahab, of all hopes of cash\\xe2\\x80\\x94aye, cash. They\\r\\nmay scorn cash now; but let some months go by, and no perspective promise of it\\r\\nto them, and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this\\r\\nsame cash would soon cashier Ahab.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to Ahab\\r\\npersonally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps somewhat\\r\\nprematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the Pequod\\'s voyage, Ahab\\r\\nwas now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he had indirectly laid himself\\r\\nopen to the unanswerable charge of usurpation; and with perfect impunity, both\\r\\nmoral and legal, his crew if so disposed, and to that end competent, could\\r\\nrefuse all further obedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the\\r\\ncommand. From even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible\\r\\nconsequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab must of\\r\\ncourse have been most anxious to protect himself. That protection could only\\r\\nconsist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand, backed by a heedful,\\r\\nclosely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence which it\\r\\nwas possible for his crew to be subjected to.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally\\r\\ndeveloped here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue\\r\\ntrue to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod\\'s voyage; observe all\\r\\ncustomary usages; and not only that, but force himself to evince all his well\\r\\nknown passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBe all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three\\r\\nmastheads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit\\r\\nreporting even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long without reward.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 47</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Mat-Maker\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging about the\\r\\ndecks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-colored waters. Queequeg and I\\r\\nwere mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat, for an additional\\r\\nlashing to our boat. So still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the\\r\\nscene, and such an incantation of revelry lurked in the air, that each silent\\r\\nsailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I kept\\r\\npassing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarns of\\r\\nthe warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as Queequeg, standing\\r\\nsideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads, and\\r\\nidly looking off upon the water, carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every\\r\\nyarn; I say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and\\r\\nall over the sea, only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that\\r\\nit seemed as if this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle\\r\\nmechanically weaving and weaving away at the Fates. There lay the fixed threads\\r\\nof the warp subject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging vibration,\\r\\nand that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of\\r\\nother threads with its own. This warp seemed necessity; and here, thought I,\\r\\nwith my own hand I ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these\\r\\nunalterable threads. Meantime, Queequeg\\'s impulsive, indifferent sword,\\r\\nsometimes hitting the woof slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as\\r\\nthe case might be; and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a\\r\\ncorresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric; this\\r\\nsavage\\'s sword, thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and\\r\\nwoof; this easy, indifferent sword must be chance\\xe2\\x80\\x94 aye, chance, free will, and\\r\\nnecessity\\xe2\\x80\\x94no wise incompatible\\xe2\\x80\\x94 all interweavingly working together. The\\r\\nstraight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its ultimate course\\xe2\\x80\\x94 its\\r\\nevery alternating vibration, indeed, only tending to that; free will still free\\r\\nto ply her shuttle between given threads; and chance, though restrained in its\\r\\nplay within the right lines of necessity, and sideways in its motions directed\\r\\nby free will, though thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either,\\r\\nand has the last featuring blow at events.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so strange,\\r\\nlong drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of free will\\r\\ndropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice\\r\\ndropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees was that mad Gay-Header,\\r\\nTashtego. His body was reaching eagerly forward, his hand stretched out like a\\r\\nwand, and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries. To be sure the same\\r\\nsound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds\\r\\nof whalemen\\'s look-outs perched as high in the air; but from few of those lungs\\r\\ncould that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from\\r\\nTashtego the Indian\\'s.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and eagerly\\r\\npeering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some prophet or seer\\r\\nbeholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries announcing their coming.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Where-away?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nInstantly all was commotion.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and reliable\\r\\nuniformity. And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other tribes of his\\r\\ngenus.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"There go flukes!\" was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales disappeared.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Quick, steward!\" cried Ahab. \"Time! time!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact minute to\\r\\nAhab.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling before\\r\\nit. Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward, we\\r\\nconfidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows. For that\\r\\nsingular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale when, sounding with his head\\r\\nin one direction, he nevertheless, while concealed beneath the surface, mills\\r\\naround, and swiftly swims off in the opposite quarter\\xe2\\x80\\x94this deceitfulness of his\\r\\ncould not now be in action; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish\\r\\nseen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our\\r\\nvicinity. One of the men selected for shipkeepers\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is, those not appointed\\r\\nto the boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the main-mast head. The\\r\\nsailors at the fore and mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed in their\\r\\nplaces; the cranes were thrust out; the mainyard was backed, and the three\\r\\nboats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs. Outside\\r\\nof the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail, while one\\r\\nfoot was expectantly poised on the gunwale. So look the long line of\\r\\nman-of-war\\'s men about to throw themselves on board an enemy\\'s ship.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye\\r\\nfrom the whale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was surrounded by\\r\\nfive dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 48</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe First Lowering\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side of the\\r\\ndeck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the tackles and bands\\r\\nof the boat which swung there. This boat had always been deemed one of the\\r\\nspare boats, though technically called the captain\\'s, on account of its hanging\\r\\nfrom the starboard quarter. The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and\\r\\nswart, with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips. A\\r\\nrumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black\\r\\ntrowsers of the same dark stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness was a\\r\\nglistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided and coiled round and\\r\\nround upon his head. Less swart in aspect, the companions of this figure were\\r\\nof that vivid, tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal\\r\\nnatives of the Manillas;\\xe2\\x80\\x94a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty,\\r\\nand by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret\\r\\nconfidential agents on the water of the devil, their lord, whose counting-room\\r\\nthey suppose to be elsewhere.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhile yet the wondering ship\\'s company were gazing upon these strangers,<br>\\r\\nAhab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head,<br>\\r\\n\"All ready there, Fedallah?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Ready,\" was the half-hissed reply.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Lower away then; d\\'ye hear?\" shouting across the deck.<br>\\r\\n\"Lower away there, I say.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSuch was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the men sprang\\r\\nover the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with a wallow, the\\r\\nthree boats dropped into the sea; while, with a dexterous, off-handed daring,\\r\\nunknown in any other vocation, the sailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling\\r\\nship\\'s side into the tossed boats below.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHardly had they pulled out from under the ship\\'s lee, when a fourth keel,\\r\\ncoming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and showed the\\r\\nfive strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the stern, loudly hailed\\r\\nStarbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves widely, so as to cover a large\\r\\nexpanse of water. But with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah\\r\\nand his crew, the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Captain Ahab?-\" said Starbuck.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Spread yourselves,\" cried Ahab; \"give way, all four boats.<br>\\r\\nThou, Flask, pull out more to leeward!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his great\\r\\nsteering oar. \"Lay back!\" addressing his crew. \"There!\\xe2\\x80\\x94there!\\xe2\\x80\\x94 there again!\\r\\nThere she blows right ahead, boys!\\xe2\\x80\\x94lay back!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t mind\\'em, sir,\" said Archy; \"I knew it all before now.<br>\\r\\nDidn\\'t I hear \\'em in the hold? And didn\\'t I tell Cabaco here of it?<br>\\r\\nWhat say ye, Cabaco? They are stowaways, Mr. Flask.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little ones,\"\\r\\ndrawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of whom still showed\\r\\nsigns of uneasiness. \"Why don\\'t you break your backbones, my boys? What is it\\r\\nyou stare at? Those chaps in yonder boat? Tut! They are only five more hands\\r\\ncome to help us never mind from where the more the merrier. Pull, then, do\\r\\npull; never mind the brimstone devils are good fellows enough. So, so; there\\r\\nyou are now; that\\'s the stroke for a thousand pounds; that\\'s the stroke to\\r\\nsweep the stakes! Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes! Three\\r\\ncheers, men\\xe2\\x80\\x94all hearts alive! Easy, easy; don\\'t be in a hurry\\xe2\\x80\\x94 don\\'t be in a\\r\\nhurry. Why don\\'t you snap your oars, you rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So,\\r\\nso, so, then:\\xe2\\x80\\x94softly, softly! That\\'s it\\xe2\\x80\\x94that\\'s it! long and strong. Give way\\r\\nthere, give way! The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are all\\r\\nasleep. Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull. Pull, will ye? pull, can\\'t ye?\\r\\npull, won\\'t ye? Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes don\\'t ye\\r\\npull?\\xe2\\x80\\x94pull and break something! pull, and start your eyes out! Here,\" whipping\\r\\nout the sharp knife from his girdle; \"every mother\\'s son of ye draw his knife,\\r\\nand pull with the blade between his teeth. That\\'s it\\xe2\\x80\\x94that\\'s it. Now ye do\\r\\nsomething; that looks like it, my steel-bits. Start her\\xe2\\x80\\x94 start her, my\\r\\nsilverspoons! Start her, marling-spikes!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nStubb\\'s exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had rather a\\r\\npeculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in inculcating the\\r\\nreligion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this specimen of his\\r\\nsermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions with his congregation.\\r\\nNot at all; and therein consisted his chief peculiarity. He would say the most\\r\\nterrific things to his crew, in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury,\\r\\nand the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman\\r\\ncould hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet\\r\\npulling for the mere joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy\\r\\nand indolent himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so broadly\\r\\ngaped\\xe2\\x80\\x94 open-mouthed at times\\xe2\\x80\\x94that the mere sight of such a yawning commander,\\r\\nby sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon the crew. Then again, Stubb\\r\\nwas one of those odd sort of humorists, whose jollity is sometimes so curiously\\r\\nambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely across\\r\\nStubb\\'s bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were pretty near to each\\r\\nother, Stubb hailed the mate.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye please!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Halloa!\" returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he spoke; still\\r\\nearnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set like a flint from\\r\\nStubb\\'s.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong, boys!)\"\\r\\nin a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: \"A sad business, Mr.\\r\\nStubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never mind, Mr. Stubb, all for\\r\\nthe best. Let all your crew pull strong, come what will. (Spring, my men,\\r\\nspring!) There\\'s hogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr. Stubb, and that\\'s what ye came\\r\\nfor. (Pull, my boys!) Sperm, sperm\\'s the play! This at least is duty; duty and\\r\\nprofit hand in hand.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Aye, aye, I thought as much,\" soliloquized Stubb, when the boats diverged, \"as\\r\\nsoon as I clapt eye on \\'em, I thought so. Aye, and that\\'s what he went into the\\r\\nafter hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long suspected. They were hidden down\\r\\nthere. The White Whale\\'s at the bottom of it. Well, well, so be it! Can\\'t be\\r\\nhelped! All right! Give way men! It ain\\'t the White Whale to-day! Give way!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the\\r\\nlowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably awakened a sort\\r\\nof superstitious amazement in some of the ship\\'s company; but Archy\\'s fancied\\r\\ndiscovery having some time previous got abroad among them, though indeed not\\r\\ncredited then, this had in some small measure prepared them for the event. It\\r\\ntook off the extreme edge of their wonder; and so what with all this and\\r\\nStubb\\'s confident way of accounting for their appearance, they were for the\\r\\ntime freed from superstitious surmisings; though the affair still left abundant\\r\\nroom for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab\\'s precise agency in the\\r\\nmatter from the beginning. For me, I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I\\r\\nhad seen creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn, as well as\\r\\nthe enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMeantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the furthest to\\r\\nwindward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a circumstance bespeaking\\r\\nhow potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed\\r\\nall steel and whalebone; like five trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular\\r\\nstrokes of strength, which periodically started the boat along the water like a\\r\\nhorizontal burst boiler out of a Mississippi steamer. As for Fedallah, who was\\r\\nseen pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and\\r\\ndisplayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale,\\r\\nclearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon; while at\\r\\nthe other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a fencer\\'s, thrown half\\r\\nbackward into the air, as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip; Ahab was\\r\\nseen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the\\r\\nWhite Whale had torn him. All at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar\\r\\nmotion and then remained fixed, while the boat\\'s five oars were seen\\r\\nsimultaneously peaked. Boat and crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly the\\r\\nthree spread boats in the rear paused on their way. The whales had irregularly\\r\\nsettled bodily down into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token\\r\\nof the movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Every man look out along his oars!\" cried Starbuck. \"Thou, Queequeg, stand\\r\\nup!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage stood\\r\\nerect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the spot where the\\r\\nchase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where\\r\\nit was also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale, Starbuck himself\\r\\nwas seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his\\r\\nchip of a craft, and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNot very far distant Flask\\'s boat was also lying breathlessly still; its\\r\\ncommander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a stout sort of\\r\\npost rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above the level of the stern\\r\\nplatform. It is used for catching turns with the whale line. Its top is not\\r\\nmore spacious than the palm of a man\\'s hand, and standing upon such a base as\\r\\nthat, Flask seemed perched at the mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all\\r\\nbut her trucks. But little King-Post was small and short, and at the same time\\r\\nlittle King-Post was full of a large and tall ambition, so that this logger\\r\\nhead stand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I can\\'t see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me onto that.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nUpon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way, swiftly\\r\\nslid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty shoulders for a\\r\\npedestal.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Good a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you fifty\\r\\nfeet taller.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat, the\\r\\ngigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to Flask\\'s foot, and\\r\\nthen putting Flask\\'s hand on his hearse-plumed head and bidding him spring as\\r\\nhe himself should toss, with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and\\r\\ndry on his shoulders. And here was Flask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted\\r\\narm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous\\r\\nhabitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in\\r\\nhis boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and\\r\\ncross-running seas. Still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the\\r\\nlogger head itself, under such circumstances. But the sight of little Flask\\r\\nmounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious; for sustaining himself with\\r\\na cool, indifferent, easy, unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to\\r\\nevery roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form. On his broad back,\\r\\nflaxen-haired Flask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the\\r\\nrider. Though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now\\r\\nand then stamp with impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby give to\\r\\nthe negro\\'s lordly chest. So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the living\\r\\nmagnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons for\\r\\nthat.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMeanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing solicitudes. The\\r\\nwhales might have made one of their regular soundings, not a temporary dive\\r\\nfrom mere fright; and if that were the case, Stubb, as his wont in such cases,\\r\\nit seems, was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe. He\\r\\nwithdrew it from his hatband, where he always wore it aslant like a feather. He\\r\\nloaded it, and rammed home the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly had he\\r\\nignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand, when Tashtego, his\\r\\nharpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars,\\r\\nsuddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat, crying out in\\r\\na quick phrensy of hurry, \"Down, down all, and give way!\\xe2\\x80\\x94there they are!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTo a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been visible at\\r\\nthat moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white water, and thin\\r\\nscattered puffs of vapor hovering over it, and suffusingly blowing off to\\r\\nleeward, like the confused scud from white rolling billows. The air around\\r\\nsuddenly vibrated and tingled, as it were, like the air over intensely heated\\r\\nplates of iron. Beneath this atmospheric waving and curling, and partially\\r\\nbeneath a thin layer of water, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance\\r\\nof all the other indications, the puffs of vapor they spouted, seemed their\\r\\nforerunning couriers and detached flying outriders.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAll four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and\\r\\nair. But it bade far to outstrip them; it flew on and on, as a mass of\\r\\ninterblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Pull, pull, my good boys,\" said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but intensest\\r\\nconcentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes\\r\\ndarted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two visible needles in two\\r\\nunerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much to his crew, though, nor did\\r\\nhis crew say anything to him. Only the silence of the boat was at intervals\\r\\nstartlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers, now harsh with command,\\r\\nnow soft with entreaty.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHow different the loud little King-Post. \"Sing out and say something, my\\r\\nhearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on their black\\r\\nbacks, boys; only do that for me, and I\\'ll sign over to you my Martha\\'s\\r\\nVineyard plantation, boys; including wife and children, boys. Lay me on\\xe2\\x80\\x94lay me\\r\\non! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring mad! See! see that white\\r\\nwater!\" And so shouting, he pulled his hat from his head, and stamped up and\\r\\ndown on it; then picking it up, flirted it far off upon the sea; and finally\\r\\nfell to rearing and plunging in the boat\\'s stern like a crazed colt from the\\r\\nprairie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Look at that chap now,\" philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his unlighted\\r\\nshort pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a short distance,\\r\\nfollowed after\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"He\\'s got fits, that Flask has. Fits? yes, give him fits\\xe2\\x80\\x94that\\'s\\r\\nthe very word\\xe2\\x80\\x94pitch fits into \\'em. Merrily, merrily, hearts-alive. Pudding for\\r\\nsupper, you know;\\xe2\\x80\\x94 merry\\'s the word. Pull, babes\\xe2\\x80\\x94pull, sucklings\\xe2\\x80\\x94pull, all. But\\r\\nwhat the devil are you hurrying about? Softly, softly, and steadily, my men.\\r\\nOnly pull, and keep pulling; nothing more. Crack all your backbones, and bite\\r\\nyour knives in two\\xe2\\x80\\x94that\\'s all. Take it easy\\xe2\\x80\\x94why don\\'t ye take it easy, I say,\\r\\nand burst all your livers and lungs!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of\\r\\nhis\\xe2\\x80\\x94these were words best omitted here; for you live under the blessed light of\\r\\nthe evangelical land. Only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give\\r\\near to such words, when, with tornado brow, and eyes of red murder, and\\r\\nfoam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMeanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allusions of Flask to\\r\\n\"that whale,\" as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be\\r\\nincessantly tantalizing his boat\\'s bow with its tail\\xe2\\x80\\x94these allusions of his\\r\\nwere at times so vivid and life-like, that they would cause some one or two of\\r\\nhis men to snatch a fearful look over his shoulder. But this was against all\\r\\nrule; for the oarsmen must put out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their\\r\\nnecks; usages announcing that they must have no organs but ears; and no limbs\\r\\nbut arms, in these critical moments.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the omnipotent\\r\\nsea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled along the eight\\r\\ngunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling-green; the brief suspended\\r\\nagony of the boat, as it would tip for an instant on the knife-like edge of the\\r\\nsharper waves, that almost seemed threatening to cut it in two; the sudden\\r\\nprofound dip into the watery glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings\\r\\nto gain the top of the opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down its\\r\\nother side;\\xe2\\x80\\x94all these, with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and the\\r\\nshuddering gasps of the oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod\\r\\nbearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her\\r\\nscreaming brood;\\xe2\\x80\\x94all this was thrilling. Not the raw recruit, marching from the\\r\\nbosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle; not the dead man\\'s\\r\\nghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the other world;\\xe2\\x80\\x94 neither of\\r\\nthese can feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the\\r\\nfirst time finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of the hunted\\r\\nsperm whale.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more\\r\\nvisible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows flung upon\\r\\nthe sea. The jets of vapor no longer blended, but tilted everywhere to right\\r\\nand left; the whales seemed separating their wakes. The boats were pulled more\\r\\napart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward. Our sail\\r\\nwas now set, and, with the still rising wind, we rushed along; the boat going\\r\\nwith such madness through the water, that the lee oars could scarcely be worked\\r\\nrapidly enough to escape being torn from the row-locks.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSoon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither ship nor\\r\\nboat to be seen.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Give way, men,\" whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the sheet of his\\r\\nsail; \"there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes. There\\'s white\\r\\nwater again!\\xe2\\x80\\x94close to! Spring!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSoon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that the\\r\\nother boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard, when with a\\r\\nlightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said: \"Stand up!\" and Queequeg,\\r\\nharpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThough not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so close\\r\\nto them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the mate in\\r\\nthe stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent instant had come; they\\r\\nheard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their\\r\\nlitter. Meanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist, the waves\\r\\ncurling and hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"That\\'s his hump. There, there, give it to him!\" whispered Starbuck.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron of\\r\\nQueequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from astern,\\r\\nwhile forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the sail collapsed and\\r\\nexploded; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by; something rolled and\\r\\ntumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole crew were half suffocated as\\r\\nthey were tossed helter-skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall.\\r\\nSquall, whale, and harpoon had all blended together; and the whale, merely\\r\\ngrazed by the iron, escaped.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThough completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming round it we\\r\\npicked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale, tumbled back\\r\\nto our places. There we sat up to our knees in the sea, the water covering\\r\\nevery rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft\\r\\nseemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers together; the\\r\\nwhole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white fire upon the\\r\\nprairie, in which unconsumed, we were burning; immortal in these jaws of death!\\r\\nIn vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar to the live coals down the\\r\\nchimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm. Meanwhile the\\r\\ndriving scud, rack, and mist, grew darker with the shadows of night; no sign of\\r\\nthe ship could be seen. The rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the\\r\\nboat. The oars were useless as propellers, performing now the office of\\r\\nlife-preservers. So, cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg, after\\r\\nmany failures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then\\r\\nstretching it on a waif pole, handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of\\r\\nthis forlorn hope. There, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle in the\\r\\nheart of that almighty forlornness. There, then, he sat, the sign and symbol of\\r\\na man without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat, we\\r\\nlifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. The mist still spread over the sea, the\\r\\nempty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat. Suddenly Queequeg started\\r\\nto his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear. We all heard a faint creaking, as\\r\\nof ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm. The sound came nearer and\\r\\nnearer; the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge, vague form. Affrighted, we\\r\\nall sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing right\\r\\ndown upon us within a distance of not much more than its length.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFloating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it tossed\\r\\nand gaped beneath the ship\\'s bows like a chip at the base of a cataract; and\\r\\nthen the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no more till it came up\\r\\nweltering astern. Again we swam for it, were dashed against it by the seas, and\\r\\nwere at last taken up and safely landed on board. Ere the squall came close to,\\r\\nthe other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good\\r\\ntime. The ship had given us up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light\\r\\nupon some token of our perishing,\\xe2\\x80\\x94 an oar or a lance pole.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 49</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Hyena\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we\\r\\ncall life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke,\\r\\nthough the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more than suspects that the\\r\\njoke is at nobody\\'s expense but his own. However, nothing dispirits, and\\r\\nnothing seems worth while disputing. He bolts down all events, all creeds, and\\r\\nbeliefs, and persuasions, all hard things visible and invisible, never mind how\\r\\nknobby; as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints.\\r\\nAnd as for small difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden disaster,\\r\\nperil of life and limb; all these, and death itself, seem to him only sly,\\r\\ngood-natured hits, and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and\\r\\nunaccountable old joker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking of, comes\\r\\nover a man only in some time of extreme tribulation; it comes in the very midst\\r\\nof his earnestness, so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing\\r\\nmost momentous, now seems but a part of the general joke. There is nothing like\\r\\nthe perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial, desperado\\r\\nphilosophy; and with it I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod, and the\\r\\ngreat White Whale its object.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Queequeg,\" said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the deck, and I\\r\\nwas still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water; \"Queequeg, my\\r\\nfine friend, does this sort of thing often happen?\" Without much emotion,\\r\\nthough soaked through just like me, he gave me to understand that such things\\r\\ndid often happen.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Mr. Stubb,\" said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his\\r\\noil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; \"Mr. Stubb, I think I\\r\\nhave heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief mate, Mr.\\r\\nStarbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent. I suppose then, that going\\r\\nplump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a\\r\\nwhaleman\\'s discretion?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Certain. I\\'ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off Cape Horn.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Mr. Flask,\" said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing close by;\\r\\n\"you are experienced in these things, and I am not. Will you tell me whether it\\r\\nis an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr. Flask, for an oarsman to break his\\r\\nown back pulling himself back-foremost into death\\'s jaws?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Can\\'t you twist that smaller?\" said Flask. \"Yes, that\\'s the law. I should like\\r\\nto see a boat\\'s crew backing water up to a whale face foremost. Ha, ha! the\\r\\nwhale would give them squint for squint, mind that!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHere then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement of the\\r\\nentire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings in the water\\r\\nand consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of common occurrence in this\\r\\nkind of life; considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going\\r\\non to the whale I must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the\\r\\nboat\\xe2\\x80\\x94 oftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon\\r\\nthe point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings; considering\\r\\nthat the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be\\r\\nimputed to Starbuck\\'s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall,\\r\\nand considering that Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his great\\r\\nheedfulness in the fishery; considering that I belonged to this uncommonly\\r\\nprudent Starbuck\\'s boat; and finally considering in what a devil\\'s chase I was\\r\\nimplicated, touching the White Whale: taking all things together, I say, I\\r\\nthought I might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will. \"Queequeg,\"\\r\\nsaid I, \"come along, you shall be my lawyer, executor, and legatee.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their last\\r\\nwills and testaments, but there are no people in the world more fond of that\\r\\ndiversion.

After the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion, I felt\\r\\nall the easier; a stone was rolled away from my heart. Besides, all the days I\\r\\nshould now live would be as good as the days that Lazarus lived after his\\r\\nresurrection; a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case\\r\\nmay be.

Oh! he\\'s a wonderful old man!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I don\\'t think it so strange, after all, on that account,\" said Flask. \"If his\\r\\nleg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different thing. That would disable\\r\\nhim; but he has one knee, and good part of the other left, you know.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAmong whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering the\\r\\nparamount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it is right for\\r\\na whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase. So\\r\\nTamerlane\\'s soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes, whether that\\r\\ninvaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Considering that with two\\r\\nlegs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger; considering that the\\r\\npursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties; that\\r\\nevery individual moment, indeed, then comprises a peril; under these\\r\\ncircumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt?\\r\\nAs a general thing, the joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought\\r\\nnot.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAhab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his\\r\\nentering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase,\\r\\nfor the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person,\\r\\nyet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular\\r\\nheadsman in the hunt\\xe2\\x80\\x94above all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra\\r\\nmen, as that same boat\\'s crew, he well knew that such generous conceits never\\r\\nentered the heads of the owners of the Pequod. Therefore he had not solicited a\\r\\nboat\\'s crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head.\\r\\nNevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter.\\r\\nUntil Cabaco\\'s published discovery, the sailors had little foreseen it, though\\r\\nto be sure when, after being a little while out of port, all hands had\\r\\nconcluded the customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service; when\\r\\nsome time after this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the\\r\\nmatter of making thole-pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one\\r\\nof the spare boats, and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers,\\r\\nwhich when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when\\r\\nall this was observed in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an\\r\\nextra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better\\r\\nwithstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety he\\r\\nevinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is sometimes\\r\\ncalled, the horizontal piece in the boat\\'s bow for bracing the knee against in\\r\\ndarting or stabbing at the whale; when it was observed how often he stood up in\\r\\nthat boat with his solitary knee fixed in the semi-circular depression in the\\r\\ncleat, and with the carpenter\\'s chisel gouged out a little here and\\r\\nstraightened it a little there; all these things, I say, had awakened much\\r\\ninterest and curiosity at the time. But almost everybody supposed that this\\r\\nparticular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the\\r\\nultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he had already revealed his intention to hunt\\r\\nthat mortal monster in person. But such a supposition did by no means involve\\r\\nthe remotest suspicion as to any boat\\'s crew being assigned to that boat.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned away; for\\r\\nin a whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now and then such unaccountable odds\\r\\nand ends of strange nations come up from the unknown nooks and ash-holes of the\\r\\nearth to man these floating outlaws of whalers; and the ships themselves often\\r\\npick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on\\r\\nplanks, bits of wreck, oars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and\\r\\nwhat not; that Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the\\r\\ncabin to chat with the captain, and it would not create any unsubduable\\r\\nexcitement in the forecastle.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms\\r\\nsoon found their place among the crew, though still as it were somehow distinct\\r\\nfrom them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the\\r\\nlast. Whence he came in a mannerly world like this, by what sort of\\r\\nunaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with Ahab\\'s peculiar\\r\\nfortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort of a half-hinted influence; Heaven\\r\\nknows, but it might have been even authority over him; all this none knew. But\\r\\none cannot sustain an indifferent air concerning Fedallah. He was such a\\r\\ncreature as civilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their\\r\\ndreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom now and then glide among the\\r\\nunchanging Asiatic communities, especially the Oriental isles to the east of\\r\\nthe continent\\xe2\\x80\\x94 those insulated, immemorial, unalterable countries, which even\\r\\nin these modern days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of\\r\\nearth\\'s primal generations, when the memory of the first man was a distinct\\r\\nrecollection, and all men his descendants, unknowing whence he came, eyed each\\r\\nother as real phantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created\\r\\nand to what end; when though, according to Genesis, the angels indeed consorted\\r\\nwith the daughters of men, the devils also, add the uncanonical Robbins,\\r\\nindulged in mundane amours.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 51</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Spirit-Spout\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDays, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly swept\\r\\nacross four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off the Cape de\\r\\nVerdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of the Rio de la Plata;\\r\\nand the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery locality, southerly from St. Helena.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight\\r\\nnight, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver; and, by their soft,\\r\\nsuffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery silence, not a solitude; on\\r\\nsuch a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles\\r\\nat the bow. Lit up by the moon, it looked celestial; seemed some plumed and\\r\\nglittering god uprising from the sea. Fedallah first descried this jet. For of\\r\\nthese moonlight nights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and\\r\\nstand a look-out there, with the same precision as if it had been day. And yet,\\r\\nthough herds of whales were seen by night, not one whaleman in a hundred would\\r\\nventure a lowering for them. You may think with what emotions, then, the seamen\\r\\nbeheld this old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours; his turban and\\r\\nthe moon, companions in one sky. But when, after spending his uniform interval\\r\\nthere for several successive nights without uttering a single sound; when,\\r\\nafter all this silence, his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery,\\r\\nmoon-lit jet, every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged\\r\\nspirit had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew. \"There she\\r\\nblows!\" Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered more; yet\\r\\nstill they felt no terror; rather pleasure. For though it was a most unwonted\\r\\nhour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously exciting, that almost\\r\\nevery soul on board instinctively desired a lowering.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWalking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the t\\'gallant\\r\\nsails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread. The best man in the ship\\r\\nmust take the helm. Then, with every mast-head manned, the piled-up craft\\r\\nrolled down before the wind. The strange, upheaving, lifting tendency of the\\r\\ntaffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many sails, made the buoyant,\\r\\nhovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet; while still she rushed along,\\r\\nas if two antagonistic influences were struggling in her\\xe2\\x80\\x94one to mount direct to\\r\\nheaven, the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal. And had you\\r\\nwatched Ahab\\'s face that night, you would have thought that in him also two\\r\\ndifferent things were warring. While his one live leg made lively echoes along\\r\\nthe deck, every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin-tap. On life and\\r\\ndeath this old man walked. But though the ship so swiftly sped, and though from\\r\\nevery eye, like arrows, the eager glances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more\\r\\nseen that night. Every sailor swore he saw it once, but not a second time.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThis midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days after,\\r\\nlo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced: again it was descried by\\r\\nall; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it disappeared as if it had\\r\\nnever been. And so it served us night after night, till no one heeded it but to\\r\\nwonder at it. Mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight, or starlight, as\\r\\nthe case might be; disappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or three;\\r\\nand somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further\\r\\nand further in our van, this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance with the\\r\\npreternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested the Pequod, were\\r\\nthere wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried;\\r\\nat however remote times, or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes, that\\r\\nunnearable spout was cast by one selfsame whale; and that whale, Moby Dick. For\\r\\na time, there reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting\\r\\napparition, as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that\\r\\nthe monster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest and\\r\\nmost savage seas.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThese temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a wondrous\\r\\npotency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in which, beneath all its\\r\\nblue blandness, some thought there lurked a devilish charm, as for days and\\r\\ndays we voyaged along, through seas so wearily, lonesomely mild, that all\\r\\nspace, in repugnance to our vengeful errand, seemed vacating itself of life\\r\\nbefore our urn-like prow.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began howling around\\r\\nus, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas that are there; when the\\r\\nivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast, and gored the dark waves in her\\r\\nmadness, till, like showers of silver chips, the foamflakes flew over her\\r\\nbulwarks; then all this desolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place to\\r\\nsights more dismal than before.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nClose to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before\\r\\nus; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And every morning,\\r\\nperched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and spite of our hootings,\\r\\nfor a long time obstinately clung to the hemp, as though they deemed our ship\\r\\nsome drifting, uninhabited craft; a thing appointed to desolation, and\\r\\ntherefore fit roosting-place for their homeless selves. And heaved and heaved,\\r\\nstill unrestingly heaved the black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience;\\r\\nand the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and\\r\\nsuffering it had bred.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape Tormentoto, as called of yore;\\r\\nfor long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended us, we\\r\\nfound ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where guilty beings\\r\\ntransformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed condemned to swim on\\r\\neverlastingly without any haven in store, or beat that black air without any\\r\\nhorizon. But calm, snow-white, and unvarying; still directing its fountain of\\r\\nfeathers to the sky; still beckoning us on from before, the solitary jet would\\r\\nat times be descried.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDuring all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for the time\\r\\nthe almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck, manifested the\\r\\ngloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever addressed his mates. In\\r\\ntempestuous times like these, after everything above and aloft has been\\r\\nsecured, nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale.\\r\\nThen Captain and crew become practical fatalists. So, with his ivory leg\\r\\ninserted into its accustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud,\\r\\nAhab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an\\r\\noccasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes\\r\\ntogether. Meantime, the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the\\r\\nperilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows, stood in a line along the\\r\\nbulwarks in the waist; and the better to guard against the leaping waves, each\\r\\nman had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he\\r\\nswung as in a loosened belt. Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship,\\r\\nas if manned by painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through all the\\r\\nswift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves. By night the same muteness of\\r\\nhumanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed; still in silence the men\\r\\nswung in the bowlines; still wordless Ahab stood up to the blast. Even when\\r\\nwearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his\\r\\nhammock. Never could Starbuck forget the old man\\'s aspect, when one night going\\r\\ndown into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood, he saw him with closed\\r\\neyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair; the rain and half-melted\\r\\nsleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged, still slowly\\r\\ndripping from the unremoved hat and coat. On the table beside him lay unrolled\\r\\none of those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken of.\\r\\nHis lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand. Though the body was erect,\\r\\nthe head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the\\r\\nneedle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in the ceiling.*\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n*The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to the\\r\\ncompass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself of the course\\r\\nof the ship.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTerrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this gale, still\\r\\nthou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 52</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Albatross\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSouth-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good cruising ground\\r\\nfor Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney (Albatross) by name. As she\\r\\nslowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the fore-mast-head, I had a good view\\r\\nof that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries\\xe2\\x80\\x94 a whaler at\\r\\nsea, and long absent from home.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the skeleton of\\r\\na stranded walrus. All down her sides, this spectral appearance was traced with\\r\\nlong channels of reddened rust, while all her spars and her rigging were like\\r\\nthe thick branches of trees furred over with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails\\r\\nwere set. A wild sight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three\\r\\nmast-heads. They seemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the\\r\\nraiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops\\r\\nnailed to the mast, they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and though,\\r\\nwhen the ship slowly glided close under our stern, we six men in the air came\\r\\nso nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of\\r\\none ship to those of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking fishermen, mildly\\r\\neyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our own look-outs, while the\\r\\nquarter-deck hail was being heard from below.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Ship ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in the act of\\r\\nputting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his hand into the sea;\\r\\nand the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to make himself heard without\\r\\nit. Meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between us. While in\\r\\nvarious silent ways the seamen of the Pequod were evincing their observance of\\r\\nthis ominous incident at the first mere mention of the White Whale\\'s name to\\r\\nanother ship, Ahab for a moment paused; it almost seemed as though he would\\r\\nhave lowered a boat to board the stranger, had not the threatening wind\\r\\nforbade. But taking advantage of his windward position, he again seized his\\r\\ntrumpet, and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer\\r\\nand shortly bound home, he loudly hailed\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Ahoy there! This is the Pequod, bound\\r\\nround the world! Tell them to address all future letters to the Pacific ocean!\\r\\nand this time three years, if I am not at home, tell them to address them to-\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then, in\\r\\naccordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish, that for\\r\\nsome days before had been placidly swimming by our side, darted away with what\\r\\nseemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves fore and aft with the stranger\\'s\\r\\nflanks. Though in the course of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before\\r\\nhave noticed a similar sight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles\\r\\ncapriciously carry meanings.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Swim away from me, do ye?\" murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water. There\\r\\nseemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless\\r\\nsadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced. But turning to the\\r\\nsteersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her\\r\\nheadway, he cried out in his old lion voice,\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Up helm! Keep her off round the\\r\\nworld!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nRound the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings; but\\r\\nwhereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through numberless perils\\r\\nto the very point whence we started, where those that we left behind secure,\\r\\nwere all the time before us.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWere this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for ever\\r\\nreach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange than any\\r\\nCyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise in the voyage. But\\r\\nin pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in tormented chase of that\\r\\ndemon phantom that, some time or other, swims before all human hearts; while\\r\\nchasing such over this round globe, they either lead us on in barren mazes or\\r\\nmidway leave us whelmed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 53</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Gam\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken\\r\\nwas this: the wind and sea betokened storms. But even had this not been the\\r\\ncase, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded her\\xe2\\x80\\x94judging by his\\r\\nsubsequent conduct on similar occasions\\xe2\\x80\\x94if so it had been that, by the process\\r\\nof hailing, he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put. For, as\\r\\nit eventually turned out, he cared not to consort, even for five minutes, with\\r\\nany stranger captain, except he could contribute some of that information he so\\r\\nabsorbingly sought. But all this might remain inadequately estimated, were not\\r\\nsomething said here of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each\\r\\nother in foreign seas, and especially on a common cruising-ground.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIf two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the equally\\r\\ndesolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering each other in\\r\\nsuch inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of them, cannot well avoid a\\r\\nmutual salutation; and stopping for a moment to interchange the news; and,\\r\\nperhaps, sitting down for a while and resting in concert: then, how much more\\r\\nnatural that upon the illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea,\\r\\ntwo whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth\\xe2\\x80\\x94off lone\\r\\nFanning\\'s Island, or the far away King\\'s Mills; how much more natural, I say,\\r\\nthat under such circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails,\\r\\nbut come into still closer, more friendly and sociable contact. And especially\\r\\nwould this seem to be a matter of course, in the case of vessels owned in one\\r\\nseaport, and whose captains, officers, and not a few of the men are personally\\r\\nknown to each other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things\\r\\nto talk about.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters on board;\\r\\nat any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or\\r\\ntwo later than the last one on her blurred and thumb-worn files. And in return\\r\\nfor that courtesy, the outward-bound ship would receive the latest whaling\\r\\nintelligence from the cruising-ground to which she may be destined, a thing of\\r\\nthe utmost importance to her. And in degree, all this will hold true concerning\\r\\nwhaling vessels crossing each other\\'s track on the cruising-ground itself, even\\r\\nthough they are equally long absent from home. For one of them may have\\r\\nreceived a transfer of letters from some third, and now far remote vessel; and\\r\\nsome of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets. Besides,\\r\\nthey would exchange the whaling news, and have an agreeable chat. For not only\\r\\nwould they meet with all the sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the\\r\\npeculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared\\r\\nprivations and perils.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor would difference of country make any very essential difference; that is, so\\r\\nlong as both parties speak one language, as is the case with Americans and\\r\\nEnglish. Though, to be sure, from the small number of English whalers, such\\r\\nmeetings do not very often occur, and when they do occur there. is too apt to\\r\\nbe a sort of shyness between them; for your Englishman is rather reserved, and\\r\\nyour Yankee, he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself.\\r\\nBesides, the English whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan\\r\\nsuperiority over the American whalers; regarding the long, lean Nantucketer,\\r\\nwith his nondescript provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But where this\\r\\nsuperiority in the English whaleman does really consist, it would be hard to\\r\\nsay, seeing that the Yankees in one day, collectively, kill more whales than\\r\\nall the English, collectively, in ten years. But this is a harmless little\\r\\nfoible in the English whale-hunters, which the Nantucketer does not take much\\r\\nto heart; probably, because he knows that he has a few foibles himself.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the whalers have\\r\\nmost reason to be sociable\\xe2\\x80\\x94and they are so. Whereas, some merchant ships\\r\\ncrossing each other\\'s wake in the mid-Atlantic, will oftentimes pass on without\\r\\nso much as a single word of recognition, mutually cutting each other on the\\r\\nhigh seas, like a brace of dandies in Broadway; and all the time indulging,\\r\\nperhaps, in finical criticism upon each other\\'s rig. As for Men-of-War, when\\r\\nthey chance to meet at sea, they first go through such a string of silly\\r\\nbowings and scrapings, such a ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to\\r\\nbe much right-down hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all. As\\r\\ntouching Slave-ships meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry, they\\r\\nrun away from each other as soon as possible. And as for Pirates, when they\\r\\nchance to cross each other\\'s cross-bones, the first hail is\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"How many skulls?\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\nthe same way that whalers hail\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"How many barrels?\" And that question once\\r\\nanswered, pirates straightway steer apart, for they are infernal villains on\\r\\nboth sides, and don\\'t like to see overmuch of each other\\'s villanous\\r\\nlikenesses.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,\\r\\nfree-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in\\r\\nany sort of decent weather? She has a \"Gam,\" a thing so utterly unknown to all\\r\\nother ships that they never heard of the name even; and if by chance they\\r\\nshould hear of it, they only grin at it, and repeat gamesome stuff about\\r\\n\"spouters\" and \"blubber-boilers,\" and such like pretty exclamations. Why it is\\r\\nthat all Merchant-seamen, and also all Pirates and Man-of-War\\'s men, and\\r\\nSlave-ship sailors, cherish such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this\\r\\nis a question it would be hard to answer. Because, in the case of pirates, say,\\r\\nI should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory\\r\\nabout it. It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at the\\r\\ngallows. And besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion, he has no\\r\\nproper foundation for his superior altitude. Hence, I conclude, that in\\r\\nboasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman, in that assertion the\\r\\npirate has no solid basis to stand on.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut what is a Gam? You might wear out your index-finger running up and down the\\r\\ncolumns of dictionaries, and never find the word, Dr. Johnson never attained to\\r\\nthat erudition; Noah Webster\\'s ark does not hold it. Nevertheless, this same\\r\\nexpressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen\\r\\nthousand true born Yankees. Certainly, it needs a definition, and should be\\r\\nincorporated into the Lexicon. With that view, let me learnedly define it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nGAM. NOUN\\xe2\\x80\\x94A social meeting of two (or more) Whaleships, generally on a\\r\\ncruising-ground; when, after exchanging hails, they exchange visits by boats\\'\\r\\ncrews, the two captains remaining, for the time, on board of one ship, and the\\r\\ntwo chief mates on the other.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten here.\\r\\nAll professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so has the whale\\r\\nfishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the captain is rowed\\r\\nanywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable,\\r\\nsometimes cushioned seat there, and often steers himself with a pretty little\\r\\nmilliner\\'s tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons. But the whale-boat has\\r\\nno seat astern, no sofa of that sort whatever, and no tiller at all. High times\\r\\nindeed, if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty\\r\\nold aldermen in patent chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never admits\\r\\nof any such effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat\\'s crew must\\r\\nleave the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number,\\r\\nthat subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and the captain, having no\\r\\nplace to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree. And\\r\\noften you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible\\r\\nworld resting on him from the sides of the two ships, this standing captain is\\r\\nall alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs.\\r\\nNor is this any very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting\\r\\nsteering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the after-oar\\r\\nreciprocating by rapping his knees in front. He is thus completely wedged\\r\\nbefore and behind, and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his\\r\\nstretched legs; but a sudden, violent pitch of the boat will often go far to\\r\\ntopple him, because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding\\r\\nbreadth. Merely make a spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up.\\r\\nThen, again, it would never do in plain sight of the world\\'s riveted eyes, it\\r\\nwould never do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself\\r\\nthe slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands; indeed, as\\r\\ntoken of his entire, buoyant self-command, he generally carries his hands in\\r\\nhis trowsers\\' pockets; but perhaps being generally very large, heavy hands, he\\r\\ncarries them there for ballast. Nevertheless there have occurred instances,\\r\\nwell authenticated ones too, where the captain has been known for an uncommonly\\r\\ncritical moment or two, in a sudden squall say\\xe2\\x80\\x94to seize hold of the nearest\\r\\noarsman\\'s hair, and hold on there like grim death.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 54</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Town-Ho\\'s Story\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n(As told at the Golden Inn)\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there, is much\\r\\nlike some noted four corners of a great highway, where you meet more travellers\\r\\nthan in any other part.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was not very long after speaking the Goney that another homeward-bound\\r\\nwhaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered. She was manned almost wholly by\\r\\nPolynesians. In the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of Moby Dick.\\r\\nTo some the general interest in the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a\\r\\ncircumstance of the Town-Ho\\'s story, which seemed obscurely to involve with the\\r\\nwhale a certain wondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called\\r\\njudgments of God which at times are said to overtake some men. This latter\\r\\ncircumstance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming what may be\\r\\ncalled the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated, never reached the\\r\\nears of Captain Ahab or his mates. For that secret part of the story was\\r\\nunknown to the captain of the Town-Ho himself. It was the private property of\\r\\nthree confederate white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems,\\r\\ncommunicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy, but the\\r\\nfollowing night Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and revealed so much of it in\\r\\nthat way, that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest.\\r\\nNevertheless, so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the\\r\\nPequod who came to the full knowledge of it, and by such a strange delicacy, to\\r\\ncall it so, were they governed in this matter, that they kept the secret among\\r\\nthemselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod\\'s main-mast.\\r\\nInterweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly\\r\\nnarrated on the ship, the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on\\r\\nlasting record.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n*The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head, still\\r\\nused by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor my humor\\'s sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated it at\\r\\nLima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one saint\\'s eve, smoking upon\\r\\nthe thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden Inn. Of those fine cavaliers, the\\r\\nyoung Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were on the closer terms with me; and hence\\r\\nthe interluding questions they occasionally put, and which are duly answered at\\r\\nthe time.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about\\r\\nrehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket, was\\r\\ncruising in your Pacific here, not very many days\\' sail eastward from the eaves\\r\\nof this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the northward of the Line. One\\r\\nmorning upon handling the pumps according to daily usage, it was observed that\\r\\nshe made more water in her hold than common. They supposed a sword-fish had\\r\\nstabbed her, gentlemen. But the captain, having some unusual reason for\\r\\nbelieving that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes; and therefore\\r\\nbeing very averse to quit them, and the leak not being then considered at all\\r\\ndangerous, though, indeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as\\r\\nlow down as was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued her\\r\\ncruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals; but no\\r\\ngood luck came; more days went by and not only was the leak yet undiscovered,\\r\\nbut it sensibly increased. So much so, that now taking some alarm, the captain,\\r\\nmaking all sail, stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands, there to\\r\\nhave his hull hove out and repaired.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance favoured,\\r\\nhe did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way, because his\\r\\npumps were of the best, and being periodically relieved at them, those\\r\\nsix-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free; never mind if the\\r\\nleak should double on her. In truth, well nigh the whole of this passage being\\r\\nattended by very prosperous breezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived\\r\\nin perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality, had\\r\\nit not been for the brutal overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and\\r\\nthe bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado from\\r\\nBuffalo.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Lakeman!\\xe2\\x80\\x94Buffalo! Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?\\' said Don\\r\\nSebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but\\xe2\\x80\\x94I crave your courtesy\\xe2\\x80\\x94may be,\\r\\nyou shall soon hear further of all that. Now, gentlemen, in square-sail brigs\\r\\nand three-masted ships, well nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed\\r\\nout of your old Callao to far Manilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart\\r\\nof our America, had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting\\r\\nimpressions popularly connected with the open ocean. For in their interflowing\\r\\naggregate, those grand fresh-water seas of ours,\\xe2\\x80\\x94Erie, and Ontario, and Huron,\\r\\nand Superior, and Michigan,\\xe2\\x80\\x94 possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many of\\r\\nthe ocean\\'s noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of\\r\\nclimes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles, even as the\\r\\nPolynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by two great contrasting\\r\\nnations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long maritime approaches to our\\r\\nnumerous territorial colonies from the East, dotted all round their banks; here\\r\\nand there are frowned upon by batteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of\\r\\nlofty Mackinaw; they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories; at\\r\\nintervals, they yield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces\\r\\nflash from out their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by\\r\\nancient and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines\\r\\nof kings in Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of\\r\\nprey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors;\\r\\nthey mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland, as well as Winnebago\\r\\nvillages; they float alike the full-rigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of\\r\\nthe State, the steamer, and the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and\\r\\ndismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what\\r\\nshipwrecks are, for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned\\r\\nfull many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gentlemen, though\\r\\nan inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean nurtured; as much of\\r\\nan audacious mariner as any. And for Radney, though in his infancy he may have\\r\\nlaid him down on the lone Nantucket beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though\\r\\nin after life he had long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative\\r\\nPacific; yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the\\r\\nbackwoods seaman, fresh from the latitudes of buckhorn handled Bowie-knives.\\r\\nYet was this Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman,\\r\\na mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible firmness,\\r\\nonly tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest\\r\\nslave\\'s right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had long been retained harmless and\\r\\ndocile. At all events, he had proved so thus far; but Radney was doomed and\\r\\nmade mad, and Steelkilt\\xe2\\x80\\x94but, gentlemen, you shall hear.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for\\r\\nher island haven, that the Town-Ho\\'s leak seemed again increasing, but only so\\r\\nas to require an hour or more at the pumps every day. You must know that in a\\r\\nsettled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic, for example, some skippers think\\r\\nlittle of pumping their whole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night,\\r\\nshould the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the\\r\\nprobability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it,\\r\\non account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom. Nor in the solitary and\\r\\nsavage seas far from you to the westward, gentlemen, is it altogether unusual\\r\\nfor ships to keep clanging at their pump-handles in full chorus even for a\\r\\nvoyage of considerable length! that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible\\r\\ncoast, or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only when a\\r\\nleaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters, some really\\r\\nlandless latitude, that her captain begins to feel a little anxious.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was found gaining\\r\\nonce more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her\\r\\ncompany; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded the upper sails to be well\\r\\nhoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way expanded to the breeze. Now this\\r\\nRadney, I suppose, was as little of a coward, and as little inclined to any\\r\\nsort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless,\\r\\nunthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine,\\r\\ngentlemen. Therefore when he betrayed this imagine, solicitude about the safety\\r\\nof the ship, some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his\\r\\nbeing a part owner in her. So when they were working that evening at the pumps,\\r\\nthere was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they\\r\\nstood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water; clear\\r\\nas any mountain spring, gentlemen\\xe2\\x80\\x94that bubbling from the pumps ran across the\\r\\ndeck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper-holes.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of\\r\\nours\\xe2\\x80\\x94watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in command over his\\r\\nfellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general\\r\\npride of manhood, straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable\\r\\ndislike and bitterness; and if he had a chance he will pull down and pulverize\\r\\nthat subaltern\\'s tower, and make a little heap of dust of it. Be this conceit\\r\\nof mine as it may, gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble\\r\\nanimal with a head like a Roman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled\\r\\nhousings of your last viceroy\\'s snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and\\r\\na soul in him, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he been\\r\\nborn son to Charlemagne\\'s father. But Radney, the mate, was ugly as a mule; yet\\r\\nas hardy, as stubborn, as malicious. He did not love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt\\r\\nknew it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest, the\\r\\nLakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with his gay\\r\\nbanterings.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Aye, aye, my merry lads, it\\'s a lively leak this; hold a cannikin, one of ye,\\r\\nand let\\'s have a taste. By the Lord, it\\'s worth bottling! I tell ye what, men,\\r\\nold Rad\\'s investment must go for it! he had best cut away his part of the hull\\r\\nand tow it home. The fact is, boys, that sword-fish only began the job; he\\'s\\r\\ncome back again with a gang of ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and\\r\\nwhat not; and the whole posse of \\'em are now hard at work cutting and slashing\\r\\nat the bottom; making improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I\\'d\\r\\ntell him to jump overboard and scatter \\'em. They\\'re playing the devil with his\\r\\nestate, I can tell him. But he\\'s a simple old soul,\\xe2\\x80\\x94Rad, and a beauty too.\\r\\nBoys, they say the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses. I\\r\\nwonder if he\\'d give a poor devil like me the model of his nose.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Damn your eyes! what\\'s that pump stopping for?\\' roared Radney, pretending not\\r\\nto have heard the sailors\\' talk. \\'Thunder away at it!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Aye, aye, sir,\\' said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. \\'Lively, boys, lively,\\r\\nnow!\\' And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines; the men tossed\\r\\ntheir hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard\\r\\nwhich denotes the fullest tension of life\\'s utmost energies.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went forward\\r\\nall panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face fiery red, his eyes\\r\\nbloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow. Now what cozening fiend\\r\\nit was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney to meddle with such a man in that\\r\\ncorporeally exasperated state, I know not; but so it happened. Intolerably\\r\\nstriding along the deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down\\r\\nthe planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent\\r\\nupon allowing a pig to run at large.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship\\'s deck at sea is a piece of household work\\r\\nwhich in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening; it\\r\\nhas been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time.\\r\\nSuch, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of\\r\\nneatness in seamen; some of whom would not willingly drown without first\\r\\nwashing their faces. But in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive\\r\\nprovince of the boys, if boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men\\r\\nin the Town-Ho that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and\\r\\nbeing the most athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly\\r\\nassigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should have been freed\\r\\nfrom any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being\\r\\nthe case with his comrades. I mention all these particulars so that you may\\r\\nunderstand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as plainly\\r\\nmeant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat in his face. Any\\r\\nman who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand this; and all this and\\r\\ndoubtless much more, the Lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his\\r\\ncommand. But as he sat still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into\\r\\nthe mate\\'s malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in\\r\\nhim and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he instinctively\\r\\nsaw all this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper\\r\\npassionateness in any already ireful being\\xe2\\x80\\x94a repugnance most felt, when felt at\\r\\nall, by really valiant men even when aggrieved\\xe2\\x80\\x94 this nameless phantom feeling,\\r\\ngentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion\\r\\nhe was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not\\r\\nhis business, and he would not do it. And then, without at all alluding to the\\r\\nshovel, he pointed to three lads, as the customary sweepers; who, not being\\r\\nbilleted at the pumps, had done little or nothing all day. To this, Radney\\r\\nreplied, with an oath, in a most domineering and outrageous manner\\r\\nunconditionally reiterating his command; meanwhile advancing upon the still\\r\\nseated Lakeman, with an uplifted cooper\\'s club hammer which he had snatched\\r\\nfrom a cask near by.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for all his\\r\\nfirst nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt could but ill\\r\\nbrook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still smothering the conflagration\\r\\nwithin him, without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat, till at\\r\\nlast the incensed Radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face,\\r\\nfuriously commanding him to do his bidding.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily followed by\\r\\nthe mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated his intention not to\\r\\nobey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had not the slightest effect, by an\\r\\nawful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the\\r\\nfoolish and infatuated man; but it was to no purpose. And in this way the two\\r\\nwent once slowly round the windlass; when, resolved at last no longer to\\r\\nretreat, bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his\\r\\nhumor, the Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to yourself.\\'\\r\\nBut the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where the Lakeman stood\\r\\nfixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth; meanwhile\\r\\nrepeating a string of insufferable maledictions. Retreating not the thousandth\\r\\npart of an inch; stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his\\r\\nglance, Steelkilt, clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing\\r\\nit back, told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he\\r\\n(Steelkilt) would murder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the\\r\\nslaughter by the gods. Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next\\r\\ninstant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch\\r\\nspouting blood like a whale.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays leading\\r\\nfar aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their mastheads. They were\\r\\nboth Canallers.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Canallers!\\' cried Don Pedro. \\'We have seen many whaleships in our harbors,\\r\\nbut never heard of your Canallers. Pardon: who and what are they?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand<br>\\r\\nErie Canal. You must have heard of it.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and hereditary land, we\\r\\nknow but little of your vigorous North.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Aye?

Your chicha\\'s very fine; and ere\\r\\nproceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for such information\\r\\nmay throw side-light upon my story.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire breadth of\\r\\nthe state of New York; through numerous populous cities and most thriving\\r\\nvillages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and affluent, cultivated\\r\\nfields, unrivalled for fertility; by billiard-room and bar-room; through the\\r\\nholy-of-holies of great forests; on Roman arches over Indian rivers; through\\r\\nsun and shade; by happy hearts or broken; through all the wide contrasting\\r\\nscenery of those noble Mohawk counties; and especially, by rows of snow-white\\r\\nchapels, whose spires stand almost like milestones, flows one continual stream\\r\\nof Venetianly corrupt and often lawless life. There\\'s your true Ashantee,\\r\\ngentlemen; there howl your pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you;\\r\\nunder the long-flung shadow, and the snug patronizing lee of churches. For by\\r\\nsome curious fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters\\r\\nthat they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so sinners, gentlemen, most\\r\\nabound in holiest vicinities.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Is that a friar passing?\\' said Don Pedro, looking downwards into the crowded\\r\\nplazza, with humorous concern.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella\\'s Inquisition wanes in Lima,\\'\\r\\nlaughed Don Sebastian. \\'Proceed, Senor.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'A moment! Pardon!\\' cried another of the company. \\'In the name of all us\\r\\nLimeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we have by no means\\r\\noverlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for distant Venice in\\r\\nyour corrupt comparison. Oh! do not bow and look surprised: you know the\\r\\nproverb all along this coast\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Corrupt as Lima.\" It but bears out your saying,\\r\\ntoo; churches more plentiful than billiard-tables, and for ever open-and\\r\\n\"Corrupt as Lima.\" So, too, Venice; I have been there; the holy city of the\\r\\nblessed evangelist, St. Mark!\\xe2\\x80\\x94St. Dominic, purge it! Your cup! Thanks: here I\\r\\nrefill; now, you pour out again.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would make a fine\\r\\ndramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he. Like Mark Antony,\\r\\nfor days and days along his green-turfed, flowery Nile, he indolently floats,\\r\\nopenly toying with his red-cheeked Cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon\\r\\nthe sunny deck. But ashore, all this effeminacy is dashed. The brigandish guise\\r\\nwhich the Canaller so proudly sports; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat\\r\\nbetoken his grand features. A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages\\r\\nthrough which he floats; his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in\\r\\ncities. Once a vagabond on his own canal, I have received good turns from one\\r\\nof these Canallers; I thank him heartily; would fain be not ungrateful; but it\\r\\nis often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence, that at\\r\\ntimes he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder\\r\\na wealthy one. In sum, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is\\r\\nemphatically evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so many of\\r\\nits most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of mankind, except Sydney\\r\\nmen, are so much distrusted by our whaling captains. Nor does it at all\\r\\ndiminish the curiousness of this matter, that to many thousands of our rural\\r\\nboys and young men born along its line, the probationary life of the Grand\\r\\nCanal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a Christian\\r\\ncorn-field, and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'I see! I see!\\' impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his<br>\\r\\nchicha upon his silvery ruffles. \\'No need to travel!<br>\\r\\nThe world\\'s one Lima. I had thought, now, that at your temperate<br>\\r\\nNorth the generations were cold and holy as the hills.\\xe2\\x80\\x94<br>\\r\\nBut the story.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I had left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay. Hardly had he\\r\\ndone so, when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four\\r\\nharpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck. But sliding down the ropes like\\r\\nbaleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the uproar, and sought to drag\\r\\ntheir man out of it towards the forecastle. Others of the sailors joined with\\r\\nthem in this attempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued; while standing out of\\r\\nharm\\'s way, the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale-pike, calling\\r\\nupon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him along to\\r\\nthe quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran close up to the revolving border of the\\r\\nconfusion, and prying into the heart of it with his pike, sought to prick out\\r\\nthe object of his resentment. But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much\\r\\nfor them all; they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily\\r\\nslewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass, these\\r\\nsea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Come out of that, ye pirates!\\' roared the captain, now menacing them with a\\r\\npistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. \\'Come out of that, ye\\r\\ncut-throats!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there, defied the\\r\\nworst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to understand distinctly, that\\r\\nhis (Steelkilt\\'s) death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part\\r\\nof all hands. Fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true, the\\r\\ncaptain a little desisted, but still commanded the insurgents instantly to\\r\\nreturn to their duty.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?\\' demanded their ringleader.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Turn to! turn to!\\xe2\\x80\\x94I make no promise; to your duty!<br>\\r\\nDo you want to sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this?<br>\\r\\nTurn to!\\' and he once more raised a pistol.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Sink the ship?\\' cried Steelkilt. \\'Aye, let her sink.<br>\\r\\nNot a man of us turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn<br>\\r\\nagainst us. What say ye, men?\\' turning to his comrades.<br>\\r\\nA fierce cheer was their response.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye on the\\r\\nCaptain, and jerking out such sentences as these:\\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\'It\\'s not our fault; we\\r\\ndidn\\'t want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was boy\\'s business; he\\r\\nmight have known me before this; I told him not to prick the buffalo; I believe\\r\\nI have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw; ain\\'t those mincing knives\\r\\ndown in the forecastle there, men? look to those handspikes, my hearties.\\r\\nCaptain, by God, look to yourself; say the word; don\\'t be a fool; forget it\\r\\nall; we are ready to turn to; treat us decently, and we\\'re your men; but we\\r\\nwon\\'t be flogged.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Look ye, now,\\' cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him, \\'there\\r\\nare a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped for the cruise,\\r\\nd\\'ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our discharge as soon as the\\r\\nanchor is down; so we don\\'t want a row; it\\'s not our interest; we want to be\\r\\npeaceable; we are ready to work, but we won\\'t be flogged.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Turn to!\\' roared the Captain.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\'I tell you what it is\\r\\nnow, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a shabby rascal, we\\r\\nwon\\'t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but till you say the word\\r\\nabout not flogging us, we don\\'t do a hand\\'s turn.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I\\'ll keep ye there till ye\\'re\\r\\nsick of it. Down ye go.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Shall we?\\' cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were against it; but\\r\\nat length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded him down into their dark\\r\\nden, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"As the Lakeman\\'s bare head was just level with the planks, the Captain and his\\r\\nposse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle,\\r\\nplanted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called for the steward to\\r\\nbring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered something down the\\r\\ncrack, closed it, and turned the key upon them\\xe2\\x80\\x94ten in number\\xe2\\x80\\x94 leaving on deck\\r\\nsome twenty or more, who thus far had remained neutral.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and aft,\\r\\nespecially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at which last place\\r\\nit was feared the insurgents might emerge, after breaking through the bulkhead\\r\\nbelow. But the hours of darkness passed in peace; the men who still remained at\\r\\ntheir duty toiling hard at the pumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals\\r\\nthrough the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck, summoned the\\r\\nprisoners to work; but with a yell they refused. Water was then lowered down to\\r\\nthem, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it; when again\\r\\nturning the key upon them and pocketing it, the Captain returned to the\\r\\nquarter-deck. Twice every day for three days this was repeated; but on the\\r\\nfourth morning a confused wrangling, and then a scuffling was heard, as the\\r\\ncustomary summons was delivered; and suddenly four men burst up from the\\r\\nforecastle, saying they were ready to turn to. The fetid closeness of the air,\\r\\nand a famishing diet, united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had\\r\\nconstrained them to surrender at discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain\\r\\nreiterated his demand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific\\r\\nhint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged. On the fifth\\r\\nmorning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate\\r\\narms below that sought to restrain them. Only three were left.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Better turn to, now?\\' said the Captain with a heartless jeer.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Shut us up again, will ye!\\' cried Steelkilt.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Oh! certainly,\" said the Captain, and the key clicked.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of seven of his\\r\\nformer associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him, and\\r\\nmaddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair;\\r\\nit was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two Canallers, thus far apparently\\r\\nof one mind with him, to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the\\r\\ngarrison; and armed with their keen mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy\\r\\nimplements with a handle at each end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the\\r\\ntaffrail; and if by any devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship.\\r\\nFor himself, he would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not. That\\r\\nwas the last night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met with no\\r\\nopposition on the part of the other two; they swore they were ready for that,\\r\\nor for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender. And what was\\r\\nmore, they each insisted upon being the first man on deck, when the time to\\r\\nmake the rush should come. But to this their leader as fiercely objected,\\r\\nreserving that priority for himself; particularly as his two comrades would not\\r\\nyield, the one to the other, in the matter; and both of them could not be\\r\\nfirst, for the ladder would but admit one man at a time. And here, gentlemen,\\r\\nthe foul play of these miscreants must come out.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own separate\\r\\nsoul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece of treachery,\\r\\nnamely: to be the foremost in breaking out, in order to be the first of the\\r\\nthree, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and thereby secure whatever\\r\\nsmall chance of pardon such conduct might merit. But when Steelkilt made known\\r\\nhis determination still to lead them to the last, they in some way, by some\\r\\nsubtle chemistry of villany, mixed their before secret treacheries together;\\r\\nand when their leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each\\r\\nother in three sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with\\r\\ncords; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he and all\\r\\nhis armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a few minutes the\\r\\nscuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still struggling ringleader\\r\\nwas shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies, who at once claimed the\\r\\nhonor of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder. But all these were\\r\\ncollared, and dragged along the deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were\\r\\nseized up into the mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they\\r\\nhung till morning. \\'Damn ye,\\' cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them,\\r\\n\\'the vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had rebelled from\\r\\nthose who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the former that he had a\\r\\ngood mind to flog them all round\\xe2\\x80\\x94thought, upon the while, he would do so\\xe2\\x80\\x94he\\r\\nought to\\xe2\\x80\\x94justice demanded it; but for the present, considering their timely\\r\\nsurrender, he would let them go with a reprimand, which he accordingly\\r\\nadministered in the vernacular.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'But as for you, ye carrion rogues,\\' turning to the three men in the\\r\\nrigging\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\'for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;\\' and, seizing a rope,\\r\\nhe applied it with all his might to the backs of the two traitors, till they\\r\\nyelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads sideways, as the two crucified\\r\\nthieves are drawn.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'My wrist is sprained with ye!\\' he cried, at last; \\'but there is still rope\\r\\nenough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn\\'t give up. Take that gag from\\r\\nhis mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped\\r\\njaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a sort of hiss, \\'What\\r\\nI say is this\\xe2\\x80\\x94and mind it well\\xe2\\x80\\x94- if you flog me, I murder you!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me\\'\\xe2\\x80\\x94and the Captain drew off with the\\r\\nrope to strike.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Best not,\\' hissed the Lakeman.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'But I must,\\'\\xe2\\x80\\x94and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the Captain; who, to\\r\\nthe amazement of all hands, started back, paced the deck rapidly two or three\\r\\ntimes, and then suddenly throwing down his rope, said, \\'I won\\'t do it\\xe2\\x80\\x94let him\\r\\ngo\\xe2\\x80\\x94 cut him down: d\\'ye hear?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale man, with a\\r\\nbandaged head, arrested them\\xe2\\x80\\x94Radney the chief mate. Ever since the blow, he had\\r\\nlain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the tumult on the deck, he had\\r\\ncrept out, and thus far had watched the whole scene. Such was the state of his\\r\\nmouth, that he could hardly speak; but mumbling something about his being\\r\\nwilling and able to do what the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope\\r\\nand advanced to his pinioned foe.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'You are a coward!\\' hissed the Lakeman.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'So I am, but take that.\\' The mate was in the very act of striking, when\\r\\nanother hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing no more, made\\r\\ngood his word, spite of Steelkilt\\'s threat, whatever that might have been. The\\r\\nthree men were then cut down, all hands were turned to, and, sullenly worked by\\r\\nthe moody seamen, the iron pumps clanged as before.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor was heard\\r\\nin the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up, besieged the\\r\\ncabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew. Entreaties, cuffs, and\\r\\nkicks could not drive them back, so at their own instance they were put down in\\r\\nthe ship\\'s run for salvation. Still, no sign of mutiny reappeared among the\\r\\nrest. On the contrary, it seemed, that mainly at Steelkilt\\'s instigation, they\\r\\nhad resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the\\r\\nlast, and, when the ship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to\\r\\ninsure the speediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another\\r\\nthing\\xe2\\x80\\x94namely, not to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered.\\r\\nFor, spite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still\\r\\nmaintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower for a\\r\\nfish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground; and\\r\\nRadney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat, and with his\\r\\nbandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of\\r\\npassiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till all was\\r\\nover) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung\\r\\nhim in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney the chief mate\\'s watch;\\r\\nand as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom,\\r\\nafter the scene at the rigging, he insisted, against the express counsel of the\\r\\ncaptain, upon resuming the head of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or\\r\\ntwo other circumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his\\r\\nrevenge.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"During the night, Radney had an unseaman-like way of sitting on the bulwarks\\r\\nof the quarterdeck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was\\r\\nhoisted up there, a little above the ship\\'s side. In this attitude, it was well\\r\\nknown, he sometimes dozed. There was a considerable vacancy between the boat\\r\\nand the ship, and down between this was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time,\\r\\nand found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o\\'clock, in\\r\\nthe morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his\\r\\nleisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his\\r\\nwatches below.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'What are you making there?\\' said a shipmate.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'What do you think? what does it look like?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Like a lanyard for your bag; but it\\'s an odd one, seems to me.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Yes, rather oddish,\\' said the Lakeman, holding it at arm\\'s length before him;\\r\\n\\'but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I haven\\'t enough twine,\\xe2\\x80\\x94have you any?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"But there was none in the forecastle.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Then I must get some from old Rad;\\' and he rose to go aft.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'You don\\'t mean to go a begging to him!\\' said a sailor.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Why not? Do you think he won\\'t do me a turn, when it\\'s to help himself in the\\r\\nend, shipmate?\\' and going to the mate, he looked at him quietly, and asked him\\r\\nfor some twine to mend his hammock. It was given him\\xe2\\x80\\x94neither twine nor lanyard\\r\\nwere seen again; but the next night an iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled\\r\\nfrom the pocket of the Lakeman\\'s monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into\\r\\nhis hammock for a pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent\\r\\nhelm\\xe2\\x80\\x94 nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to\\r\\nthe seaman\\'s hand\\xe2\\x80\\x94that fatal hour was then to come; and in the fore-ordaining\\r\\nsoul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse, with\\r\\nhis forehead crushed in.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody deed he had\\r\\nplanned. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the avenger. For by a\\r\\nmysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands\\r\\ninto its own the damning thing he would have done.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day,\\r\\nwhen they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe man, drawing\\r\\nwater in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, \\'There she rolls! there she\\r\\nrolls!\\' Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Moby Dick!\\' cried Don Sebastian; \\'St. Dominic! Sir sailor, but do whales have\\r\\nchristenings? Whom call you Moby Dick?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster, Don;\\xe2\\x80\\x94 but that\\r\\nwould be too long a story.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'How? how?\\' cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Nay, Dons, Dons\\xe2\\x80\\x94nay, nay! I cannot rehearse that now.<br>\\r\\nLet me get more into the air, Sirs.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'The chicha! the chicha!\\' cried Don Pedro; \\'our vigorous friend looks\\r\\nfaint;\\xe2\\x80\\x94fill up his empty glass!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Now, gentlemen, so suddenly\\r\\nperceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship\\xe2\\x80\\x94 forgetful of the\\r\\ncompact among the crew\\xe2\\x80\\x94in the excitement of the moment, the Teneriffe man had\\r\\ninstinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster, though for\\r\\nsome little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen\\r\\nmast-heads. All was now a phrensy. \\'The White Whale\\xe2\\x80\\x94the White Whale!\\' was the\\r\\ncry from captain, mates, and harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours,\\r\\nwere all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish; while the dogged\\r\\ncrew eyed askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky\\r\\nmass, that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a\\r\\nliving opal in the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the\\r\\nwhole career of these events, as if verily mapped out before the world itself\\r\\nwas charted. The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate, and when fast to a fish,\\r\\nit was his duty to sit next him, while Radney stood up with his lance in the\\r\\nprow, and haul in or slacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover, when\\r\\nthe four boats were lowered, the mate\\'s got the start; and none howled more\\r\\nfiercely with delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a\\r\\nstiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to the\\r\\nbow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat. And now his bandaged cry\\r\\nwas, to beach him on the whale\\'s topmost back. Nothing loath, his bowsman\\r\\nhauled him up and up, through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses\\r\\ntogether; till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge, and\\r\\nkeeling over, spilled out the standing mate. That instant, as he fell on the\\r\\nwhale\\'s slippery back, the boat righted, and was dashed aside by the swell,\\r\\nwhile Radney was tossed over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He\\r\\nstruck out through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that\\r\\nveil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But the whale\\r\\nrushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his jaws; and\\r\\nrearing high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went down.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Meantime, at the first tap of the boat\\'s bottom, the Lakeman had slackened the\\r\\nline, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly looking on, he thought\\r\\nhis own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific, downward jerking of the boat, quickly\\r\\nbrought his knife to the line. He cut it; and the whale was free. But, at some\\r\\ndistance, Moby Dick rose again, with some tatters of Radney\\'s red woollen\\r\\nshirt, caught in the teeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase\\r\\nagain; but the whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port\\xe2\\x80\\x94a savage, solitary place\\xe2\\x80\\x94 where no\\r\\ncivilized creature resided. There, headed by the Lakeman, all but five or six\\r\\nof the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms; eventually, as it\\r\\nturned out, seizing a large double war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail\\r\\nfor some other harbor.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"The ship\\'s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called upon the\\r\\nIslanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to\\r\\nstop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was\\r\\nthis small band of whites necessitated, both by night and by day, and so\\r\\nextreme was the hard work they underwent, that upon the vessel being ready\\r\\nagain for sea, they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst\\r\\nnot put off with them in so heavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his\\r\\nofficers, he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out\\r\\nhis two cannon from the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and warning the\\r\\nIslanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with him, and\\r\\nsetting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight before the wind for\\r\\nTahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a reinforcement to his crew.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which seemed to\\r\\nhave touched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from it; but the savage\\r\\ncraft bore down on him; and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him to heave to,\\r\\nor he would run him under water. The captain presented a pistol. With one foot\\r\\non each prow of the yoked war-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn;\\r\\nassuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury\\r\\nhim in bubbles and foam.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'What do you want of me?\\' cried the captain.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?\\' demanded Steelkilt; \\'no\\r\\nlies.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'I am bound to Tahiti for more men.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Very good. Let me board you a moment\\xe2\\x80\\x94I come in peace.\\' With that he leaped\\r\\nfrom the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale, stood face to face\\r\\nwith the captain.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As soon as\\r\\nSteelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder island, and remain\\r\\nthere six days. If I do not, may lightning strike me!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'A pretty scholar,\\' laughed the Lakeman. \\'Adios, Senor!\\' and leaping into the\\r\\nsea, he swam back to his comrades.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the roots of the\\r\\ncocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due time arrived at Tahiti,\\r\\nhis own place of destination. There, luck befriended him; two ships were about\\r\\nto sail for France, and were providentially in want of precisely that number of\\r\\nmen which the sailor headed. They embarked, and so for ever got the start of\\r\\ntheir former captain, had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived, and the\\r\\ncaptain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized Tahitians, who had been\\r\\nsomewhat used to the sea. Chartering a small native schooner, he returned with\\r\\nthem to his vessel; and finding all right there, again resumed his cruisings.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of\\r\\nNantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up\\r\\nits dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Are you through?\\' said Don Sebastian, quietly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'I am, Don.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions, this your\\r\\nstory is in substance really true?

It may be worth while, therefore,\\r\\npreviously to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even\\r\\ndown to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman. It is\\r\\ntime to set the world right in this matter, by proving such pictures of the\\r\\nwhale all wrong.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be found\\r\\namong the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For ever since those\\r\\ninventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings of temples, the\\r\\npedestals of statues, and on shields, medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin\\r\\nwas drawn in scales of chain-armor like Saladin\\'s, and a helmeted head like St.\\r\\nGeorge\\'s; ever since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed,\\r\\nnot only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific\\r\\npresentations of him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the\\r\\nwhale\\'s, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of Elephants, in India. The\\r\\nBrahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial\\r\\npagoda, all the trades and pursuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were\\r\\nprefigured ages before any of them actually came into being. No wonder then,\\r\\nthat in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there\\r\\nshadowed forth. The Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate department\\r\\nof the wall, depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan,\\r\\nlearnedly known as the Matse Avatar. But though this sculpture is half man and\\r\\nhalf whale, so as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small section\\r\\nof him is all wrong. It looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than\\r\\nthe broad palms of the true whale\\'s majestic flukes.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian painter\\'s\\r\\nportrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian Hindoo.\\r\\nIt is Guido\\'s picture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the sea-monster or\\r\\nwhale. Where did Guido get the model of such a strange creature as that? Nor\\r\\ndoes Hogarth, in painting the same scene in his own \"Perseus Descending,\" make\\r\\nout one whit better. The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates\\r\\non the surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on\\r\\nits back, and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling,\\r\\nmight be taken for the Traitors\\' Gate leading from the Thames by water into the\\r\\nTower. Then, there are the Prodromus whales of the old Scotch Sibbald, and\\r\\nJonah\\'s whale, as depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old\\r\\nprimers. What shall be said of these? As for the book-binder\\'s whale winding\\r\\nlike a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor\\xe2\\x80\\x94 as stamped and gilded\\r\\non the backs and titlepages of many books both old and new\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is a very\\r\\npicturesque but purely fabulous creature, imitated, I take it, from the like\\r\\nfigures on antique vases. Though universally denominated a dolphin, I\\r\\nnevertheless call this book-binder\\'s fish an attempt at a whale; because it was\\r\\nso intended when the device was first introduced. It was introduced by an old\\r\\nItalian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the Revival of\\r\\nLearning; and in those days, and even down to a comparatively late period,\\r\\ndolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the Leviathan.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at\\r\\ntimes meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all manner of spouts,\\r\\njets d\\'eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and Baden-Baden, come bubbling up\\r\\nfrom his unexhausted brain. In the title-page of the original edition of the\\r\\n\"Advancement of Learning\" you will find some curious whales.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those pictures\\r\\nof leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations, by those who\\r\\nknow. In old Harris\\'s collection of voyages there are some plates of whales\\r\\nextracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671, entitled \"A Whaling Voyage\\r\\nto Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland,\\r\\nmaster.\" In one of those plates the whales, like great rafts of logs, are\\r\\nrepresented lying among ice-isles, with white bears running over their living\\r\\nbacks. In another plate, the prodigious blunder is made of representing the\\r\\nwhale with perpendicular flukes.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain Colnett, a Post\\r\\nCaptain in the English navy, entitled \"A Voyage round Cape Horn into the South\\r\\nSeas, for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale Fisheries.\" In this\\r\\nbook is an outline purporting to be a \"Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti\\r\\nwhale, drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and\\r\\nhoisted on deck.\" I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for\\r\\nthe benefit of his marines. To mention but one thing about it, let me say that\\r\\nit has an eye which applied, according to the accompanying scale, to a full\\r\\ngrown sperm whale, would make the eye of that whale a bow-window some five feet\\r\\nlong. Ah, my gallant captain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out of that\\r\\neye!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the benefit\\r\\nof the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of mistake. Look at\\r\\nthat popular work \"Goldsmith\\'s Animated Nature.\" In the abridged London edition\\r\\nof 1807, there are plates of an alleged \"whale\" and a \"narwhale.\" I do not wish\\r\\nto seem inelegant, but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow;\\r\\nand, as for the narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in\\r\\nthis nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any\\r\\nintelligent public of schoolboys.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacepede, a great naturalist,\\r\\npublished a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are several pictures of\\r\\nthe different species of the Leviathan. All these are not only incorrect, but\\r\\nthe picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland whale (that is to say the Right\\r\\nwhale), even Scoresby, a long experienced man as touching that species,\\r\\ndeclares not to have its counterpart in nature.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was reserved\\r\\nfor the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous Baron. In 1836, he\\r\\npublished a Natural History of Whales, in which he gives what he calls a\\r\\npicture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that picture to any Nantucketer, you\\r\\nhad best provide for your summary retreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick\\r\\nCuvier\\'s Sperm Whale is not a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he never\\r\\nhad the benefit of a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he\\r\\nderived that picture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific\\r\\npredecessor in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions;\\r\\nthat is, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the pencil\\r\\nthose Chinese are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs for the sign-painters\\' whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of\\r\\noil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally Richard III.\\r\\nwhales, with dromedary humps, and very savage; breakfasting on three or four\\r\\nsailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of mariners: their deformities\\r\\nfloundering in seas of blood and blue paint.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising\\r\\nafter all. Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the\\r\\nstranded fish; and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship,\\r\\nwith broken back, would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its\\r\\nundashed pride of hull and spars. Though elephants have stood for their\\r\\nfull-lengths, the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his\\r\\nportrait. The living whale, in his full majesty and significance, is only to be\\r\\nseen at sea in unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of\\r\\nsight, like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a\\r\\nthing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so\\r\\nas to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations. And, not to speak of the\\r\\nhighly presumable difference of contour between a young suckling whale and a\\r\\nfull-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of one of those young\\r\\nsucking whales hoisted to a ship\\'s deck, such is then the outlandish, eel-like,\\r\\nlimbered, varying shape of him, that his precise expression the devil himself\\r\\ncould not catch.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale,\\r\\naccurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at all. For it is one\\r\\nof the more curious things about this Leviathan, that his skeleton gives very\\r\\nlittle idea of his general shape. Though Jeremy Bentham\\'s skeleton, which hangs\\r\\nfor candelabra in the library of one of his executors, correctly conveys the\\r\\nidea of a burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy\\'s other\\r\\nleading personal characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred\\r\\nfrom any leviathan\\'s articulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the\\r\\nmere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and\\r\\npadded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes\\r\\nit. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this\\r\\nbook will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously displayed in the\\r\\nside fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human\\r\\nhand, minus only the thumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers, the index,\\r\\nmiddle, ring, and little finger. But all these are permanently lodged in their\\r\\nfleshy covering, as the human fingers in an artificial covering. \"However\\r\\nrecklessly the whale may sometimes serve us,\" said humorous Stubb one day, \"he\\r\\ncan never be truly said to handle us without mittens.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs\\r\\nconclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which must\\r\\nremain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit the mark much nearer\\r\\nthan another, but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of\\r\\nexactness. So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale\\r\\nreally looks like. And the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable\\r\\nidea of his living contour, is by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing,\\r\\nyou run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it\\r\\nseems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this\\r\\nLeviathan.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 56</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales and the True Pictures of Whaling\\r\\nScenes\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly tempted here\\r\\nto enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found\\r\\nin certain books, both ancient and modern, especially in Pliny, Purchas,\\r\\nHackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, &amp;c. But I pass that matter by.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale; Colnett\\'s,\\r\\nHuggins\\'s, Frederick Cuvier\\'s, and Beale\\'s. In the previous chapter Colnett and\\r\\nCuvier have been referred to. Huggins\\'s is far better than theirs; but, by\\r\\ngreat odds, Beale\\'s is the best. All Beale\\'s drawings of this whale are good,\\r\\nexcepting the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various\\r\\nattitudes, capping his second chapter. His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm\\r\\nWhales, though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some\\r\\nparlor men, is admirably correct and life-like in its general effect. Some of\\r\\nthe Sperm Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour; but\\r\\nthey are wretchedly engraved. That is not his fault though.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but they are\\r\\ndrawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has but one\\r\\npicture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency, because it is by such\\r\\npictures only, when at all well done, that you can derive anything like a\\r\\ntruthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details not the\\r\\nmost correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found,\\r\\nare two large French engravings, well executed, and taken from paintings by one\\r\\nGarnery. Respectively, they represent attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In\\r\\nthe first engraving a noble Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might,\\r\\njust risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing\\r\\nhigh in the. air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The\\r\\nprow of the boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the\\r\\nmonster\\'s spine; and standing in that prow, for that one single incomputable\\r\\nflash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling\\r\\nspout of the whale, and in the act of leaping, as if from a precipice. The\\r\\naction of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true. The half-emptied\\r\\nline-tub floats on the whitened sea; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons\\r\\nobliquely bob in it; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the\\r\\nwhale in contrasting expressions of affright; while in the black stormy\\r\\ndistance the ship is bearing down upon the scene. Serious fault might be found\\r\\nwith the anatomical details of this whale, but let that pass; since, for the\\r\\nlife of me, I could not draw so good a one.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the\\r\\nbarnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his black weedy bulk\\r\\nin the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the Patagonian cliffs. His jets are\\r\\nerect, full, and black like soot; so that from so abounding a smoke in the\\r\\nchimney, you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great\\r\\nbowels below. Sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other\\r\\nsea candies and maccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his\\r\\npestilent back. And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through\\r\\nthe deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and causing the\\r\\nslight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of\\r\\nan ocean steamer. Thus, the fore-ground is all raging commotion; but behind, in\\r\\nadmirable artistic contrast, is the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the\\r\\ndrooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead\\r\\nwhale, a conquered fortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the\\r\\nwhale-pole inserted into his spout-hole.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWho Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he was\\r\\neither practically conversant with his subject, or else marvellously tutored by\\r\\nsome experienced whaleman. The French are the lads for painting action. Go and\\r\\ngaze upon all the paintings in Europe, and where will you find such a gallery\\r\\nof living and breathing commotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at\\r\\nVersailles; where the beholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the\\r\\nconsecutive great battles of France; where every sword seems a flash of the\\r\\nNorthern Lights, and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by, like a\\r\\ncharge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery, are\\r\\nthese sea battle-pieces of Garnery.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of things\\r\\nseems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of\\r\\ntheir whaling scenes. With not one tenth of England\\'s experience in the\\r\\nfishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the Americans, they have\\r\\nnevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all\\r\\ncapable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt. For the most part, the\\r\\nEnglish and American whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting\\r\\nthe mechanical outline of things, such as the vacant profile of the whale;\\r\\nwhich, so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to\\r\\nsketching the profile of a pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly renowned Right\\r\\nwhaleman, after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale, and three\\r\\nor four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises, treats us to a series\\r\\nof classical engravings of boat hooks, chopping knives, and grapnels; and with\\r\\nthe microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a\\r\\nshivering world ninety-six fac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals. I\\r\\nmean no disparagement to the excellent voyager (I honor him for a veteran), but\\r\\nin so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for\\r\\nevery crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two other French\\r\\nengravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself \"H. Durand.\" One\\r\\nof them, though not precisely adapted to our present purpose, nevertheless\\r\\ndeserves mention on other accounts. It is a quiet noon-scene among the isles of\\r\\nthe Pacific; a French whaler anchored, inshore, in a calm, and lazily taking\\r\\nwater on board; the loosened sails of the ship, and the long leaves of the\\r\\npalms in the background, both drooping together in the breezeless air. The\\r\\neffect is very fine, when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy\\r\\nfishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose. The other\\r\\nengraving is quite a different affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and\\r\\nin the very heart of the Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside; the\\r\\nvessel (in the act of cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to a quay; and\\r\\na boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is about giving\\r\\nchase to whales in the distance. The harpoons and lances lie levelled for use;\\r\\nthree oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole; while from a sudden roll\\r\\nof the sea, the little craft stands half-erect out of the water, like a rearing\\r\\nhorse. From the ship, the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going\\r\\nup like the smoke over a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud,\\r\\nrising up with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the activity of\\r\\nthe excited seamen.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 57</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf Whales in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in Stone; in Mountains;\\r\\nin Stars\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOn Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen a crippled\\r\\nbeggar (or kedger, as the sailors say) holding a painted board before him,\\r\\nrepresenting the tragic scene in which he lost his leg. There are three whales\\r\\nand three boats; and one of the boats (presumed to contain the missing leg in\\r\\nall its original integrity) is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost\\r\\nwhale. Any time these ten years, they tell me, has that man held up that\\r\\npicture, and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world. But the time of his\\r\\njustification has now come. His three whales are as good whales as were ever\\r\\npublished in Wapping, at any rate; and his stump as unquestionable a stump as\\r\\nany you will find in the western clearings.

Some of them have little\\r\\nboxes of dentistical-looking implements, specially intended for the\\r\\nskrimshandering business. But, in general, they toil with their jack-knives\\r\\nalone; and, with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor, they will turn you\\r\\nout anything you please, in the way of a mariner\\'s fancy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLong exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that\\r\\ncondition in which God placed him, i.e. what is called savagery.

I myself am a savage, owning\\r\\nno allegiance but to the King of the Cannibals; and ready at any moment to\\r\\nrebel against him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours,\\r\\nis his wonderful patience of industry. An ancient Hawaiian war-club or\\r\\nspear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving, is as great\\r\\na trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon. For, with but a bit of\\r\\nbroken sea-shell or a shark\\'s tooth, that miraculous intricacy of wooden\\r\\nnet-work has been achieved; and it has cost steady years of steady application.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage. With the same\\r\\nmarvellous patience, and with the same single shark\\'s tooth, of his one poor\\r\\njack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not quite as\\r\\nworkmanlike, but as close packed in its maziness of design, as the Greek\\r\\nsavage, Achilles\\'s shield; and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness, as\\r\\nthe prints of that fine old Dutch savage, Albert Durer.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the\\r\\nnoble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met with in the forecastles of\\r\\nAmerican whalers. Some of them are done with much accuracy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the\\r\\ntail for knockers to the road-side door. When the porter is sleepy, the\\r\\nanvil-headed whale would be best. But these knocking whales are seldom\\r\\nremarkable as faithful essays. On the spires of some old-fashioned churches you\\r\\nwill see sheet-iron whales placed there for weathercocks; but they are so\\r\\nelevated, and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with\\r\\n\"Hands off!\" you cannot examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken cliffs\\r\\nmasses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain, you will often\\r\\ndiscover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan partly merged in\\r\\ngrass, which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually\\r\\ngirdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there from some lucky point of\\r\\nview you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined along\\r\\nthe undulating ridges. But you must be a thorough whaleman, to see these\\r\\nsights; and not only that, but if you wish to return to such a sight again, you\\r\\nmust be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your\\r\\nfirst stand-point, else so chance-like are such observations of the hills, that\\r\\nyour precise, previous stand-point would require a laborious re-discovery; like\\r\\nthe Solomon islands, which still remain incognita, though once high-ruffed\\r\\nMendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicled them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace out great\\r\\nwhales in the starry heavens, and boats in pursuit of them; as when long filled\\r\\nwith thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the\\r\\nclouds. Thus at the North have I chased Leviathan round and round the Pole with\\r\\nthe revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me. And beneath\\r\\nthe effulgent Antarctic skies I have boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined the\\r\\nchase against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and the\\r\\nFlying Fish.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWith a frigate\\'s anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for spurs,\\r\\nwould I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies, to see whether the\\r\\nfabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped beyond my\\r\\nmortal sight!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 58</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBrit\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSteering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast meadows of\\r\\nbrit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right Whale largely feeds.\\r\\nFor leagues and leagues it undulated round us, so that we seemed to be sailing\\r\\nthrough boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOn the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from the\\r\\nattack of a Sperm-Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly swam\\r\\nthrough the brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous\\r\\nVenetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner separated from the water\\r\\nthat escaped at the lips.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their scythes\\r\\nthrough the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so these monsters swam, making\\r\\na strange, grassy, cutting sound; and leaving behind them endless swaths of\\r\\nblue upon the yellow sea.*\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n*That part of the sea known among whalemen as the \"Brazil Banks\" does not bear\\r\\nthat name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there being shallows and\\r\\nsoundings there, but because of this remarkable meadow-like appearance, caused\\r\\nby the vast drifts of brit continually floating in those latitudes, where the\\r\\nRight Whale is often chased.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all\\r\\nreminded one of mowers. Seen from the mast-heads, especially when they paused\\r\\nand were stationary for a while, their vast black forms looked more like\\r\\nlifeless masses of rock than anything else. And as in the great hunting\\r\\ncountries of India, the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the\\r\\nplains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such, taking them for\\r\\nbare, blackened elevations of the soil; even so, often, with him, who for the\\r\\nfirst time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea. And even when\\r\\nrecognized at last, their immense magnitude renders it very hard really to\\r\\nbelieve that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct, in all\\r\\nparts, with the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIndeed. in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep with\\r\\nthe same feelings that you do those of the shore. For though some old\\r\\nnaturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in\\r\\nthe sea; and though taking a broad general view of the thing, this may very\\r\\nwell be; yet coming to specialties, where, for example, does the ocean furnish\\r\\nany fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog? The\\r\\naccursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative\\r\\nanalogy to him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the seas have\\r\\never been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling; though we\\r\\nknow the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita, so that Columbus sailed over\\r\\nnumberless unknown worlds to discover his one superficial western one; though,\\r\\nby vast odds, the most terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially and\\r\\nindiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone\\r\\nupon the waters; though but a moment\\'s consideration will teach that, however\\r\\nbaby man may brag of his science and skill, and however much, in a flattering\\r\\nfuture, that science and skill may augment; yet for ever and for ever, to the\\r\\ncrack of doom, the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize the\\r\\nstateliest, stiffest frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the continual\\r\\nrepetition of these very impressions, man has lost that sense of the full\\r\\nawfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese vengeance\\r\\nhad whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow. That same ocean\\r\\nrolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last year. Yea,\\r\\nfoolish mortals, Noah\\'s flood is not yet subsided; two thirds of the fair world\\r\\nit yet covers.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a miracle\\r\\nupon the other? Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews, when under the\\r\\nfeet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for\\r\\never; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in precisely the same manner the live\\r\\nsea swallows up ships and crews.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it is also\\r\\na fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who murdered his own\\r\\nguests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned. Like a savage\\r\\ntigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs, so the sea dashes\\r\\neven the mightiest whales against the rocks, and leaves them there side by side\\r\\nwith the split wrecks of ships. No mercy, no power but its own controls it.\\r\\nPanting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider, the\\r\\nmasterless ocean overruns the globe.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nConsider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide under\\r\\nwater, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously hidden beneath the\\r\\nloveliest tints of azure.

For as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant\\r\\nland, so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti, full of peace and\\r\\njoy, but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life.

And still, at wide\\r\\nintervals in the silvery night, the lonely, alluring jet would be seen.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost preternatural spread\\r\\nover the sea, however unattended with any stagnant calm; when the long\\r\\nburnished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across them,\\r\\nenjoining some secrecy; when the slippered waves whispered together as they\\r\\nsoftly ran on; in this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre\\r\\nwas seen by Daggoo from the main-mast-head.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher and higher,\\r\\nand disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed before our prow like a\\r\\nsnow-slide, new slid from the hills. Thus glistening for a moment, as slowly it\\r\\nsubsided, and sank. Then once more arose, and silently gleamed. It seemed not a\\r\\nwhale; and yet is this Moby Dick? thought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down,\\r\\nbut on re-appearing once more, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man\\r\\nfrom his nod, the negro yelled out\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"There! there again! there she breaches!\\r\\nright ahead! The White Whale, the White Whale!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nUpon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time the bees\\r\\nrush to the boughs. Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab stood on the bowsprit,\\r\\nand with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to the\\r\\nhelmsman, cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the\\r\\noutstretched motionless arm of Daggoo.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had gradually\\r\\nworked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect the ideas of mildness\\r\\nand repose with the first sight of the particular whale he pursued; however\\r\\nthis was, or whether his eagerness betrayed him; whichever way it might have\\r\\nbeen, no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass, than with a quick\\r\\nintensity he instantly gave orders for lowering.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe four boats were soon on the water; Ahab\\'s in advance, and all swiftly\\r\\npulling towards their prey. Soon it went down, and while, with oars suspended,\\r\\nwe were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the same spot where it sank, once\\r\\nmore it slowly rose. Almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of Moby\\r\\nDick, we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have\\r\\nhitherto revealed to mankind. A vast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and\\r\\nbreadth, of a glancing cream-color, lay floating on the water, innumerable long\\r\\narms radiating from its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest of\\r\\nanacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach. No\\r\\nperceptible face or front did it have; no conceivable token of either sensation\\r\\nor instinct; but undulated there on the billows, an unearthly, formless,\\r\\nchance-like apparition of life.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck still gazing\\r\\nat the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild voice exclaimed\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Almost\\r\\nrather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him, than to have seen thee, thou white\\r\\nghost!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What was it, Sir?\" said Flask.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld, and\\r\\nreturned to their ports to tell of it.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel; the rest\\r\\nas silently following.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the\\r\\nsight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it being so very\\r\\nunusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness. So\\r\\nrarely is it beheld, that though one and all of them declare it to be the\\r\\nlargest animated thing in the ocean, yet very few of them have any but the most\\r\\nvague ideas concerning its true nature and form; notwithstanding, they believe\\r\\nit to furnish to the sperm whale his only food. For though other species of\\r\\nwhales find their food above water, and may be seen by man in the act of\\r\\nfeeding, the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the\\r\\nsurface; and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what, precisely,\\r\\nthat food consists. At times, when closely pursued, he will disgorge what are\\r\\nsupposed to be the detached arms of the squid; some of them thus exhibited\\r\\nexceeding twenty and thirty feet in length. They fancy that the monster to\\r\\nwhich these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean;\\r\\nand that the sperm whale, unlike other species, is supplied with teeth in order\\r\\nto attack and tear it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop Pontoppodan\\r\\nmay ultimately resolve itself into Squid. The manner in which the Bishop\\r\\ndescribes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with some other particulars he\\r\\nnarrates, in all this the two correspond. But much abatement is necessary with\\r\\nrespect to the incredible bulk he assigns it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious creature,\\r\\nhere spoken of, it is included among the class of cuttle-fish, to which,\\r\\nindeed, in certain external respects it would seem to belong, but only as the\\r\\nAnak of the tribe.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 60</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Line\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWith reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as for the\\r\\nbetter understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented, I have here to\\r\\nspeak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly vapored\\r\\nwith tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary ropes; for while\\r\\ntar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable to the rope-maker, and\\r\\nalso renders the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use;\\r\\nyet, not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for\\r\\nthe close coiling to which it must be subjected; but as most seamen are\\r\\nbeginning to learn, tar in general by no means adds to the rope\\'s durability or\\r\\nstrength, however much it may give it compactness and gloss.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely\\r\\nsuperseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not so durable as\\r\\nhemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and I will add (since\\r\\nthere is an aesthetics in all things), is much more handsome and becoming to\\r\\nthe boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark fellow, a sort of Indian; but\\r\\nManilla is as a golden-haired Circassian to behold.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe whale-line is only two thirds of an inch in thickness. At first sight, you\\r\\nwould not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment its one and fifty\\r\\nyarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds; so that the\\r\\nwhole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons. In length, the common\\r\\nsperm whale-line measures something over two hundred fathoms. Towards the stern\\r\\nof the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a\\r\\nstill though, but so as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded\\r\\n\"sheaves,\" or layers of concentric spiralizations, without any hollow but the\\r\\n\"heart,\" or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese. As the least\\r\\ntangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take somebody\\'s\\r\\narm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line\\r\\nin its tub. Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this\\r\\nbusiness, carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a\\r\\nblock towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible\\r\\nwrinkles and twists.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line being\\r\\ncontinuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in this; because\\r\\nthese twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat, and do not\\r\\nstrain it so much; whereas, the American tub, nearly three feet in diameter and\\r\\nof proportionate depth, makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks\\r\\nare but one-half inch in thickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like\\r\\ncritical ice, which will bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not\\r\\nvery much of a concentrated one. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on\\r\\nthe american line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a\\r\\nprodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBoth ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an eye-splice\\r\\nor loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub, and hanging over\\r\\nits edge completely disengaged from everything. This arrangement of the lower\\r\\nend is necessary on two accounts. First: In order to facilitate the fastening\\r\\nto it of an additional line from a neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale\\r\\nshould sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally\\r\\nattached to the harpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted\\r\\nlike a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the first\\r\\nboat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. Second: This arrangement is\\r\\nindispensable for common safety\\'s sake; for were the lower end of the line in\\r\\nany way attached to the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to\\r\\nthe end almost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would not\\r\\nstop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into\\r\\nthe profundity of the sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBefore lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is taken aft\\r\\nfrom the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is again carried forward\\r\\nthe entire length of the boat, resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of\\r\\nevery man\\'s oar, so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing; and also passing\\r\\nbetween the men, as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales, to the\\r\\nleaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a\\r\\nwooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill, prevents it from slipping out.\\r\\nFrom the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed\\r\\ninside the boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being\\r\\ncoiled upon the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale still a\\r\\nlittle further aft, and is then attached to the short-warp\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the rope which is\\r\\nimmediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to that connexion, the\\r\\nshort-warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils, twisting and\\r\\nwrithing around it in almost every direction. All the oarsmen are involved in\\r\\nits perilous contortions; so that to the timid eye of the landsman, they seem\\r\\nas Indian jugglers, with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their\\r\\nlimbs. Nor can any son of mortal woman, for the first time, seat himself amid\\r\\nthose hempen intricacies, and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink\\r\\nhim that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these\\r\\nhorrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus\\r\\ncircumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to\\r\\nquiver in him like a shaken jelly. Yet habit\\xe2\\x80\\x94strange thing! what cannot habit\\r\\naccomplish?\\xe2\\x80\\x94Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes, and brighter\\r\\nrepartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than you will hear over the\\r\\nhalf-inch white cedar of the whaleboat, when thus hung in hangman\\'s nooses;\\r\\nand, like the six burghers of Calais before King Edward, the six men composing\\r\\nthe crew pull into the jaws of death, with a halter around every neck, as you\\r\\nmay say.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPerhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated\\r\\nwhaling disasters\\xe2\\x80\\x94some few of which are casually chronicled\\xe2\\x80\\x94of this man or that\\r\\nman being taken out of the boat by the line, and lost. For, when the line is\\r\\ndarting out, to be seated then in the boat, is like being seated in the midst\\r\\nof the manifold whizzings of a steam-engine in full play, when every flying\\r\\nbeam, and shaft, and wheel, is grazing you. It is worse; for you cannot sit\\r\\nmotionless in the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a\\r\\ncradle, and you are pitched one way and the other, without the slightest\\r\\nwarning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of\\r\\nvolition and action, can you escape being made a Mazeppa of, and run away with\\r\\nwhere the all-seeing sun himself could never pierce you out.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAgain: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of\\r\\nthe storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself; for, indeed, the calm\\r\\nis but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and contains it in itself, as the\\r\\nseemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder, and the ball, and the\\r\\nexplosion; so the graceful repose of the line, as it silently serpentines about\\r\\nthe oarsmen before being brought into actual play\\xe2\\x80\\x94 this is a thing which\\r\\ncarries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair. But\\r\\nwhy say more? All men live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters\\r\\nround their necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of\\r\\ndeath, that mortals realize the silent, subtle, everpresent perils of life. And\\r\\nif you be a philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would not at\\r\\nheart feel one whit more of terror, than though seated before your evening fire\\r\\nwith a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 61</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nStubb Kills a Whale\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIf to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents, to Queequeg\\r\\nit was quite a different object.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"When you see him \\'quid,\" said the savage, honing his harpoon in the bow of his\\r\\nhoisted boat, \"then you quick see him \\'parm whale.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special to\\r\\nengage them, the Pequod\\'s crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced\\r\\nby such a vacant sea.

So that at last all three of us\\r\\nlifelessly swung from the spars, and for every swing that we made there was a\\r\\nnod from below from the slumbering helmsman.

As if struck by some enchanter\\'s wand, the sleepy ship and every\\r\\nsleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness; and more than a score of\\r\\nvoices from all parts of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from\\r\\naloft, shouted forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly\\r\\nspouted the sparkling brine into the air.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Clear away the boats!

And obeying his own order, he dashed\\r\\nthe helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and ere the\\r\\nboats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the leeward, but with\\r\\nsuch a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples as he swam, that thinking\\r\\nafter all he might not as yet be alarmed, Ahab gave orders that not an oar\\r\\nshould be used, and no man must speak but in whispers. So seated like Ontario\\r\\nIndians on the gunwales of the boats, we swiftly but silently paddled along;\\r\\nthe calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus\\r\\nglided in chase, the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into\\r\\nthe air, and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"There go flukes!\" was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by Stubb\\'s\\r\\nproducing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite was granted. After\\r\\nthe full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the whale rose again, and being\\r\\nnow in advance of the smoker\\'s boat, and much nearer to it than to any of the\\r\\nothers, Stubb counted upon the honor of the capture. It was obvious, now, that\\r\\nthe whale had at length become aware of his pursuers. All silence of\\r\\ncautiousness was therefore no longer of use. Paddles were dropped, and oars\\r\\ncame loudly into play. And still puffing at his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew\\r\\nto the assault.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nYes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his jeopardy, he was\\r\\ngoing \"head out\"; that part obliquely projecting from the mad yeast which he\\r\\nbrewed.*\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n*It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire\\r\\ninterior of the sperm whale\\'s enormous head consists. Though apparently the\\r\\nmost massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about him. So that with ease\\r\\nhe elevates it in the air, and invariably does so when going at his utmost\\r\\nspeed. Besides, such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head,\\r\\nand such the tapering cut-water formation of the lower part, that by obliquely\\r\\nelevating his head, he thereby may be said to transform himself from a\\r\\nbluff-bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed New York pilot-boat.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Start her, start her, my men! Don\\'t hurry yourselves; take plenty of time\\xe2\\x80\\x94but\\r\\nstart her; start her like thunder-claps, that\\'s all,\" cried Stubb, spluttering\\r\\nout the smoke as he spoke. \"Start her, now; give \\'em the long and strong\\r\\nstroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy\\xe2\\x80\\x94 start her, all; but keep cool, keep\\r\\ncool\\xe2\\x80\\x94cucumbers is the word\\xe2\\x80\\x94 easy, easy\\xe2\\x80\\x94only start her like grim death and\\r\\ngrinning devils, and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves,\\r\\nboys\\xe2\\x80\\x94 that\\'s all. Start her!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!\" screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some old war-whoop\\r\\nto the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced\\r\\nforward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager Indian gave.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild. \"Kee-hee! Kee-hee!\"\\r\\nyelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards on his seat, like a pacing\\r\\ntiger in his cage.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Ka-la! Koo-loo!\" howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a mouthful of\\r\\nGrenadier\\'s steak. And thus with oars and yells the keels cut the sea.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Stubb, retaining his place in the van, still encouraged his men to\\r\\nthe onset, all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth. Like desperadoes\\r\\nthey tugged and they strained, till the welcome cry was heard\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Stand up,\\r\\nTashtego!\\xe2\\x80\\x94give it to him!\" The harpoon was hurled. \"Stern all!\" The oarsmen\\r\\nbacked water; the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of\\r\\ntheir wrists. It was the magical line. An instant before, Stubb had swiftly\\r\\ncaught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence, by reason of\\r\\nits increased rapid circlings, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled\\r\\nwith the steady fumes from his pipe. As the line passed round and round the\\r\\nloggerhead; so also, just before reaching that point, it blisteringly passed\\r\\nthrough and through both of Stubb\\'s hands, from which the hand-cloths, or\\r\\nsquares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times, had accidentally\\r\\ndropped. It was like holding an enemy\\'s sharp two-edged sword by the blade, and\\r\\nthat enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Wet the line! wet the line!\" cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him seated by the\\r\\ntub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed the sea-water into it.* More turns were\\r\\ntaken, so that the line began holding its place. The boat now flew through the\\r\\nboiling water like a shark all fins. Stubb and Tashtego here changed\\r\\nplaces\\xe2\\x80\\x94stem for stern\\xe2\\x80\\x94a staggering business truly in that rocking commotion.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n*Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be stated, that,\\r\\nin the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the running line with water;\\r\\nin many other ships, a wooden piggin, or bailer, is set apart for that purpose.\\r\\nYour hat, however, is the most convenient.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFrom the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the\\r\\nboat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you would have\\r\\nthought the craft had two keels\\xe2\\x80\\x94one cleaving the water, the other the air\\xe2\\x80\\x94as\\r\\nthe boat churned on through both opposing elements at once. A continual cascade\\r\\nplayed at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake; and, at the\\r\\nslightest motion from within, even but of a little finger, the vibrating,\\r\\ncracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea. Thus they\\r\\nrushed; each man with might and main clinging to his seat, to prevent being\\r\\ntossed to the foam; and the tall form of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching\\r\\nalmost double, in order to bring down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics\\r\\nand Pacifics seemed passed as they shot on their way, till at length the whale\\r\\nsomewhat slackened his flight.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Haul in\\xe2\\x80\\x94haul in!\" cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round towards the\\r\\nwhale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while yet the boat was being\\r\\ntowed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb, firmly planting his knee in the\\r\\nclumsy cleat, darted dart after dart into the flying fish; at the word of\\r\\ncommand, the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whale\\'s horrible\\r\\nwallow, and then ranging up for another fling.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill.\\r\\nHis tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which bubbled and seethed\\r\\nfor furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun playing upon this crimson\\r\\npond in the sea, sent back its reflection into every face, so that they all\\r\\nglowed to each other like red men. And all the while, jet after jet of white\\r\\nsmoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff\\r\\nafter puff from the mouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in\\r\\nupon his crooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb straightened it\\r\\nagain and again, by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then again and again\\r\\nsent it into the whale.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Pull up\\xe2\\x80\\x94pull up!\" he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale relaxed in\\r\\nhis wrath. \"Pull up!\\xe2\\x80\\x94close to!\" and the boat ranged along the fish\\'s flank.\\r\\nWhen reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into\\r\\nthe fish, and kept it there, carefully churning and churning, as if cautiously\\r\\nseeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed, and\\r\\nwhich he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out. But that gold watch\\r\\nhe sought was the innermost life of the fish. And now it is struck; for,\\r\\nstarting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his \"flurry,\" the\\r\\nmonster horribly wallowed in his blood, overwrapped himself in impenetrable,\\r\\nmad, boiling spray, so that the imperilled craft, instantly dropping astern,\\r\\nhad much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the\\r\\nclear air of the day.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into view!\\r\\nsurging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and contracting his\\r\\nspout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations. At last, gush after\\r\\ngush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees of red wine, shot\\r\\ninto the frightened air; and falling back again, ran dripping down his\\r\\nmotionless flanks into the sea. His heart had burst!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"He\\'s dead, Mr. Stubb,\" said Daggoo.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Yes; both pipes smoked out!\" and withdrawing his own from his mouth, Stubb\\r\\nscattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood thoughtfully\\r\\neyeing the vast corpse he had made.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 62</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Dart\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA word concerning an incident in the last chapter.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAccording to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes off\\r\\nfrom the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary steersman, and\\r\\nthe harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost oar, the one known as the\\r\\nharpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong, nervous arm to strike the first iron\\r\\ninto the fish; for often, in what is called a long dart, the heavy implement\\r\\nhas to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged\\r\\nand exhausting the chase, the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile\\r\\nto the uttermost; indeed, he is expected to set an example of superhuman\\r\\nactivity to the rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and\\r\\nintrepid exclamations; and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one\\'s\\r\\ncompass, while all the other muscles are strained and half started\\xe2\\x80\\x94 what that\\r\\nis none know but those who have tried it. For one, I cannot bawl very heartily\\r\\nand work very recklessly at one and the same time. In this straining, bawling\\r\\nstate, then, with his back to the fish, all at once the exhausted harpooneer\\r\\nhears the exciting cry\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Stand up, and give it to him!\" He now has to drop and\\r\\nsecure his oar, turn round on his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the\\r\\ncrotch, and with what little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it somehow\\r\\ninto the whale. No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body, that\\r\\nout of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are successful; no wonder that\\r\\nso many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated; no wonder that some\\r\\nof them actually burst their blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some\\r\\nsperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many\\r\\nship owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer that\\r\\nmakes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect\\r\\nto find it there when most wanted!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAgain, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant, that is,\\r\\nwhen the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to\\r\\nrunning fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one\\r\\nelse. It is then they change places; and the headsman, the chief officer of the\\r\\nlittle craft, takes his proper station in the bows of the boat.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both foolish and\\r\\nunnecessary. The headsman should stay in the bows from first to last; he should\\r\\nboth dart the harpoon and the lance, and no rowing whatever should be expected\\r\\nof him, except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman. I know that this\\r\\nwould sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase; but long\\r\\nexperience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in\\r\\nthe vast majority of failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so\\r\\nmuch the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the\\r\\nharpooneer that has caused them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTo insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this world\\r\\nmust start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from out of toil.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 63</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Crotch\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOut of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs.<br>\\r\\nSo, in productive subjects, grow the chapters.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention. It is a\\r\\nnotched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length, which is\\r\\nperpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow, for the\\r\\npurpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoons, whose\\r\\nother naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the prow. Thereby the weapon is\\r\\ninstantly at hand to its hurler, who snatches it up as readily from its rest as\\r\\na backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall. It is customary to have two\\r\\nharpoons reposing in the crotch, respectively called the first and second\\r\\nirons.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with the line;\\r\\nthe object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one instantly after the\\r\\nother into the same whale; so that if, in the coming drag, one should draw out,\\r\\nthe other may still retain a hold. It is a doubling of the chances. But it very\\r\\noften happens that owing to the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of\\r\\nthe whale upon receiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the\\r\\nharpooneer, however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron\\r\\ninto him. Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the line,\\r\\nand the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events, be\\r\\nanticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else the most\\r\\nterrible jeopardy would involve all hands. Tumbled into the water, it\\r\\naccordingly is in such cases; the spare coils of box line (mentioned in a\\r\\npreceding chapter) making this feat, in most instances, prudently practicable.\\r\\nBut this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal\\r\\ncasualties.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFurthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard, it\\r\\nthenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror, skittishly curvetting about\\r\\nboth boat and whale, entangling the lines, or cutting them, and making a\\r\\nprodigious sensation in all directions. Nor, in general, is it possible to\\r\\nsecure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nConsider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one\\r\\nunusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these qualities in\\r\\nhim, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious\\r\\nenterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling\\r\\nabout him. For, of course, each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend\\r\\non to the line should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery.\\r\\nAll these particulars are faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to\\r\\nelucidate several most important however intricate passages, in scenes\\r\\nhereafter to be painted.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 64</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nStubb\\'s Supper\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nStubb\\'s whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was a calm; so,\\r\\nforming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow business of towing the\\r\\ntrophy to the Pequod. And now, as we eighteen men with our thirty-six arms, and\\r\\none hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon\\r\\nthat inert, sluggish corpse in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all,\\r\\nexcept at long intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the\\r\\nenormousness of the mass we moved. For, upon the great canal of Hang-Ho, or\\r\\nwhatever they call it, in China, four or five laborers on the foot-path will\\r\\ndraw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour; but this grand\\r\\nargosy we towed heavily forged along, as if laden with piglead in bulk.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDarkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod\\'s main-rigging\\r\\ndimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab dropping one of several\\r\\nmore lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a\\r\\nmoment, he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night, and then\\r\\nhanding his lantern to a seaman, went his way into the cabin, and did not come\\r\\nforward again until morning.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThough, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had evinced his\\r\\ncustomary activity, to call it so; yet now that the creature was dead, some\\r\\nvague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or despair, seemed working in him; as if\\r\\nthe sight of that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain;\\r\\nand though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not\\r\\none jot advance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon you would have thought\\r\\nfrom the sound on the Pequod\\'s decks, that all hands were preparing to cast\\r\\nanchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck, and\\r\\nthrust rattling out of the port-holes. But by those clanking links, the vast\\r\\ncorpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored. Tied by the head to the stern,\\r\\nand by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies with its black hull close to\\r\\nthe vessel\\'s, and seen through the darkness of the night, which obscured the\\r\\nspars and rigging aloft, the two\\xe2\\x80\\x94ship and whale, seemed yoked together like\\r\\ncolossal bullocks, whereof one reclines while the other remains standing.*\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n*A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most reliable\\r\\nhold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside, is by the flukes\\r\\nor tail; and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than\\r\\nany other (excepting the side-fins), its flexibility even in death, causes it\\r\\nto sink low beneath the surface; so that with the hand you cannot get at it\\r\\nfrom the boat, in order to put the chain round it. But this difficulty is\\r\\ningeniously overcome: a small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at\\r\\nits outer end, and a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to\\r\\nthe ship. By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other\\r\\nside of the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily\\r\\nmade to follow suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last locked fast\\r\\nround the smallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with its broad\\r\\nflukes or lobes.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIf moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known on\\r\\ndeck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an unusual but\\r\\nstill good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid\\r\\nStarbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned to him for the time the sole\\r\\nmanagement of affairs. One small, helping cause of all this liveliness in\\r\\nStubb, was soon made strangely manifest. Stubb was a high liver; he was\\r\\nsomewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"A steak, a steak, ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and cut me one\\r\\nfrom his small!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHere be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general thing,\\r\\nand according to the great military maxim, make the enemy defray the current\\r\\nexpenses of the war (at least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage), yet\\r\\nnow and then you find some of these Nantucketers who have a genuine relish for\\r\\nthat particular part of the Sperm Whale designated by Stubb; comprising the\\r\\ntapering extremity of the body.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAbout midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two lanterns of\\r\\nsperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the capstan-head,\\r\\nas if that capstan were a sideboard. Nor was Stubb the only banqueter on\\r\\nwhale\\'s flesh that night. Mingling their mumblings with his own mastications,\\r\\nthousands on thousands of sharks, swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly\\r\\nfeasted on its fatness. The few sleepers below in their bunks were often\\r\\nstartled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull, within a few\\r\\ninches of the sleepers\\' hearts. Peering over the side you could just see them\\r\\n(as before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and turning\\r\\nover on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of\\r\\nthe bigness of a human head. This particular feat of the shark seems all but\\r\\nmiraculous. How at such an apparently unassailable surface, they contrive to\\r\\ngouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the universal problem\\r\\nof all things. The mark they thus leave on the whale, may best be likened to\\r\\nthe hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThough amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks will be\\r\\nseen longingly gazing up to the ship\\'s decks, like hungry dogs round a table\\r\\nwhere red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every killed man that is\\r\\ntossed to them; and though, while the valiant butchers over the deck-table are\\r\\nthus cannibally carving each other\\'s live meat with carving-knives all gilded\\r\\nand tasselled, the sharks, also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are\\r\\nquarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat; and though, were\\r\\nyou to turn the whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the\\r\\nsame thing, that is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough for all\\r\\nparties; and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships\\r\\ncrossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy in case a\\r\\nparcel is to be carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be decently buried; and\\r\\nthough one or two other like instances might be set down, touching the set\\r\\nterms, places, and occasions, when sharks do most socially congregate, and most\\r\\nhilariously feast; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will\\r\\nfind them in such countless numbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits, than\\r\\naround a dead sperm whale, moored by night to a whaleship at sea. If you have\\r\\nnever seen that sight, then suspend your decision about the propriety of\\r\\ndevil-worship, and the expediency of conciliating the devil.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was going on so\\r\\nnigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his own epicurean\\r\\nlips.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Cook, cook!\\xe2\\x80\\x94where\\'s that old Fleece?\" he cried at length, widening his legs\\r\\nstill further, as if to form a more secure base for his supper; and, at the\\r\\nsame time darting his fork into the dish, as if stabbing with his lance; \"cook,\\r\\nyou cook!\\xe2\\x80\\x94 sail this way, cook!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously routed from\\r\\nhis warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came shambling along from his\\r\\ngalley, for, like many old blacks, there was something the matter with his\\r\\nknee-pans, which he did not keep well scoured like his other pans; this old\\r\\nFleece, as they called him, came shuffling and limping along, assisting his\\r\\nstep with his tongs, which, after a clumsy fashion, were made of straightened\\r\\niron hoops; this old Ebony floundered along, and in obedience to the word of\\r\\ncommand, came to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb\\'s sideboard; when,\\r\\nwith both hands folded before him, and resting on his two-legged cane, he bowed\\r\\nhis arched back still further over, at the same time sideways inclining his\\r\\nhead, so as to bring his best ear into play.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Cook,\" said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth,\\r\\n\"don\\'t you think this steak is rather overdone? You\\'ve been beating this steak\\r\\ntoo much, cook; it\\'s too tender. Don\\'t I always say that to be good, a\\r\\nwhale-steak must be tough? There are those sharks now over the side, don\\'t you\\r\\nsee they prefer it tough and rare? What a shindy they are kicking up! Cook, go\\r\\nand talk to \\'em; tell \\'em they are welcome to help themselves civilly, and in\\r\\nmoderation, but they must keep quiet.

Here, take this lantern,\" snatching one\\r\\nfrom his sideboard; \"now then, go and preach to them!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the deck to the\\r\\nbulwarks; and then, with one hand drooping his light low over the sea, so as to\\r\\nget a good view of his congregation, with the other hand he solemnly flourished\\r\\nhis tongs, and leaning far over the side in a mumbling voice began addressing\\r\\nthe sharks, while Stubb, softly crawling behind, overheard all that was said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Fellow-critters: I\\'se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise\\r\\ndare.

Also,\\r\\nthat in Henry VIIIth\\'s time, a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome\\r\\nreward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises,\\r\\nwhich, you remember, are a species of whale. Porpoises, indeed, are to this day\\r\\nconsidered fine eating. The meat is made into balls about the size of billiard\\r\\nballs, and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or\\r\\nveal balls. The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them. They had a\\r\\ngreat porpoise grant from the crown.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all hands be\\r\\nconsidered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but when you come to\\r\\nsit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet long, it takes away your\\r\\nappetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb, nowadays partake of\\r\\ncooked whales; but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious. We all know how they\\r\\nlive upon whales, and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda,\\r\\none of their most famous doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as\\r\\nbeing exceedingly juicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that certain\\r\\nEnglishmen, who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling\\r\\nvessel\\xe2\\x80\\x94 that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps\\r\\nof whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among the\\r\\nDutch whalemen these scraps are called \"fritters\"; which, indeed, they greatly\\r\\nresemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something like old Amsterdam\\r\\nhousewives\\' dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh. They have such an eatable look\\r\\nthat the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his exceeding\\r\\nrichness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be delicately good.\\r\\nLook at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the buffalo\\'s (which is\\r\\nesteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid pyramid of fat. But the\\r\\nspermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that is; like the transparent, half\\r\\njellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth, yet far too\\r\\nrich to supply a substitute for butter. Nevertheless, many whalemen have a\\r\\nmethod of absorbing it into some other substance, and then partaking of it. In\\r\\nthe long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip\\r\\ntheir ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many a\\r\\ngood supper have I thus made.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish. The\\r\\ncasket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two plump, whitish\\r\\nlobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large puddings), they are then\\r\\nmixed with flour, and cooked into a most delectable mess, in flavor somewhat\\r\\nresembling calves\\' head, which is quite a dish among some epicures; and every\\r\\none knows that some young bucks among the epicures, by continually dining upon\\r\\ncalves\\' brains, by and by get to have a little brains of their own, so as to be\\r\\nable to tell a calf\\'s head from their own heads; which, indeed, requires\\r\\nuncommon discrimination. And that is the reason why a young buck with an\\r\\nintelligent looking calf\\'s head before him, is somehow one of the saddest\\r\\nsights you can see. The head looks a sort of reproachfully at him, with an \"Et\\r\\ntu Brute!\" expression.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that\\r\\nlandsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence; that appears to\\r\\nresult, in some way, from the consideration before mentioned: i.e. that a man\\r\\nshould eat a newly murdered thing of the sea, and eat it too by its own light.\\r\\nBut no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer;\\r\\nperhaps he was hung; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly\\r\\nwould have been; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does. Go to the\\r\\nmeat-market of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at\\r\\nthe long rows of dead quadrupeds. Does not that sight take a tooth out of the\\r\\ncannibal\\'s jaw? Cannibals? who is not a cannibal? I tell you it will be more\\r\\ntolerable for the Fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his cellar\\r\\nagainst a coming famine; it will be more tolerable for that provident Fejee, I\\r\\nsay, in the day of judgment, than for thee, civilized and enlightened gourmand,\\r\\nwho nailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy\\r\\npate-de-foie-gras.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is adding\\r\\ninsult to injury, is it? Look at your knife-handle, there, my civilized and\\r\\nenlightened gourmand, dining off that roast beef, what is that handle made\\r\\nof?\\xe2\\x80\\x94what but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are eating? And what\\r\\ndo you pick your teeth with, after devouring that fat goose? With a feather of\\r\\nthe same fowl. And with what quill did the Secretary of the Society for the\\r\\nSuppression of Cruelty to Ganders formally indite his circulars?

For that\\r\\nbusiness is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very soon completed; and\\r\\nrequires all hands to set about it. Therefore, the common usage is to take in\\r\\nall sail; lash the helm a\\'lee; and then send every one below to his hammock\\r\\ntill daylight, with the reservation that, until that time, anchor-watches shall\\r\\nbe kept; that is, two and two for an hour, each couple, the crew in rotation\\r\\nshall mount the deck to see that all goes well.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan will not\\r\\nanswer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round the\\r\\nmoored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a stretch, little\\r\\nmore than the skeleton would be visible by morning. In most other parts of the\\r\\nocean, however, where these fish do not so largely abound, their wondrous\\r\\nvoracity can be at times considerably diminished, by vigorously stirring them\\r\\nup with sharp whaling-spades, a procedure notwithstanding, which, in some\\r\\ninstances, only seems to tickle them into still greater activity. But it was\\r\\nnot thus in the present case with the Pequod\\'s sharks; though, to be sure, any\\r\\nman unaccustomed to such sights, to have looked over her side that night, would\\r\\nhave almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese, and those sharks\\r\\nthe maggots in it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper was\\r\\nconcluded; and when, accordingly Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on deck,\\r\\nno small excitement was created among the sharks; for immediately suspending\\r\\nthe cutting stages over the side, and lowering three lanterns, so that they\\r\\ncast long gleams of light over the turbid sea, these two mariners, darting\\r\\ntheir long whaling-spades,* kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks, by\\r\\nstriking the keen steel deep into their skulls, seemingly their only vital\\r\\npart. But in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts, the\\r\\nmarksmen could not always hit their mark; and this brought about new\\r\\nrevelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe. They viciously snapped, not\\r\\nonly at each other\\'s disembowelments, but like flexible bows, bent round, and\\r\\nbit their own; till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by the\\r\\nsame mouth, to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound. Nor was this all. It\\r\\nwas unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures. A sort of\\r\\ngeneric or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones,\\r\\nafter what might be called the individual life had departed. Killed and hoisted\\r\\non deck for the sake of his skin, one of these sharks almost took poor\\r\\nQueequeg\\'s hand off, when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his murderous\\r\\njaw.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n*The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel; is about\\r\\nthe bigness of a man\\'s spread hand; and in general shape, corresponds to the\\r\\ngarden implement after which it is named; only its sides are perfectly flat,\\r\\nand its upper end considerably narrower than the lower. This weapon is always\\r\\nkept as sharp as possible; and when being used is occasionally honed, just like\\r\\na razor. In its socket, a stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is\\r\\ninserted for a handle.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Queequeg no care what god made him shark,\" said the savage, agonizingly\\r\\nlifting his hand up and down; \"wedder Fejee god or Nantucket god; but de god\\r\\nwat made shark must be one dam Ingin.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 67</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCutting In\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed! Ex officio professors\\r\\nof Sabbath breaking are all whalemen. The ivory Pequod was turned into what\\r\\nseemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher. You would have thought we were\\r\\noffering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous things\\r\\ncomprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green, and which no single man\\r\\ncan possibly lift\\xe2\\x80\\x94this vast bunch of grapes was swayed up to the main-top and\\r\\nfirmly lashed to the lower mast-head, the strongest point anywhere above a\\r\\nship\\'s deck. The end of the hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies,\\r\\nwas then conducted to the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles was\\r\\nswung over the whale; to this block the great blubber hook, weighing some one\\r\\nhundred pounds, was attached. And now suspended in stages over the side,\\r\\nStarbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their long spades, began cutting a\\r\\nhole in the body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the\\r\\ntwo side-fins. This done, a broad, semicircular line is cut round the hole, the\\r\\nhook is inserted, and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now\\r\\ncommence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass. When instantly, the entire\\r\\nship careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like the nailheads of\\r\\nan old house in frosty weather; she trembles, quivers, and nods her frighted\\r\\nmast-heads to the sky. More and more she leans over to the whale, while every\\r\\ngasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows;\\r\\ntill at last, a swift, startling snap is heard; with a great swash the ship\\r\\nrolls upwards and backwards from the whale, and the triumphant tackle rises\\r\\ninto sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip\\r\\nof blubber. Now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does\\r\\nan orange, so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is\\r\\nsometimes stripped by spiralizing it. For the strain constantly kept up by the\\r\\nwindlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water, and as\\r\\nthe blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the \"scarf,\"\\r\\nsimultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb, the mates; and just as\\r\\nfast as it is thus peeled off, and indeed by that very act itself, it is all\\r\\nthe time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the\\r\\nmain-top; the men at the windlass then cease heaving, and for a moment or two\\r\\nthe prodigious blood-dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the\\r\\nsky, and every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else\\r\\nit may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOne of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon called a\\r\\nboarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a\\r\\nconsiderable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass. Into this hole, the\\r\\nend of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a\\r\\nhold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for what follows. Whereupon, this\\r\\naccomplished swordsman, warning all hands to stand off, once more makes a\\r\\nscientific dash at the mass, and with a few sidelong, desperate, lunging,\\r\\nslicings, severs it completely in twain; so that while the short lower part is\\r\\nstill fast, the long upper strip, called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is\\r\\nall ready for lowering. The heavers forward now resume their song, and while\\r\\nthe one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other\\r\\nis slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the main\\r\\nhatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber-room.\\r\\nInto this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long\\r\\nblanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents. And thus the\\r\\nwork proceeds; the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously; both whale\\r\\nand windlass heaving, the heavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling,\\r\\nthe mates scarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by\\r\\nway of assuaging the general friction.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 68</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Blanket\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin of the\\r\\nwhale. I have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen afloat, and\\r\\nlearned naturalists ashore. My original opinion remains unchanged; but it is\\r\\nonly an opinion.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe question is, what and where is the skin of the whale. Already you know what\\r\\nhis blubber is. That blubber is something of the consistence of firm,\\r\\nclose-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and ranges from\\r\\neight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature\\'s skin\\r\\nas being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet in point of fact these\\r\\nare no arguments against such a presumption; because you cannot raise any other\\r\\ndense enveloping layer from the whale\\'s body but that same blubber; and the\\r\\noutermost enveloping layer of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be\\r\\nbut the skin? True, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you may scrape\\r\\noff with your hand an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat\\r\\nresembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only it is almost as flexible and\\r\\nsoft as satin; that is, previous to being dried, when it not only contracts and\\r\\nthickens, but becomes rather hard and brittle. I have several such dried bits,\\r\\nwhich I use for marks in my whale-books. It is transparent, as I said before;\\r\\nand being laid upon the printed page, I have sometimes pleased myself with\\r\\nfancying it exerted a magnifying influence. At any rate, it is pleasant to read\\r\\nabout whales through their own spectacles, as you may say. But what I am\\r\\ndriving at here is this. That same infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which,\\r\\nI admit, invests the entire body of the whale, is not so much to be regarded as\\r\\nthe skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to speak; for it were\\r\\nsimply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is\\r\\nthinner and more tender than the skin of a new-born child. But no more of this.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAssuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin, as in\\r\\nthe case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one hundred\\r\\nbarrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity, or rather weight,\\r\\nthat oil, in its expressed state, is only three fourths, and not the entire\\r\\nsubstance of the coat; some idea may hence be had of the enormousness of that\\r\\nanimated mass, a mere part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of\\r\\nliquid as that. Reckoning ten barrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net\\r\\nweight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whale\\'s skin.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the many\\r\\nmarvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and\\r\\nre-crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array, something like those\\r\\nin the finest Italian line engravings. But these marks do not seem to be\\r\\nimpressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen\\r\\nthrough it, as if they were engraved upon the body itself. Nor is this all. In\\r\\nsome instances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as in a\\r\\nveritable engraving, but afford the ground for far other delineations. These\\r\\nare hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls\\r\\nof pyramids hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to use in the present\\r\\nconnexion. By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in\\r\\nparticular, I was much struck with a plate representing the old Indian\\r\\ncharacters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the\\r\\nUpper Mississippi. Like those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked whale\\r\\nremains undecipherable. This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another\\r\\nthing. Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm Whale\\r\\npresents, he not seldom displays the back, and more especially his flanks,\\r\\neffaced in great part of the regular linear appearance, by reason of numerous\\r\\nrude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random aspect. I should say that\\r\\nthose New England rocks on the seacoast, which Agassiz imagines to bear the\\r\\nmarks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs\\xe2\\x80\\x94I should say,\\r\\nthat those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular.\\r\\nIt also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by\\r\\nhostile contact with other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large,\\r\\nfull-grown bulls of the species.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale.\\r\\nIt has already been said, that it is stript from him in long pieces, called\\r\\nblanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very happy and significant.\\r\\nFor the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or\\r\\ncounterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho slipt over his head, and\\r\\nskirting his extremity. It is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body,\\r\\nthat the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers, in all\\r\\nseas, times, and tides. What would become of a Greenland whale, say, in those\\r\\nshuddering, icy seas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True,\\r\\nother fish are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but these,\\r\\nbe it observed, are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very bellies are\\r\\nrefrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg, as\\r\\na traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire; whereas, like man, the\\r\\nwhale has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his blood, and he dies. How wonderful is\\r\\nit then\\xe2\\x80\\x94except after explanation\\xe2\\x80\\x94that this great monster, to whom corporeal\\r\\nwarmth is as indispensable as it is to man; how wonderful that he should be\\r\\nfound at home, immersed to his lips for life in those Arctic waters! where,\\r\\nwhen seamen fall overboard, they are sometimes found, months afterwards,\\r\\nperpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found\\r\\nglued in amber. But more surprising is it to know, as has been proved by\\r\\nexperiment, that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo\\r\\nnegro in summer.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong individual\\r\\nvitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare virtue of interior\\r\\nspaciousness. Oh, man! admire and model thyself after the whale! Do thou, too,\\r\\nremain warm among ice. Do thou, too, live in this world without being of it. Be\\r\\ncool at the equator; keep thy blood fluid at the Pole. Like the great dome of\\r\\nSt. Peter\\'s, and like the great whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a\\r\\ntemperature of thine own.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things! Of erections, how few\\r\\nare domed like St. Peter\\'s! of creatures, how few vast as the whale!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 69</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Funeral\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHaul in the chains!

The peeled white body of the\\r\\nbeheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in hue, it has\\r\\nnot perceptibly lost anything in bulk. It is still colossal. Slowly it floats\\r\\nmore and more away, the water round it torn and splashed by the insatiate\\r\\nsharks, and the air above vexed with rapacious flights of screaming fowls,\\r\\nwhose beaks are like so many insulting poniards in the whale.The vast white\\r\\nheadless phantom floats further and further from the ship, and every rod that\\r\\nit so floats, what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls,\\r\\naugment the murderous din. For hours and hours from the almost stationary ship\\r\\nthat hideous sight is seen. Beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky, upon the\\r\\nfair face of the pleasant sea, wafted by the joyous breezes, that great mass of\\r\\ndeath floats on and on, till lost in infinite perspectives.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere\\'s a most doleful and most mocking funeral! The sea-vultures all in pious\\r\\nmourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or speckled. In life but\\r\\nfew of them would have helped the whale, I ween, if peradventure he had needed\\r\\nit; but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce. Oh,\\r\\nhorrible vulturism of earth! from which not the mightiest whale is free.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor is this the end. Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost survives and\\r\\nhovers over it to scare. Espied by some timid man-of-war or blundering\\r\\ndiscovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls,\\r\\nnevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun, and the white\\r\\nspray heaving high against it; straightway the whale\\'s unharming corpse, with\\r\\ntrembling fingers is set down in the log\\xe2\\x80\\x94shoals, rocks, and breakers\\r\\nhereabouts: beware!

Now, the beheading of the Sperm Whale is a\\r\\nscientific anatomical feat, upon which experienced whale surgeons very much\\r\\npride themselves: and not without reason.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nConsider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck; on the\\r\\ncontrary, where his head and body seem to join, there, in that very place, is\\r\\nthe thickest part of him. Remember, also, that the surgeon must operate from\\r\\nabove, some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject, and that\\r\\nsubject almost hidden in a discolored, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and\\r\\nbursting sea. Bear in mind, too, that under these untoward circumstances he has\\r\\nto cut many feet deep in the flesh; and in that subterraneous manner, without\\r\\nso much as getting one single peep into the ever-contracting gash thus made, he\\r\\nmust skilfully steer clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts, and exactly\\r\\ndivide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull. Do\\r\\nyou not marvel, then, at Stubb\\'s boast, that he demanded but ten minutes to\\r\\nbehead a sperm whale?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till\\r\\nthe body is stripped. That done, if it belong to a small whale it is hoisted on\\r\\ndeck to be deliberately disposed of. But, with a full grown leviathan this is\\r\\nimpossible; for the sperm whale\\'s head embraces nearly one third of his entire\\r\\nbulk, and completely to suspend such a burden as that, even by the immense\\r\\ntackles of a whaler, this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch\\r\\nbarn in jewellers\\' scales.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Pequod\\'s whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head was\\r\\nhoisted against the ship\\'s side\\xe2\\x80\\x94about half way out of the sea, so that it might\\r\\nyet in great part be buoyed up by its native element. And there with the\\r\\nstrained craft steeply leaning over to it, by reason of the enormous downward\\r\\ndrag from the lower mast-head, and every yard-arm on that side projecting like\\r\\na crane over the waves; there, that blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod\\'s\\r\\nwaist like the giant Holofernes\\'s from the girdle of Judith.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went below to\\r\\ntheir dinner. Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now deserted deck.\\r\\nAn intense copper calm, like a universal yellow lotus, was more and more\\r\\nunfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone from his\\r\\ncabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to gaze over the side,\\r\\nthen slowly getting into the main-chains he took Stubb\\'s long spade still\\r\\nremaining there after the whale\\'s decapitation and striking it into the lower\\r\\npart of the half-suspended mass, placed its other end crutchwise under one arm,\\r\\nand so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so intense a\\r\\ncalm, it seemed the Sphynx\\'s in the desert. \"Speak, thou vast and venerable\\r\\nhead,\" muttered Ahab, \"which, though ungarnished with a beard, yet here and\\r\\nthere lookest hoary with mosses; speak, mighty head, and tell us the secret\\r\\nthing that is in thee. Of all divers, thou hast dived the deepest.

Thou\\r\\nsaw\\'st the locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship; heart to heart\\r\\nthey sank beneath the exulting wave; true to each other, when heaven seemed\\r\\nfalse to them. Thou saw\\'st the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the\\r\\nmidnight deck; for hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw;\\r\\nand his murderers still sailed on unharmed\\xe2\\x80\\x94 while swift lightnings shivered the\\r\\nneighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched,\\r\\nlonging arms.

But as she was so far to windward, and shooting by,\\r\\napparently making a passage to some other ground, the Pequod could not hope to\\r\\nreach her. So the signal was set to see what response would be made.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHere be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships of the\\r\\nAmerican Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which signals being\\r\\ncollected in a book with the names of the respective vessels attached, every\\r\\ncaptain is provided with it. Thereby, the whale commanders are enabled to\\r\\nrecognise each other upon the ocean, even at considerable distance, and with no\\r\\nsmall facility.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Pequod\\'s signal was at last responded to by the stranger\\'s setting her own;\\r\\nwhich proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket. Squaring her yards, she\\r\\nbore down, ranged abeam under the Pequod\\'s lee, and lowered a boat; it soon\\r\\ndrew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was being rigged by Starbuck\\'s order to\\r\\naccommodate the visiting captain, the stranger in question waved his hand from\\r\\nhis boat\\'s stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary. It\\r\\nturned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and that\\r\\nMayhew, her captain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod\\'s company. For, though\\r\\nhimself and the boat\\'s crew remained untainted, and though his ship was half a\\r\\nrifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between;\\r\\nyet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land, he\\r\\nperemptorily refused to come into direct contact with the Pequod.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an interval of\\r\\nsome few yards between itself and the ship, the Jeroboam\\'s boat by the\\r\\noccasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the Pequod, as she\\r\\nheavily forged through the sea (for by this time it blew very fresh), with her\\r\\nmain-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times by the sudden onset of a large\\r\\nrolling wave, the boat would be pushed some way ahead; but would be soon\\r\\nskilfully brought to her proper bearings again. Subject to this, and other the\\r\\nlike interruptions now and then, a conversation was sustained between the two\\r\\nparties; but at intervals not without still another interruption of a very\\r\\ndifferent sort.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPulling an oar in the Jeroboam\\'s boat, was a man of a singular appearance, even\\r\\nin that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up all totalities.\\r\\nHe was a small, short, youngish man, sprinkled all over his face with freckles,\\r\\nand wearing redundant yellow hair. A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a\\r\\nfaded walnut tinge enveloped him; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled\\r\\nup on his wrists. A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had exclaimed\\xe2\\x80\\x94 \"That\\'s\\r\\nhe! that\\'s he!\\xe2\\x80\\x94the long-togged scaramouch the Town-Ho\\'s company told us of!\"\\r\\nStubb here alluded to a strange story told of the Jeroboam, and a certain man\\r\\namong her crew, some time previous when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho. According\\r\\nto this account and what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the\\r\\nscaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody\\r\\nin the Jeroboam. His story was this:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna Shakers,\\r\\nwhere he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret meetings having\\r\\nseveral times descended from heaven by the way of a trapdoor, announcing the\\r\\nspeedy opening of the seventh vial, which he carried in his vest-pocket; but,\\r\\nwhich, instead of containing gunpowder, was supposed to be charged with\\r\\nlaudanum. A strange, apostolic whim having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna\\r\\nfor Nantucket, where, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed a\\r\\nsteady, common sense exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand candidate\\r\\nfor the Jeroboam\\'s whaling voyage. They engaged him; but straightway upon the\\r\\nship\\'s getting out of sight of land, his insanity broke out in a freshet. He\\r\\nannounced himself as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded the captain to jump\\r\\noverboard. He published his manifesto, whereby he set himself forth as the\\r\\ndeliverer of the isles of the sea and vicar-general of all Oceanica. The\\r\\nunflinching earnestness with which he declared these things;\\xe2\\x80\\x94the dark, daring\\r\\nplay of his sleepless, excited imagination, and all the preternatural terrors\\r\\nof real delirium, united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of\\r\\nthe ignorant crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness. Moreover, they were afraid\\r\\nof him. As such a man, however, was not of much practical use in the ship,\\r\\nespecially as he refused to work except when he pleased, the incredulous\\r\\ncaptain would fain have been rid of him; but apprised that that individual\\'s\\r\\nintention was to land him in the first convenient port, the archangel forthwith\\r\\nopened all his seals and vials\\xe2\\x80\\x94devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional\\r\\nperdition, in case this intention was carried out. So strongly did he work upon\\r\\nhis disciples among the crew, that at last in a body they went to the captain\\r\\nand told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of them would remain.\\r\\nHe was therefore forced to relinquish his plan. Nor would they permit Gabriel\\r\\nto be any way maltreated, say or do what he would; so that it came to pass that\\r\\nGabriel had the complete freedom of the ship. The consequence of all this was,\\r\\nthat the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and mates; and since\\r\\nthe epidemic had broken out, he carried a higher hand than ever; declaring that\\r\\nthe plague, as he called it, was at his sole command; nor should it be stayed\\r\\nbut according to his good pleasure. The sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed,\\r\\nand some of them fawned before him; in obedience to his instructions, sometimes\\r\\nrendering him personal homage, as to a god. Such things may seem incredible;\\r\\nbut, however wondrous, they are true. Nor is the history of fanatics half so\\r\\nstriking in respect to the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself,\\r\\nas his measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others. But it is\\r\\ntime to return to the Pequod.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I fear not thy epidemic, man,\" said Ahab from the bulwarks, to Captain Mayhew,\\r\\nwho stood in the boat\\'s stern; \"come on board.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut now Gabriel started to his feet.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious!<br>\\r\\nBeware of the horrible plague!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Gabriel! Gabriel!\" cried Captain Mayhew; \"thou must either-\" But that instant\\r\\na headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its seethings drowned all speech.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Hast thou seen the White Whale?\" demanded Ahab, when the boat drifted back.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk!<br>\\r\\nBeware of the horrible tail!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I tell thee again, Gabriel, that-\" But again the boat tore ahead as if dragged\\r\\nby fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while a succession of riotous\\r\\nwaves rolled by which by one of those occasional caprices of the seas were\\r\\ntumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the hoisted sperm whale\\'s head jogged about\\r\\nvery violently, and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more\\r\\napprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story concerning Moby\\r\\nDick; not, however, without frequent interruptions from Gabriel, whenever his\\r\\nname was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking a\\r\\nwhale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of Moby Dick,\\r\\nand the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this intelligence, Gabriel\\r\\nsolemnly warned the captain against attacking the White Whale, in case the\\r\\nmonster should be seen; in his gibbering insanity, pronouncing the White Whale\\r\\nto be no less a being than the Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the\\r\\nBible. But when, some year or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from\\r\\nthe mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardor to encounter him; and\\r\\nthe captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity,\\r\\ndespite all the archangel\\'s denunciations and forewarnings, Macey succeeded in\\r\\npersuading five men to man his boat. With them he pushed off; and, after much\\r\\nweary pulling, and many perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in\\r\\ngetting one iron fast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal\\r\\nmast-head, was tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth\\r\\nprophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. Now,\\r\\nwhile Macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat\\'s bow, and with all the\\r\\nreckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale,\\r\\nand essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a broad white\\r\\nshadow rose from the sea; by its quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the\\r\\nbreath out of the bodies of the oarsmen. Next instant, the luckless mate, so\\r\\nfull of furious life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc in\\r\\nhis descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards. Not a chip\\r\\nof the boat was harmed, nor a hair of any oarsman\\'s head; but the mate for ever\\r\\nsank.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the Sperm-Whale\\r\\nFishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any. Sometimes, nothing is\\r\\ninjured but the man who is thus annihilated; oftener the boat\\'s bow is knocked\\r\\noff, or the thigh-board, on which the headsman stands, is torn from its place\\r\\nand accompanies the body. But strangest of all is the circumstance, that in\\r\\nmore instances than one, when the body has been recovered, not a single mark of\\r\\nviolence is discernible the man being stark dead.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly descried from\\r\\nthe ship. Raising a piercing shriek\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"The vial! the vial!\" Gabriel called off\\r\\nthe terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of the whale. This terrible\\r\\nevent clothed the archangel with added influence; because his credulous\\r\\ndisciples believed that he had specifically fore-announced it, instead of only\\r\\nmaking a general prophecy, which any one might have done, and so have chanced\\r\\nto hit one of many marks in the wide margin allowed. He became a nameless\\r\\nterror to the ship.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to him, that the\\r\\nstranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended to hunt the\\r\\nWhite Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which Ahab answered\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Aye.\"\\r\\nStraightway, then, Gabriel once more started to his feet, glaring upon the old\\r\\nman, and vehemently exclaimed, with downward pointed finger\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Think, think of\\r\\nthe blasphemer\\xe2\\x80\\x94 dead, and down there!\\xe2\\x80\\x94beware of the blasphemer\\'s end!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAhab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, \"Captain, I have just\\r\\nbethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy officers, if I\\r\\nmistake not. Starbuck, look over the bag.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEvery whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships, whose\\r\\ndelivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed, depends upon the mere\\r\\nchance of encountering them in the four oceans. Thus, most letters never reach\\r\\ntheir mark; and many are only received after attaining an age of two or three\\r\\nyears or more.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSoon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. It was sorely tumbled, damp,\\r\\nand covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in consequence of being kept in\\r\\na dark locker of the cabin. Of such a letter, Death himself might well have\\r\\nbeen the post-boy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Can\\'st not read it?\" cried Ahab. \"Give it me, man. Aye, aye, aye it\\'s but a\\r\\ndim scrawl;\\xe2\\x80\\x94what\\'s this?\" As he was studying it out, Starbuck took a long\\r\\ncutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to insert the\\r\\nletter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat, without its coming any\\r\\ncloser to the ship.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMeantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, \"Mr. Har\\xe2\\x80\\x94 yes, Mr. Harry\\xe2\\x80\\x94(a\\r\\nwoman\\'s pinny hand,\\xe2\\x80\\x94the man\\'s wife, I\\'ll wager)\\xe2\\x80\\x94Aye\\xe2\\x80\\x94Mr. Harry Macey, Ship\\r\\nJeroboam; why it\\'s Macey, and he\\'s dead!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife,\" sighed Mayhew; \"but let me have\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Nay, keep it thyself,\" cried Gabriel to Ahab; \"thou art soon going that way.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Curses throttle thee!\" yelled Ahab. \"Captain Mayhew, stand by now to receive\\r\\nit\"; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck\\'s hands, he caught it in the\\r\\nslit of the pole, and reached it over towards the boat. But as he did so, the\\r\\noarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing; the boat drifted a little towards the\\r\\nship\\'s stern; so that, as if by magic, the letter suddenly ranged along with\\r\\nGabriel\\'s eager hand. He clutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and\\r\\nimpaling the letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at\\r\\nAhab\\'s feet. Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their\\r\\noars, and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the\\r\\nwhale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 72</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Monkey-Rope\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there is\\r\\nmuch running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands are wanted here,\\r\\nand then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in any one place;\\r\\nfor at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere. It is much\\r\\nthe same with him who endeavors the description of the scene. We must now\\r\\nretrace our way a little. It was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in\\r\\nthe whale\\'s back, the blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there\\r\\ncut by the spades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as\\r\\nthat same hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my particular\\r\\nfriend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the\\r\\nmonster\\'s back for the special purpose referred to. But in very many cases,\\r\\ncircumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the\\r\\nwhole tensing or stripping operation is concluded. The whale, be it observed,\\r\\nlies almost entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated upon. So\\r\\ndown there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer\\r\\nflounders about, half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass\\r\\nrevolves like a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg\\r\\nfigured in the Highland costume\\xe2\\x80\\x94 a shirt and socks\\xe2\\x80\\x94in which to my eyes, at\\r\\nleast, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to\\r\\nobserve him, as will presently be seen.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBeing the savage\\'s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar in his\\r\\nboat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him\\r\\nwhile taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead whale\\'s back. You have\\r\\nseen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long cord. Just so, from the\\r\\nship\\'s steep side, did I hold Queequeg down there in the sea, by what is\\r\\ntechnically called in the fishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of\\r\\ncanvas belted round his waist.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we proceed\\r\\nfurther, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both ends; fast to\\r\\nQueequeg\\'s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow leather one. So that for\\r\\nbetter or for worse, we two, for the time, were wedded; and should poor\\r\\nQueequeg sink to rise no more, then both usage and honor demanded, that instead\\r\\nof cutting the cord, it should drag me down in his wake. So, then, an elongated\\r\\nSiamese ligature united us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor\\r\\ncould I any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond\\r\\nentailed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that while\\r\\nearnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to perceive that my own\\r\\nindividuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two; that my free will\\r\\nhad received a mortal wound; and that another\\'s mistake or misfortune might\\r\\nplunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death. Therefore, I saw that\\r\\nhere was a sort of interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never\\r\\ncould have so gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering\\xe2\\x80\\x94while I\\r\\njerked him now and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten\\r\\nto jam him\\xe2\\x80\\x94still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine\\r\\nwas the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most cases,\\r\\nhe, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a plurality of other\\r\\nmortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your apothecary by mistake sends\\r\\nyou poison in your pills, you die. True, you may say that, by exceeding\\r\\ncaution, you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances\\r\\nof life. But handle Queequeg\\'s monkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he\\r\\njerked it so, that I came very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly\\r\\nforget that, do what I would, I only had the management of one end of it.*\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n*The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod that\\r\\nthe monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This improvement upon the\\r\\noriginal usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb, in order to afford\\r\\nto the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the\\r\\nfaithfulness and vigilance of his monkey-rope holder.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the whale and\\r\\nthe ship\\xe2\\x80\\x94where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant rolling and\\r\\nswaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to.\\r\\nUnappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night, the sharks now\\r\\nfreshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow\\r\\nfrom the carcass\\xe2\\x80\\x94the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them aside with\\r\\nhis floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted\\r\\nby such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark\\r\\nwill seldom touch a man.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous\\r\\nfinger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them. Accordingly,\\r\\nbesides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then jerked the poor fellow from\\r\\ntoo close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark\\xe2\\x80\\x94he\\r\\nwas provided with still another protection. Suspended over the side in one of\\r\\nthe stages, Tashtego and Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple\\r\\nof keen whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could\\r\\nreach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and\\r\\nbenevolent of them. They meant Queequeg\\'s best happiness, I admit; but in their\\r\\nhasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that both he and the\\r\\nsharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled water, those indiscreet\\r\\nspades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tall. But poor\\r\\nQueequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping there with that great iron hook\\xe2\\x80\\x94poor\\r\\nQueequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his Yojo, and gave up his life into the\\r\\nhands of his gods.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWell, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in and then\\r\\nslacked off the rope to every swell of the sea\\xe2\\x80\\x94 what matters it, after all? Are\\r\\nyou not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world?\\r\\nThat unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those sharks, your foes; those\\r\\nspades, your friends; and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad\\r\\npickle and peril, poor lad.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now, as with\\r\\nblue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains\\r\\nand stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side; the steward\\r\\nadvances, and with a benevolent, consolatory glance hands him\\xe2\\x80\\x94what? Some hot\\r\\nCognac? No! hands him, ye gods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Ginger? Do I smell ginger?\" suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near. \"Yes, this\\r\\nmust be ginger,\" peering into the as yet untasted cup. Then standing as if\\r\\nincredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly\\r\\nsaying, \"Ginger? ginger? and will you have the goodness to tell me, Mr.\\r\\nDough-Boy, where lies the virtue of ginger? Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel\\r\\nyou use, Dough-boy, to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal?

Is the\\r\\nsteward an apothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters\\r\\nby which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I trust not,\" said Starbuck, \"it is poor stuff enough.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Aye, aye, steward,\" cried Stubb, \"we\\'ll teach you to drug it harpooneer; none\\r\\nof your apothecary\\'s medicine here; you want to poison us, do ye? You have got\\r\\nout insurances on our lives and want to give way with their oars, and pocket\\r\\nthe proceeds, do ye?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"It was not me,\" cried Dough-Boy, \"it was Aunt Charity that brought the ginger\\r\\non board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits, but only this\\r\\nginger-jub\\xe2\\x80\\x94so she called it.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to the\\r\\nlockers, and get something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr. Starbuck. It is\\r\\nthe captain\\'s orders\\xe2\\x80\\x94 grog for the harpooneer on a whale.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Enough,\" replied Starbuck, \"only don\\'t hit him again, but-\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of that\\r\\nsort; and this fellow\\'s a weazel. What were you about saying, sir?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a sort of\\r\\ntea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong spirits, and was handed to\\r\\nQueequeg; the second was Aunt Charity\\'s gift, and that was freely given to the\\r\\nwaves.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 73</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nStubb and Flask Kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk Over Him\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale\\'s prodigious\\r\\nhead hanging to the Pequod\\'s side. But we must let it continue hanging there a\\r\\nwhile till we can get a chance to attend to it. For the present other matters\\r\\npress, and the best we can do now for the head, is to pray heaven the tackles\\r\\nmay hold.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually drifted into\\r\\na sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit, gave unusual tokens of\\r\\nthe vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the Leviathan that but few supposed\\r\\nto be at this particular time lurking anywhere near. And though all hands\\r\\ncommonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures; and though the\\r\\nPequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all, and though she had\\r\\npassed numbers of them near the Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that\\r\\na Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all,\\r\\nthe announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day, if\\r\\nopportunity offered.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two boats,\\r\\nStubb\\'s and Flask\\'s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further and further\\r\\naway, they at last became almost invisible to the men at the masthead. But\\r\\nsuddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water, and\\r\\nsoon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast. An\\r\\ninterval passed and the boats were in plain sight, in the act of being dragged\\r\\nright towards the ship by the towing whale. So close did the monster come to\\r\\nthe hull, that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going\\r\\ndown in a maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared\\r\\nfrom view, as if diving under the keel. \"Cut, cut!\" was the cry from the ship\\r\\nto the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being brought with\\r\\na deadly dash against the vessel\\'s side. But having plenty of line yet in the\\r\\ntubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they paid out abundance of rope,\\r\\nand at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the\\r\\nship. For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical; for while they\\r\\nstill slacked out the tightened line in one direction, and still plied their\\r\\noars in another, the contending strain threatened to take them under. But it\\r\\nwas only a few feet advance they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they\\r\\ndid gain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning\\r\\nalong the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship, suddenly rose\\r\\nto view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so flinging off its\\r\\ndrippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water, while\\r\\nthe whale beyond also rose to sight, and once more the boats were free to fly.\\r\\nBut the fagged whale abated his speed, and blindly altering his course, went\\r\\nround the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him, so that they\\r\\nperformed a complete circuit.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMeantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close flanking him\\r\\non both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance; and thus round and\\r\\nround the Pequod the battle went, while the multitudes of sharks that had\\r\\nbefore swum round the Sperm Whale\\'s body, rushed to the fresh blood that was\\r\\nspilled, thirstily drinking at every new gash, as the eager Israelites did at\\r\\nthe new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten rock.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he turned\\r\\nupon his back a corpse.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhile the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes, and in\\r\\nother ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some conversation ensued\\r\\nbetween them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,\" said Stubb, not\\r\\nwithout some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a\\r\\nleviathan.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Wants with it?\" said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat\\'s bow, \"did\\r\\nyou never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale\\'s head hoisted on\\r\\nher starboard side, and at the same time a Right Whale\\'s on the larboard; did\\r\\nyou never hear, Stubb, that that ship can never afterwards capsize?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Why not?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so, and he\\r\\nseems to know all about ships\\' charms. But I sometimes think he\\'ll charm the\\r\\nship to no good at last. I don\\'t half like that chap, Stubb.

Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I don\\'t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked one, I tell\\r\\nye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the old flag-ship once,\\r\\nswitching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike, and inquiring if the\\r\\nold governor was at home. Well, he was at home, and asked the devil what he\\r\\nwanted. The devil, switching his hoofs, up and says, \\'I want John.\\' \\'What for?\\'\\r\\nsays the old governor. \\'What business is that of yours,\\' says the devil,\\r\\ngetting mad,\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\'I want to use him.\\' \\'Take him,\\' says the governor\\xe2\\x80\\x94 and by the\\r\\nLord, Flask, if the devil didn\\'t give John the Asiatic cholera before he got\\r\\nthrough with him, I\\'ll eat this whale in one mouthful.

Well, then, pull ahead, and let\\'s get the whale alongside.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I think I remember some such story as you were telling,\" said Flask, when at\\r\\nlast the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship,\\r\\n\"but I can\\'t remember where.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Three Spaniards?

Damn the devil, Flask; do you suppose I\\'m\\r\\nafraid of the devil? Who\\'s afraid of him, except the old governor who daresn\\'t\\r\\ncatch him and put him in double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about\\r\\nkidnapping people; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the people the\\r\\ndevil kidnapped, he\\'d roast for him? There\\'s a governor!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Do I suppose it? You\\'ll know it before long, Flask. But I am going now to keep\\r\\na sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very suspicious going on, I\\'ll\\r\\njust take him by the nape of his neck, and say\\xe2\\x80\\x94Look here, Beelzebub, you don\\'t\\r\\ndo it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord I\\'ll make a grab into his pocket\\r\\nfor his tail, take it to the capstan, and give him such a wrenching and\\r\\nheaving, that his tail will come short off at the stump\\xe2\\x80\\x94do you see; and then, I\\r\\nrather guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion, he\\'ll sneak\\r\\noff without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Do with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;\\xe2\\x80\\x94what else?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along, Stubb?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side, where fluke\\r\\nchains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Didn\\'t I tell you so?\" said Flask; \"yes, you\\'ll soon see this right whale\\'s\\r\\nhead hoisted up opposite that parmacety\\'s.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn good time, Flask\\'s saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply leaned\\r\\nover towards the sperm whale\\'s head, now, by the counterpoise of both heads,\\r\\nshe regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may well believe. So,\\r\\nwhen on one side you hoist in Locke\\'s head, you go over that way; but now, on\\r\\nthe other side, hoist in Kant\\'s and you come back again; but in very poor\\r\\nplight. Thus, some minds for ever keep trimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all\\r\\nthese thunder-heads overboard, and then you will float light and right.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the ship, the\\r\\nsame preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm\\r\\nwhale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut off whole, but in the\\r\\nformer the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck, with all\\r\\nthe well known black bone attached to what is called the crown-piece. But\\r\\nnothing like this, in the present case, had been done. The carcases of both\\r\\nwhales had dropped astern; and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a\\r\\nmule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMeantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale\\'s head, and ever and anon\\r\\nglancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand. And Ahab\\r\\nchanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his shadow; while, if the\\r\\nParsee\\'s shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with, and lengthen\\r\\nAhab\\'s. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish speculations were bandied among them,\\r\\nconcerning all these passing things.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 74</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Sperm Whale\\'s Head - Contrasted View\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHere, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us join them,\\r\\nand lay together our own.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale are\\r\\nby far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales regularly hunted by man.\\r\\nTo the Nantucketer, they present the two extremes of all the known varieties of\\r\\nthe whale. As the external difference between them is mainly observable in\\r\\ntheir heads; and as a head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod\\'s\\r\\nside; and as we may freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across\\r\\nthe deck:\\xe2\\x80\\x94where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance to\\r\\nstudy practical cetology than here?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between these heads.\\r\\nBoth are massive enough in all conscience; but, there is a certain mathematical\\r\\nsymmetry in the Sperm Whale\\'s which the Right Whale\\'s sadly lacks. There is\\r\\nmore character in the Sperm Whale\\'s head. As you behold it, you involuntarily\\r\\nyield the immense superiority to him, in point of pervading dignity. In the\\r\\npresent instance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt color\\r\\nof his head at the summit, giving token of advanced age and large experience.\\r\\nIn short, he is what the fishermen technically call a \"grey-headed whale.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLet us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads\\xe2\\x80\\x94 namely, the two most\\r\\nimportant organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of the head, and\\r\\nlow down, near the angle of either whale\\'s jaw, if you narrowly search, you\\r\\nwill at last see a lashless eye, which you would fancy to be a young colt\\'s\\r\\neye; so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale\\'s eyes, it is plain that\\r\\nhe can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more than he can one\\r\\nexactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale\\'s eyes corresponds to that\\r\\nof a man\\'s ears; and you may fancy, for yourself, how it would fare with you,\\r\\ndid you sideways survey objects through your ears. You would find that you\\r\\ncould only command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight\\r\\nside-line of sight; and about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were\\r\\nwalking straight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not\\r\\nbe able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from behind. In\\r\\na word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the same time, also, two\\r\\nfronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes the front of a man\\xe2\\x80\\x94 what,\\r\\nindeed, but his eyes?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMoreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes are so\\r\\nplanted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to produce one\\r\\npicture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of the whale\\'s eyes,\\r\\neffectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head, which towers\\r\\nbetween them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys; this, of\\r\\ncourse, must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ\\r\\nimparts. The whale, therefore, must see one distinct picture on this side, and\\r\\nanother distinct picture on that side; while all between must be profound\\r\\ndarkness and nothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the\\r\\nworld from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. But with the\\r\\nwhale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two distinct windows,\\r\\nbut sadly impairing the view. This peculiarity of the whale\\'s eyes is a thing\\r\\nalways to be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be remembered by the reader\\r\\nin some subsequent scenes.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual\\r\\nmatter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a hint. So long as\\r\\na man\\'s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing is involuntary; that is,\\r\\nhe cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever objects are before him.\\r\\nNevertheless, any one\\'s experience will teach him, that though he can take in\\r\\nan undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance, it is quite impossible for\\r\\nhim, attentively, and completely, to examine any two things\\xe2\\x80\\x94however large or\\r\\nhowever small\\xe2\\x80\\x94 at one and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side\\r\\nby side and touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two\\r\\nobjects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in order to\\r\\nsee one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it, the\\r\\nother will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness. How is it,\\r\\nthen, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in themselves, must simultaneously\\r\\nact; but is his brain so much more comprehensive, combining, and subtle than\\r\\nman\\'s, that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct\\r\\nprospects, one on one side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite\\r\\ndirection? If he can, then is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were\\r\\nable simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems\\r\\nin Euclid. Nor, strictly investigated, is there any incongruity in this\\r\\ncomparison.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the\\r\\nextraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by\\r\\nthree or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer frights, so common to\\r\\nsuch whales; I think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless\\r\\nperplexity of volition, in which their divided and diametrically opposite\\r\\npowers of vision must involve them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an entire\\r\\nstranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads for hours, and\\r\\nnever discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf whatever; and into the\\r\\nhole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so wondrously minute is it. It is\\r\\nlodged a little behind the eye. With respect to their ears, this important\\r\\ndifference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right. While the\\r\\nears of the former has an external opening, that of the latter is entirely and\\r\\nevenly covered over with a membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from\\r\\nwithout.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIs it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the world\\r\\nthrough so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller\\r\\nthan a hare\\'s? But if his eyes were broad as the lens of Herschel\\'s great\\r\\ntelescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals; would that make\\r\\nhim any longer of sight, or sharper of hearing? Not at all.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Why then do you try\\r\\nto \"enlarge\" your mind? Subtilize it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLet us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant over\\r\\nthe sperm whale\\'s head, so, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending by a\\r\\nladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not that the body\\r\\nis now completely separated from it, with a lantern we might descend into the\\r\\ngreat Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But let us hold on here by this\\r\\ntooth, and look about us where we are. What a really beautiful and\\r\\nchaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling, lined, or rather papered with a\\r\\nglistening white membrane, glossy as bridal satins.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems like the\\r\\nlong narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at one end, instead of\\r\\none side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead, and expose its rows of\\r\\nteeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such, alas! it proves to many a poor\\r\\nwight in the fishery, upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force. But far\\r\\nmore terrible is it to behold, when fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky\\r\\nwhale, floating there suspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet\\r\\nlong, hanging straight down at right-angles with his body; for all the world\\r\\nlike a ship\\'s jibboom. This whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of\\r\\nsorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his jaw have\\r\\nrelaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a reproach to all\\r\\nhis tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn most cases this lower jaw\\xe2\\x80\\x94being easily unhinged by a practised artist\\xe2\\x80\\x94 is\\r\\ndisengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting the ivory teeth,\\r\\nand furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the fishermen\\r\\nfashion all sorts of curious articles including canes, umbrella-stocks, and\\r\\nhandles to riding-whips.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWith a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an anchor;\\r\\nand when the proper time comes\\xe2\\x80\\x94 some few days after the other work\\xe2\\x80\\x94Queequeg,\\r\\nDaggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished dentists, are set to drawing\\r\\nteeth. With a keen cutting-spade, Queequeg lances the gums; then the jaw is\\r\\nlashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle being rigged from aloft, they drag out\\r\\nthese teeth, as Michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild woodlands.\\r\\nThere are generally forty-two teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but\\r\\nundecayed; nor filled after our artificial fashion. The jaw is afterwards sawn\\r\\ninto slabs, and piled away like joists for building houses.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 75</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Right Whale\\'s Head - Contrasted View\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCrossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the the<br>\\r\\nRight Whale\\'s head.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs in general shape the noble Sperm Whale\\'s head may be compared to a Roman\\r\\nwar-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly rounded); so, at a\\r\\nbroad view, the Right Whale\\'s head bears a rather inelegant resemblance to a\\r\\ngigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred years ago an old Dutch voyager likened\\r\\nits shape to that of a shoemaker\\'s last. And in this same last or shoe, that\\r\\nold woman of the nursery tale with the swarming brood, might very comfortably\\r\\nbe lodged, she and all her progeny.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different\\r\\naspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit and look\\r\\nat these two f-shaped spout-holes, you would take the whole head for an\\r\\nenormous bass viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in its soundingboard.\\r\\nThen, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange, crested, comblike\\r\\nincrustation on the top of the mass\\xe2\\x80\\x94this green, barnacled thing, which the\\r\\nGreenlanders call the \"crown,\" and the Southern fishers the \"bonnet\" of the\\r\\nRight Whale; fixing your eyes solely on this, you would take the head for the\\r\\ntrunk of some huge oak, with a bird\\'s nest in its crotch. At any rate, when you\\r\\nwatch those live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet, such an idea will be\\r\\nalmost sure to occur to you; unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the\\r\\ntechnical term \"crown\" also bestowed upon it; in which case you will take great\\r\\ninterest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the\\r\\nsea, whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner.\\r\\nBut if this whale be a king, he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a\\r\\ndiadem. Look at that hanging lower lip! what a huge sulk and pout is there! a\\r\\nsulk and pout, by carpenter\\'s measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet\\r\\ndeep; a sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped. The\\r\\nfissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an important\\r\\ninterval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when earthquakes caused the beach\\r\\nto gape. Over this lip, as over a slippery threshold, we now slide into the\\r\\nmouth. Upon my word were I at Mackinaw, I should take this to be the inside of\\r\\nan Indian wigwam. Good Lord! is this the road that Jonah went? The roof is\\r\\nabout twelve feet high, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were a\\r\\nregular ridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy sides, present us\\r\\nwith those wondrous, half vertical, scimitar-shaped slats of whalebone, say\\r\\nthree hundred on a side, which depending from the upper part of the head or\\r\\ncrown bone, form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily\\r\\nmentioned. The edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres, through\\r\\nwhich the Right Whale strains the water, and in whose intricacies he retains\\r\\nthe small fish, when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding\\r\\ntime. In the central blinds of bone, as they stand in their natural order,\\r\\nthere are certain curious marks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some\\r\\nwhalemen calculate the creature\\'s age, as the age of an oak by its circular\\r\\nrings. Though the certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable, yet it\\r\\nhas the savor of analogical probability. At any rate, if we yield to it, we\\r\\nmust grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seem\\r\\nreasonable.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies concerning\\r\\nthese blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous \"whiskers\" inside\\r\\nof the whale\\'s mouth;* another, \"hogs\\' bristles\"; a third old gentleman in\\r\\nHackluyt uses the following elegant language: \"There are about two hundred and\\r\\nfifty fins growing on each side of his upper chop, which arch over his tongue\\r\\non each side of his mouth.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n*This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or rather a\\r\\nmoustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper part of the\\r\\nouter end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these tufts impart a rather brigandish\\r\\nexpression to his otherwise solemn countenance.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs every one knows, these same \"hogs\\' bristles,\" \"fins,\" \"whiskers,\" \"blinds,\"\\r\\nor whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and other stiffening\\r\\ncontrivances. But in this particular, the demand has long been on the decline.\\r\\nIt was in Queen Anne\\'s time that the bone was in its glory, the farthingale\\r\\nbeing then all the fashion. And as those ancient dames moved about gaily,\\r\\nthough in the jaws of the whale, as you may say; even so, in a shower, with the\\r\\nlike thoughtlessness, do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection;\\r\\nthe umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and, standing in the\\r\\nRight Whale\\'s mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all these colonnades of\\r\\nbone so methodically ranged about, would you not think you were inside of the\\r\\ngreat Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its thousand pipes? For a carpet to the\\r\\norgan we have a rug of the softest Turkey\\xe2\\x80\\x94the tongue, which is glued, as it\\r\\nwere, to the floor of the mouth. It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in\\r\\npieces in hoisting it on deck. This particular tongue now before us; at a\\r\\npassing glance I should say it was a six-barreler; that is, it will yield you\\r\\nabout that amount of oil.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEre this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started with\\xe2\\x80\\x94 that the\\r\\nSperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely different heads. To sum\\r\\nup, then: in the Right Whale\\'s there is no great well of sperm; no ivory teeth\\r\\nat all; no long, slender mandible of a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale\\'s. Nor\\r\\nin the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip;\\r\\nand scarcely anything of a tongue. Again, the Right Whale has two external\\r\\nspout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLook your last now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet lie\\r\\ntogether; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other will not be\\r\\nvery long in following.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCan you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale\\'s there? It is the same he died\\r\\nwith, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded away. I\\r\\nthink his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like placidity, born of a\\r\\nspeculative indifference as to death. But mark the other head\\'s expression. See\\r\\nthat amazing lower lip, pressed by accident against the vessel\\'s side, so as\\r\\nfirmly to embrace the jaw. Does not this whole head seem to speak of an\\r\\nenormous practical resolution in facing death? This Right Whale I take to have\\r\\nbeen a Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might have taken up Spinoza in\\r\\nhis latter years.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 76</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Battering-Ram\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEre quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale\\'s head, I would have you, as a\\r\\nsensible physiologist, simply\\xe2\\x80\\x94particularly remark its front aspect, in all its\\r\\ncompacted collectedness. I would have you investigate it now with the sole view\\r\\nof forming to yourself some unexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whatever\\r\\nbattering-ram power may be lodged there. Here is a vital point; for you must\\r\\neither satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself, or for ever remain an\\r\\ninfidel as to one of the most appalling, but not the less true events, perhaps\\r\\nanywhere to be found in all recorded history.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nYou observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale, the\\r\\nfront of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water; you\\r\\nobserve that the lower part of that front slopes considerably backwards, so as\\r\\nto furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boom-like\\r\\nlower jaw; you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head, much in the\\r\\nsame way, indeed, as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin.\\r\\nMoreover you observe that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he\\r\\nhas\\xe2\\x80\\x94his spout hole\\xe2\\x80\\x94 is on the top of his head; you observe that his eyes and\\r\\nears are at the sides of his head; nearly one third of his entire length from\\r\\nthe front. Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm\\r\\nWhale\\'s head is a dead, blind wall, without a single organ or tender prominence\\r\\nof any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are now to consider that only in the\\r\\nextreme, lower, backward sloping part of the front of the head, is there the\\r\\nslightest vestige of bone; and not till you get near twenty feet from the\\r\\nforehead do you come to the full cranial development. So that this whole\\r\\nenormous boneless mass is as one wad. Finally, though, as will soon be\\r\\nrevealed, its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you are now\\r\\nto be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all\\r\\nthat apparent effeminacy. In some previous place I have described to you how\\r\\nthe blubber wraps the body of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange. Just so\\r\\nwith the head; but with this difference: about the head this envelope, though\\r\\nnot so thick is of a boneless toughness, inestimable by any man who has not\\r\\nhandled it. The severest pointed harpoon, the sharpest lance darted by the\\r\\nstrongest human arm, impotently rebounds from it. It is as though the forehead\\r\\nof the Sperm Whale were paved with horses\\' hoofs. I do not think that any\\r\\nsensation lurks in it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indian-men\\r\\nchance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the sailors\\r\\ndo? They do not suspend between them, at the point of coming contact, any\\r\\nmerely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold there a large, round\\r\\nwad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox-hide. That\\r\\nbravely and uninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken\\r\\nhandspikes and iron crow-bars. By itself this sufficiently illustrates the\\r\\nobvious fact I drive at. But supplementary to this, it has hypothetically\\r\\noccurred to me, that as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder\\r\\nin them, capable, at will, of distension or contraction; and as the Sperm\\r\\nWhale, as far as I know, has no such provision in him; considering, too, the\\r\\notherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether\\r\\nbeneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated out of the water;\\r\\nconsidering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope; considering the unique\\r\\ninterior of his head; it has hypothetically occurred to me, I say, that those\\r\\nmystical lung-celled honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown\\r\\nand unsuspected connexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to\\r\\natmospheric distension and contraction. If this be so, fancy the\\r\\nirresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and destructive of\\r\\nall elements contributes.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, mark. Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable wall, and\\r\\nthis most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a mass of tremendous\\r\\nlife, only to be adequately estimated as piled wood is\\xe2\\x80\\x94 by the cord; and all\\r\\nobedient to one volition, as the smallest insect. So that when I shall\\r\\nhereafter detail to you all the specialities and concentrations of potency\\r\\neverywhere lurking in this expansive monster; when I shall show you some of his\\r\\nmore inconsiderable braining feats; I trust you will have renounced all\\r\\nignorant incredulity, and be ready to abide by this; that though the Sperm\\r\\nWhale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed the Atlantic\\r\\nwith the Pacific, you would not elevate one hair of your eye-brow. For unless\\r\\nyou own the whale, you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in Truth. But\\r\\nclear Truth is a thing for salamander giants only to encounter; how small the\\r\\nchances for the provincials then? What befell the weakling youth lifting the\\r\\ndread goddess\\'s veil at Lais?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 77</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Great Heidelburgh Tun\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow comes the Baling of the Case. But to comprehend it aright, you must know\\r\\nsomething of the curious internal structure of the thing operated upon.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nRegarding the Sperm Whale\\'s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an inclined\\r\\nplane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the lower is the bony\\r\\nstructure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an unctuous mass wholly\\r\\nfree from bones; its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent\\r\\nforehead of the whale. At the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide\\r\\nthis upper quoin, and then you have two almost equal parts, which before were\\r\\nnaturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n*Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical mathematics. I\\r\\nknow not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a solid which differs from\\r\\na wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side,\\r\\ninstead of the mutual tapering of both sides.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb of oil,\\r\\nformed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand infiltrated cells, of\\r\\ntough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent. The upper part, known\\r\\nas the Case, may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale.\\r\\nAnd as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front, so the whale\\'s\\r\\nvast plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical\\r\\nadornment of his wondrous tun. Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always\\r\\nreplenished with the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the\\r\\ntun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages;\\r\\nnamely, the highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid, and\\r\\nodoriferous state. Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other\\r\\npart of the creature. Though in life it remains perfectly fluid, yet, upon\\r\\nexposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to concrete; sending forth\\r\\nbeautiful crystalline shoots, as when the first thin delicate ice is just\\r\\nforming in water. A large whale\\'s case generally yields about five hundred\\r\\ngallons of sperm, though from unavoidable circumstances, considerable of it is\\r\\nspilled, leaks, and dribbles away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the\\r\\nticklish business of securing what you can.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was coated\\r\\nwithin, but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have\\r\\ncompared with the silken pearl-colored membrane, like the lining of a fine\\r\\npelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm Whale\\'s case.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale embraces the\\r\\nentire length of the entire top of the head; and since\\xe2\\x80\\x94as has been elsewhere\\r\\nset forth\\xe2\\x80\\x94the head embraces one third of the whole length of the creature, then\\r\\nsetting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale, you have more\\r\\nthan twenty-six feet for the depth of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up\\r\\nand down against a ship\\'s side.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs in decapitating the whale, the operator\\'s instrument is brought close to the\\r\\nspot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine; he\\r\\nhas, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest a careless, untimely stroke\\r\\nshould invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents. It\\r\\nis this decapitated end of the head, also, which is at last elevated out of the\\r\\nwater, and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles, whose\\r\\nhempen combinations, on one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in that\\r\\nquarter.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous and\\xe2\\x80\\x94 in this\\r\\nparticular instance\\xe2\\x80\\x94almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm Whale\\'s great\\r\\nHeidelburgh Tun is tapped.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 78</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCistern and Buckets\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect posture,\\r\\nruns straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm, to the part where it\\r\\nexactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried with him a light tackle\\r\\ncalled a whip, consisting of only two parts, travelling through a\\r\\nsingle-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that it hangs down from the\\r\\nyard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it is caught and firmly held by a\\r\\nhand on the deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down the other part, the Indian drops\\r\\nthrough the air, till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head.\\r\\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x94still high elevated above the rest of the company, to whom he vivaciously\\r\\ncries\\xe2\\x80\\x94 he seems some Turkish Muezzin calling the good people to prayers from\\r\\nthe top of a tower. A short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he\\r\\ndiligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In\\r\\nthis business he proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old\\r\\nhouse, sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time\\r\\nthis cautious search is over, a stout ironbound bucket, precisely like a\\r\\nwell-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the other end,\\r\\nbeing stretched across the deck, is there held by two or three alert hands.\\r\\nThese last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian, to whom another\\r\\nperson has reached up a very long pole. Inserting this pole into the bucket,\\r\\nTashtego downward guides the bucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears;\\r\\nthen giving the word to the seamen at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all\\r\\nbubbling like a dairy-maid\\'s pail of new milk. Carefully lowered from its\\r\\nheight, the full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand, and quickly\\r\\nemptied into a large tub. Then remounting aloft, it again goes through the same\\r\\nround until the deep cistern will yield no more. Towards the end, Tashtego has\\r\\nto ram his long pole harder and harder, and deeper and deeper into the Tun,\\r\\nuntil some twenty feet of the pole have gone down.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way; several\\r\\ntubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once a queer accident\\r\\nhappened. Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild Indian, was so heedless and\\r\\nreckless as to let go for a moment his one-handed hold on the great cabled\\r\\ntackles suspending the head; or whether the place where he stood was so\\r\\ntreacherous and oozy; or whether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out\\r\\nso, without stating his particular reasons; how it was exactly, there is no\\r\\ntelling now; but, on a sudden, as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came\\r\\nsuckingly up\\xe2\\x80\\x94my God! poor Tashtego\\xe2\\x80\\x94 like the twin reciprocating bucket in a\\r\\nveritable well, dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of Heidelburgh,\\r\\nand with a horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of sight!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Man overboard!\" cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation first came to\\r\\nhis senses. \"Swing the bucket this way!\" and putting one foot into it, so as\\r\\nthe better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip itself the hoisters ran\\r\\nhim high up to the top of the head, almost before Tashtego could have reached\\r\\nits interior bottom. Meantime, there was a terrible tumult. Looking over the\\r\\nside, they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the\\r\\nsurface of the sea, as if that moment seized with some momentous idea; whereas\\r\\nit was only the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the\\r\\nperilous depth to which he had sunk.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing the\\r\\nwhip\\xe2\\x80\\x94which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles\\xe2\\x80\\x94 a sharp cracking\\r\\nnoise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all, one of the two enormous\\r\\nhooks suspending the head tore out, and with a vast vibration the enormous mass\\r\\nsideways swung, till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an\\r\\niceberg. The one remaining hook, upon which the entire strain now depended,\\r\\nseemed every instant to be on the point of giving way; an event still more\\r\\nlikely from the violent motions of the head.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Come down, come down!\" yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one hand holding\\r\\non to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he would still remain\\r\\nsuspended; the negro having cleared the foul line, rammed down the bucket into\\r\\nthe now collapsed well, meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it, and\\r\\nso be hoisted out.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"In heaven\\'s name, man,\" cried Stubb, \"are you ramming home a cartridge\\r\\nthere?\\xe2\\x80\\x94Avast! How will that help him; jamming that iron-bound bucket on top of\\r\\nhis head? Avast, will ye!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Stand clear of the tackle!\" cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAlmost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass dropped into\\r\\nthe sea, like Niagara\\'s Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the suddenly relieved\\r\\nhull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering copper; and all caught\\r\\ntheir breath, as half swinging\\xe2\\x80\\x94now over the sailors\\' heads, and now over the\\r\\nwater\\xe2\\x80\\x94Daggoo, through a thick mist of spray, was dimly beheld clinging to the\\r\\npendulous tackles, while poor, buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down\\r\\nto the bottom of the sea! But hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away, when\\r\\na naked figure with a boardingsword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen\\r\\nhovering over the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my brave\\r\\nQueequeg had dived to the rescue. One packed rush was made to the side, and\\r\\nevery eye counted every ripple, as moment followed moment, and no sign of\\r\\neither the sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands now jumped into a boat\\r\\nalongside, and pushed a little off from the ship.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Ha! ha!\" cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging perch\\r\\noverhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust upright\\r\\nfrom the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust forth from the\\r\\ngrass over a grave.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Both! both!\\xe2\\x80\\x94it is both!\"-cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout; and soon\\r\\nafter, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand, and with the other\\r\\nclutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into the waiting boat, they were\\r\\nquickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was long in coming to, and Queequeg\\r\\ndid not look very brisk.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after the slowly\\r\\ndescending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges near its\\r\\nbottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then dropping his sword, had\\r\\nthrust his long arm far inwards and upwards, and so hauled out our poor Tash by\\r\\nthe head. He averred, that upon first thrusting in for him, a leg was\\r\\npresented; but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be, and might\\r\\noccasion great trouble;\\xe2\\x80\\x94he had thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave\\r\\nand toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next trial,\\r\\nhe came forth in the good old way\\xe2\\x80\\x94 head foremost. As for the great head itself,\\r\\nthat was doing as well as could be expected.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg, the\\r\\ndeliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was successfully accomplished, in\\r\\nthe teeth, too, of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediments; which\\r\\nis a lesson by no means to be forgotten. Midwifery should be taught in the same\\r\\ncourse with fencing and boxing, riding and rowing.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header\\'s will be sure to seem\\r\\nincredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have either seen or\\r\\nheard of some one\\'s falling into a cistern ashore; an accident which not seldom\\r\\nhappens, and with much less reason too than the Indian\\'s, considering the\\r\\nexceeding slipperiness of the curb of the Sperm Whale\\'s well.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought the\\r\\ntissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and most corky\\r\\npart about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater\\r\\nspecific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at all, but I have ye;\\r\\nfor at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had been nearly emptied of its\\r\\nlighter contents, leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well\\xe2\\x80\\x94a\\r\\ndouble welded, hammered substance, as I have before said, much heavier than the\\r\\nsea water, and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost. But the tendency\\r\\nto rapid sinking in this substance was in the present instance materially\\r\\ncounteracted by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it, so\\r\\nthat it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair\\r\\nchance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say. Yes, it\\r\\nwas a running delivery, so it was.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious perishing;\\r\\nsmothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant spermaceti; coffined,\\r\\nhearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the\\r\\nwhale. Only one sweeter end can readily be recalled\\xe2\\x80\\x94the delicious death of an\\r\\nOhio honey-hunter, who seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such\\r\\nexceeding store of it, that leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he\\r\\ndied embalmed. How many, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato\\'s honey\\r\\nhead, and sweetly perished there?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 79</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Prairie\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTo scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this Leviathan;\\r\\nthis is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has as yet undertaken.\\r\\nSuch an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for Lavater to have\\r\\nscrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar, or for Gall to have mounted\\r\\na ladder and manipulated the Dome of the Pantheon. Still, in that famous work\\r\\nof his, Lavater not only treats of the various faces of men, but also\\r\\nattentively studies the faces of horses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells\\r\\nin detail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein. Nor have\\r\\nGall and his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the\\r\\nphrenological characteristics of other beings than man. Therefore, though I am\\r\\nbut ill qualified for a pioneer, in the application of these two semi-sciences\\r\\nto the whale, I will do my endeavor. I try all things; I achieve what I can.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPhysiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He has no\\r\\nproper nose. And since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the\\r\\nfeatures; and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their\\r\\ncombined expression; hence it would seem that its entire absence, as an\\r\\nexternal appendage, must very largely affect the countenance of the whale. For\\r\\nas in landscape gardening, a spire, cupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is\\r\\ndeemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene; so no face can be\\r\\nphysiognomically in keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose.\\r\\nDash the nose from Phidias\\'s marble Jove, and what a sorry remainder!\\r\\nNevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all his proportions are so\\r\\nstately, that the same deficiency which in the sculptured Jove were hideous, in\\r\\nhim is no blemish at all. Nay, it is an added grandeur. A nose to the whale\\r\\nwould have been impertinent. As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round\\r\\nhis vast head in your jollyboat, your noble conceptions of him are never\\r\\ninsulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled. A pestilent\\r\\nconceit, which so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the\\r\\nmightiest royal beadle on his throne.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to be had of\\r\\nthe Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head. This aspect is sublime.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the morning.\\r\\nIn the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has a touch of the\\r\\ngrand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles, the elephant\\'s brow is\\r\\nmajestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is as that great golden seal\\r\\naffixed by the German Emperors to their decrees. It signifies\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"God: done this\\r\\nday by my hand.\" But in most creatures, nay in man himself, very often the brow\\r\\nis but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line. Few are the\\r\\nforeheads which like Shakespeare\\'s or Melancthon\\'s rise so high, and descend so\\r\\nlow, that the eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes; and\\r\\nall above them in the forehead\\'s wrinkles, you seem to track the antlered\\r\\nthoughts descending there to drink, as the Highland hunters track the snow\\r\\nprints of the deer. But in the great Sperm Whale, this high and mighty god-like\\r\\ndignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified, that gazing on it, in\\r\\nthat full front view, you feel the Deity and the dread powers more forcibly\\r\\nthan in beholding any other object in living nature. For you see no one point\\r\\nprecisely; not one distinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth;\\r\\nno face; he has none, proper; nothing but that one broad firmament of a\\r\\nforehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats, and\\r\\nships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish; though that\\r\\nway viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so. In profile, you plainly\\r\\nperceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic depression in the forehead\\'s middle,\\r\\nwhich, in a man, is Lavater\\'s mark of genius.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written a book,\\r\\nspoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in his doing nothing\\r\\nparticular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence. And\\r\\nthis reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale been known to the young Orient\\r\\nWorld, he would have been deified by their child-magian thoughts. They deified\\r\\nthe crocodile of the Nile, because the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm\\r\\nWhale has no tongue, or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable\\r\\nof protrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall lure\\r\\nback to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old; and livingly enthrone\\r\\nthem again in the now egotistical sky; in the now unhaunted hill; then be sure,\\r\\nexalted to Jove\\'s high seat, the great Sperm Whale shall lord it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nChampollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there is no\\r\\nChampollion to decipher the Egypt of every man\\'s and every being\\'s face.\\r\\nPhysiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing fable. If then,\\r\\nSir William Jones, who read in thirty languages, could not read the simplest\\r\\npeasant\\'s face in its profounder and more subtle meanings, how may unlettered\\r\\nIshmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale\\'s brow? I but put\\r\\nthat brow before you. Read if it if you can.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 80</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Nut\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIf the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist his brain\\r\\nseems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in\\r\\nlength. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as the side\\r\\nview of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base. But in\\r\\nlife\\xe2\\x80\\x94as we have elsewhere seen\\xe2\\x80\\x94this inclined plane is angularly filled up, and\\r\\nalmost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm. At\\r\\nthe high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass; while under\\r\\nthe long floor of this crater\\xe2\\x80\\x94in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in\\r\\nlength and as many in depth reposes the mere handful of this monster\\'s brain.\\r\\nThe brain is at least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is\\r\\nhidden away behind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the\\r\\namplified fortifications of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it secreted in\\r\\nhim, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the Sperm Whale\\r\\nhas any other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the\\r\\ncubic-yards of his sperm magazine. Lying in strange folds, courses, and\\r\\nconvolutions, to their apprehensions, it seems more in keeping with the idea of\\r\\nhis general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his\\r\\nintelligence.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in the\\r\\ncreature\\'s living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his true brain,\\r\\nyou can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The whale, like all things\\r\\nthat are mighty, wears a false brow to the common world.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIf you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its\\r\\nrear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its resemblance to the\\r\\nhuman skull, beheld in the same situation, and from the same point of view.\\r\\nIndeed, place this reversed skull (scaled down to the human magnitude) among a\\r\\nplate of men\\'s skulls, and you would involuntarily confound it with them; and\\r\\nremarking the depressions on one part of its summit, in phrenological phrase\\r\\nyou would say\\xe2\\x80\\x94This man had no self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those\\r\\nnegations, considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk\\r\\nand power, you can best form to yourself the truest, though not the most\\r\\nexhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut if from the comparative dimensions of the whale\\'s proper brain, you deem it\\r\\nincapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea for you. If you\\r\\nattentively regard almost any quadruped\\'s spine, you will be struck with the\\r\\nresemblance of its vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls, all\\r\\nbearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper. It is a German conceit,\\r\\nthat the vertebrae are absolutely undeveloped skulls. But the curious external\\r\\nresemblance, I take it the Germans were not the first men to perceive. A\\r\\nforeign friend once pointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had\\r\\nslain, and with the vertebrae of which he was inlaying, in a sort of\\r\\nbasso-relieve, the beaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the\\r\\nphrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their\\r\\ninvestigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal. For I believe that\\r\\nmuch of a man\\'s character will be found betokened in his backbone. I would\\r\\nrather feel your spine than your skull, whoever you are. A thin joist of a\\r\\nspine never yet upheld a full and noble soul. I rejoice in my spine, as in the\\r\\nfirm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the world.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nApply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial cavity\\r\\nis continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra the bottom of\\r\\nthe spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being eight in height, and of\\r\\na triangular figure with the base downwards. As it passes through the remaining\\r\\nvertebrae the canal tapers in size, but for a considerable distance remains of\\r\\nlarge capacity. Now, of course, this canal is filled with much the same\\r\\nstrangely fibrous substance\\xe2\\x80\\x94the spinal cord\\xe2\\x80\\x94as the brain; and directly\\r\\ncommunicates with the brain. And what is still more, for many feet after\\r\\nemerging from the brain\\'s cavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing\\r\\ngirth, almost equal to that of the brain. Under all these circumstances, would\\r\\nit be unreasonable to survey and map out the whale\\'s spine phrenologically?\\r\\nFor, viewed in this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain\\r\\nproper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his\\r\\nspinal cord.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I would\\r\\nmerely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the Sperm Whale\\'s\\r\\nhump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one of the larger\\r\\nvertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer convex mould of it. From\\r\\nits relative situation then, I should call this high hump the organ of firmness\\r\\nor indomitableness in the Sperm Whale. And that the great monster is\\r\\nindomitable, you will yet have reason to know.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 81</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Pequod Meets The Virgin\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship<br>\\r\\nJungfrau, Derick De Deer, master, of Bremen.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and Germans are\\r\\nnow among the least; but here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and\\r\\nlongitude, you still occasionally meet with their flag in the Pacific.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects. While yet\\r\\nsome distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a boat, her captain\\r\\nwas impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the bows instead of the stern.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What has he in his hand there?\" cried Starbuck, pointing to something wavingly\\r\\nheld by the German. \"Impossible!\\xe2\\x80\\x94a lamp-feeder!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Not that,\" said Stubb, \"no, no, it\\'s a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; he\\'s coming\\r\\noff to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don\\'t you see that big tin can there\\r\\nalongside of him?\\xe2\\x80\\x94that\\'s his boiling water.

There were\\r\\neight whales, an average pod. Aware of their danger, they were going all\\r\\nabreast with great speed straight before the wind, rubbing their flanks as\\r\\nclosely as so many spans of horses in harness. They left a great, wide wake, as\\r\\nthough continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFull in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge, humped old\\r\\nbull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as by the unusual\\r\\nyellowish incrustations over-growing him, seemed afflicted with the jaundice,\\r\\nor some other infirmity. Whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance,\\r\\nseemed questionable; for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to\\r\\nbe at all social. Nevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their\\r\\nback water must have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad\\r\\nmuzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet.\\r\\nHis spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming forth with a choking sort of\\r\\ngush, and spending itself in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean\\r\\ncommotions in him, which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity,\\r\\ncausing the waters behind him to upbubble.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Who\\'s got some paregoric?\" said Stubb, \"he has the stomach-ache,<br>\\r\\nI\\'m afraid. Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache!<br>\\r\\nAdverse winds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys.<br>\\r\\nIt\\'s the first foul wind I ever knew to blow from astern; but look,<br>\\r\\ndid ever whale yaw so before? it must be, he\\'s lost his tiller.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck load of\\r\\nfrightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her way; so did this\\r\\nold whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly turning over on his\\r\\ncumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump\\r\\nof his starboard fin. Whether he had lost that fin in battle, or had been born\\r\\nwithout it, it were hard to say.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Only wait a bit, old chap, and I\\'ll give ye a sling for that wounded arm,\"\\r\\ncried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Mind he don\\'t sling thee with it,\" cried Starbuck. \"Give way, or the German\\r\\nwill have him.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWith one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish,\\r\\nbecause not only was he the largest, and therefore the most valuable whale, but\\r\\nhe was nearest to them, and the other whales were going with such great\\r\\nvelocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit for the time. At this juncture,\\r\\nthe Pequod\\'s keels had shot by the three German boats last lowered; but from\\r\\nthe great start he had had, Derick\\'s boat still led the chase, though every\\r\\nmoment neared by his foreign rivals. The only thing they feared, was, that from\\r\\nbeing already so nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron before\\r\\nthey could completely overtake and pass him. As for Derick, he seemed quite\\r\\nconfident that this would be the case, and occasionally with a deriding gesture\\r\\nshook his lamp-feeder at the other boats.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"The ungracious and ungrateful dog!\" cried Starbuck; \"he mocks and dares me\\r\\nwith the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes ago!\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Then in his old\\r\\nintense whisper\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"give way, greyhounds!

In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of the headsman when drawing near\\r\\nto his prey, the three mates stood up proudly, occasionally backing the after\\r\\noarsman with an exhilarating cry of, \"There she slides, now! Hurrah for the\\r\\nwhite-ash breeze! Down with the Yarman! Sail over him!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all their\\r\\ngallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not a righteous\\r\\njudgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship\\r\\noarsman. While this clumsy lubber was striving to free his white-ash, and\\r\\nwhile, in consequence, Derick\\'s boat was nigh to capsizing, and he thundering\\r\\naway at his men in a mighty rage;\\xe2\\x80\\x94that was a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and\\r\\nFlask. With a shout, they took a mortal start forwards, and slantingly ranged\\r\\nup on the German\\'s quarter. An instant more, and all four boats were\\r\\ndiagonically in the whale\\'s immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both\\r\\nsides, was the foaming swell that he made.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was now going\\r\\nhead out, and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet; while\\r\\nhis one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright. Now to this hand, now to\\r\\nthat, he yawed in his faltering flight, and still at every billow that he\\r\\nbroke, he spasmodically sank in the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his\\r\\none beating fin. So have I seen a bird with clipped wing, making affrighted\\r\\nbroken circles in the air, vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks. But\\r\\nthe bird has a voice, and with plaintive cries will make known her fear; but\\r\\nthe fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted in\\r\\nhim; he had no voice, save that choking respiration through his spiracle, and\\r\\nthis made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his amazing\\r\\nbulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to appal the\\r\\nstoutest man who so pitied.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSeeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod\\'s boats the\\r\\nadvantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, Derick chose to hazard\\r\\nwhat to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart, ere the last chance\\r\\nwould for ever escape.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all three\\r\\ntigers\\xe2\\x80\\x94Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo\\xe2\\x80\\x94instinctively sprang to their feet, and\\r\\nstanding in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their barbs; and darted over\\r\\nthe head of the German harpooneer, their three Nantucket irons entered the\\r\\nwhale. Blinding vapors of foam and white-fire! The three boats, in the first\\r\\nfury of the whale\\'s headlong rush, bumped the German\\'s aside with such force,\\r\\nthat both Derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over\\r\\nby the three flying keels.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be afraid, my butter-boxes,\" cried Stubb, casting a passing glance upon\\r\\nthem as he shot by; \"ye\\'ll be picked up presently\\xe2\\x80\\x94 all right\\xe2\\x80\\x94I saw some sharks\\r\\nastern\\xe2\\x80\\x94St. Bernard\\'s dogs, you know\\xe2\\x80\\x94 relieve distressed travellers. Hurrah!\\r\\nthis is the way to sail now. Every keel a sunbeam! Hurrah!\\xe2\\x80\\x94Here we go like\\r\\nthree tin kettles at the tail of a mad cougar! This puts me in mind of\\r\\nfastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain\\xe2\\x80\\x94 makes the wheelspokes fly,\\r\\nboys, when you fasten to him that way; and there\\'s danger of being pitched out\\r\\ntoo, when you strike a hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when he\\'s\\r\\ngoing to Davy Jones\\xe2\\x80\\x94all a rush down an endless inclined plane! Hurrah! this\\r\\nwhale carries the everlasting mail!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut the monster\\'s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he tumultuously\\r\\nsounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round the loggerheads with\\r\\nsuch a force as to gouge deep grooves in them; while so fearful were the\\r\\nharpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the lines, that using\\r\\nall their dexterous might, they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to\\r\\nhold on; till at last\\xe2\\x80\\x94owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined\\r\\nchocks of the boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the\\r\\nblue\\xe2\\x80\\x94the gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while the three\\r\\nsterns tilted high in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound, for some\\r\\ntime they remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more line, though the\\r\\nposition was a little ticklish. But though boats have been taken down and lost\\r\\nin this way, yet it is this \"holding on,\" as it is called; this hooking up by\\r\\nthe sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back; this it is that often torments\\r\\nthe Leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes. Yet\\r\\nnot to speak of the peril of the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course\\r\\nis always the best; for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the\\r\\nstricken whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted. Because, owing to\\r\\nthe enormous surface of him\\xe2\\x80\\x94 in a full grown sperm whale something less than\\r\\n2000 square feet\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the pressure of the water is immense. We all know what an\\r\\nastonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even here,\\r\\nabove-ground, in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a whale, bearing on his\\r\\nback a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean! It must at least equal the\\r\\nweight of fifty atmospheres. One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of\\r\\ntwenty line-of-battle ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men on board.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down into its\\r\\neternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any sort, nay, not so\\r\\nmuch as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths; what landsman would have\\r\\nthought, that beneath all that silence and placidity, the utmost monster of the\\r\\nseas was writhing and wrenching in agony! Not eight inches of perpendicular\\r\\nrope were visible at the bows. Seems it credible that by three such thin\\r\\nthreads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day\\r\\nclock. Suspended? and to what? To three bits of board. Is this the creature of\\r\\nwhom it was once so triumphantly said\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Canst thou fill his skin with barbed\\r\\nirons? or his head with fish-spears? The sword of him that layeth at him cannot\\r\\nhold, the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron as straw; the\\r\\narrow cannot make him flee; darts are counted as stubble; he laugheth at the\\r\\nshaking of a spear!\" This the creature? this he? Oh! that unfulfilments should\\r\\nfollow the prophets. For with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail,\\r\\nLeviathan had run his head under the mountains of the sea, to hide him from the\\r\\nPequod\\'s fishspears!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats sent down\\r\\nbeneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half\\r\\nXerxes\\' army. Who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been\\r\\nsuch huge phantoms flitting over his head!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Stand by, men; he stirs,\" cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly vibrated\\r\\nin the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by magnetic wires, the\\r\\nlife and death throbs of the whale, so that every oarsman felt them in his\\r\\nseat. The next moment, relieved in a great part from the downward strain at the\\r\\nbows, the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards, as a small icefield will, when a\\r\\ndense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Haul in! Haul in!\" cried Starbuck again; \"he\\'s rising.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand\\'s breadth could\\r\\nhave been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all dripping into the\\r\\nboats, and soon the whale broke water within two ship\\'s length of the hunters.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHis motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land animals there\\r\\nare certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins, whereby when wounded,\\r\\nthe blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions.\\r\\nNot so with the whale; one of whose peculiarities it is, to have an entire\\r\\nnon-valvular structure of the blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so\\r\\nsmall a point as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole\\r\\narterial system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of\\r\\nwater at a great distance below the surface, his life may be said to pour from\\r\\nhim in incessant streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him, and so\\r\\ndistant and numerous its interior fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding\\r\\nand bleeding for a considerable period; even as in a drought a river will flow,\\r\\nwhose source is in the well-springs of far-off and indiscernible hills. Even\\r\\nnow, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew over his\\r\\nswaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him, they were followed by\\r\\nsteady jets from the new made wound, which kept continually playing, while the\\r\\nnatural spout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending\\r\\nits affrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood yet came,\\r\\nbecause no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life, as they\\r\\nsignificantly call it, was untouched.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of his form,\\r\\nwith much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly revealed. His eyes,\\r\\nor rather the places where his eyes had been, were beheld. As strange misgrown\\r\\nmasses gather in the knot-holes of the noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the\\r\\npoints which the whale\\'s eyes had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs,\\r\\nhorribly pitiable to see. But pity there was none. For all his old age, and his\\r\\none arm, and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to\\r\\nlight the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate\\r\\nthe solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all.\\r\\nStill rolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a strangely\\r\\ndiscolored bunch or protuberance, the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"A nice spot,\" cried Flask; \"just let me prick him there once.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Avast!\" cried Starbuck, \"there\\'s no need of that!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet\\r\\nshot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish,\\r\\nthe whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury blindly darted at the\\r\\ncraft, bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of\\r\\ngore, capsizing Flask\\'s boat and marring the bows. It was his death stroke.\\r\\nFor, by this time, so spent was he by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled\\r\\naway from the wreck he had made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped\\r\\nwith his stumped fin, then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world;\\r\\nturned up the white secrets of his belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most\\r\\npiteous, that last expiring spout. As when by unseen hands the water is\\r\\ngradually drawn off from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled melancholy\\r\\ngurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the ground\\xe2\\x80\\x94 so the last long\\r\\ndying spout of the whale.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSoon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body showed\\r\\nsymptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled. Immediately, by Starbuck\\'s\\r\\norders, lines were secured to it at different points, so that ere long every\\r\\nboat was a buoy; the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by\\r\\nthe cords. By very heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was\\r\\ntransferred to her side, and was strongly secured there by the stiffest\\r\\nfluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially upheld, the body would\\r\\nat once sink to the bottom.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade, the\\r\\nentire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh, on the\\r\\nlower part of the bunch before described. But as the stumps of harpoons are\\r\\nfrequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales, with the flesh\\r\\nperfectly healed around them, and no prominence of any kind to denote their\\r\\nplace; therefore, there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the\\r\\npresent case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to. But still more\\r\\ncurious was the fact of a lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from\\r\\nthe buried iron, the flesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that stone\\r\\nlance? And when? It might have been darted by some Nor\\' West Indian long before\\r\\nAmerica was discovered.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhat other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there\\r\\nis no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further discoveries, by the ship\\'s\\r\\nbeing unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea, owing to the body\\'s\\r\\nimmensely increasing tendency to sink. However, Starbuck, who had the ordering\\r\\nof affairs, hung on to it to the last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed,\\r\\nthat when at length the ship would have been capsized, if still persisting in\\r\\nlocking arms with the body; then, when the command was given to break clear\\r\\nfrom it, such was the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the\\r\\nfluke-chains and cables were fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off.\\r\\nMeantime everything in the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the other side of the\\r\\ndeck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house. The ship groaned and\\r\\ngasped. Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started\\r\\nfrom their places, by the unnatural dislocation. In vain handspikes and crows\\r\\nwere brought to bear upon the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from\\r\\nthe timberheads; and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends\\r\\ncould not be at all approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity\\r\\nseemed added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going\\r\\nover.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Hold on, hold on, won\\'t ye?\" cried Stubb to the body, \"don\\'t be in such a\\r\\ndevil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something or go for it.\\r\\nNo use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes, and run one of ye for a\\r\\nprayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big chains.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Knife? Aye, aye,\" cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter\\'s heavy hatchet,\\r\\nhe leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing at the largest\\r\\nfluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were given, when the exceeding\\r\\nstrain effected the rest. With a terrific snap, every fastening went adrift;\\r\\nthe ship righted, the carcase sank.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale is a\\r\\nvery curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it.\\r\\nUsually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy, with its side or belly\\r\\nconsiderably elevated above the surface. If the only whales that thus sank were\\r\\nold, meagre, and broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and\\r\\nall their bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert\\r\\nthat this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so\\r\\nsinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. But it is not\\r\\nso. For young whales, in the highest health, and swelling with noble\\r\\naspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of life, with all\\r\\ntheir panting lard about them! even these brawny, buoyant heroes do sometimes\\r\\nsink.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBe it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this accident\\r\\nthan any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty Right Whales do.\\r\\nThis difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the\\r\\ngreater quantity of bone in the Right Whale; his Venetian blinds alone\\r\\nsometimes weighing more than a ton; from this incumbrance the Sperm Whale is\\r\\nwholly free. But there are instances where, after the lapse of many hours or\\r\\nseveral days, the sunken whale again rises, more buoyant than in life. But the\\r\\nreason of this is obvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to a\\r\\nprodigious magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship\\r\\ncould hardly keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings, among the\\r\\nBays of New Zealand, when a Right Whale gives token of sinking, they fasten\\r\\nbuoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when the body has gone down, they\\r\\nknow where to look for it when it shall have ascended again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the\\r\\nPequod\\'s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering her boats;\\r\\nthough the only spout in sight was that of a Fin-Back, belonging to the species\\r\\nof uncapturable whales, because of its incredible power of swimming.\\r\\nNevertheless, the Fin-Back\\'s spout is so similar to the Sperm Whale\\'s, that by\\r\\nunskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it. And consequently Derick and\\r\\nall his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute. The Virgin\\r\\ncrowding all sail, made after her four young keels, and thus they all\\r\\ndisappeared far to leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 82</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Honor and Glory of Whaling\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true\\r\\nmethod.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up to the\\r\\nvery spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with its great\\r\\nhonorableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so many great demi-gods\\r\\nand heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other have shed distinction\\r\\nupon it, I am transported with the reflection that I myself belong, though but\\r\\nsubordinately, to so emblazoned a fraternity.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to the\\r\\neternal honor of our calling be it said, that the first whale attacked by our\\r\\nbrotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent. Those were the knightly days\\r\\nof our profession, when we only bore arms to succor the distressed, and not to\\r\\nfill men\\'s lamp-feeders. Every one knows the fine story of Perseus and\\r\\nAndromeda; how the lovely Andromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock\\r\\non the sea-coast, and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off,\\r\\nPerseus, the prince of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster,\\r\\nand delivered and married the maid. It was an admirable artistic exploit,\\r\\nrarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day; inasmuch as this\\r\\nLeviathan was slain at the very first dart. And let no man doubt this Arkite\\r\\nstory; for in the ancient Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast, in one of the\\r\\nPagan temples, there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale, which\\r\\nthe city\\'s legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones\\r\\nof the monster that Perseus slew. When the Romans took Joppa, the same skeleton\\r\\nwas carried to Italy in triumph. What seems most singular and suggestively\\r\\nimportant in this story, is this: it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAkin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda\\xe2\\x80\\x94indeed, by some supposed to be\\r\\nindirectly derived from it\\xe2\\x80\\x94is that famous story of St. George and the Dragon;\\r\\nwhich dragon I maintain to have been a whale; for in many old chronicles whales\\r\\nand dragons are strangely jumbled together, and often stand for each other.\\r\\n\"Thou art as a lion of the waters, and as a dragon of the sea,\" said Ezekiel;\\r\\nhereby, plainly meaning a whale; in truth, some versions of the Bible use that\\r\\nword itself. Besides, it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had\\r\\nSt. George but encountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of doing\\r\\nbattle with the great monster of the deep. Any man may kill a snake, but only a\\r\\nPerseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to march boldly up to a\\r\\nwhale.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLet not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the creature\\r\\nencountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely represented of a\\r\\ngriffin-like shape, and though the battle is depicted on land and the saint on\\r\\nhorseback, yet considering the great ignorance of those times, when the true\\r\\nform of the whale was unknown to artists; and considering that as in Perseus\\'\\r\\ncase, St. George\\'s whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach; and\\r\\nconsidering that the animal ridden by St. George might have been only a large\\r\\nseal, or sea-horse; bearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether\\r\\nincompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene,\\r\\nto hold this so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself. In\\r\\nfact, placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story will fare\\r\\nlike that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines, Dagon by name; who\\r\\nbeing planted before the ark of Israel, his horse\\'s head and both the palms of\\r\\nhis hands fell off from him, and only the stump or fishy part of him remained.\\r\\nThus, then, one of our own noble stamp, even a whaleman, is the tutelary\\r\\nguardian of England; and by good rights, we harpooneers of Nantucket should be\\r\\nenrolled in the most noble order of St. George. And therefore, let not the\\r\\nknights of that honorable company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever\\r\\nhad to do with a whale like their great patron), let them never eye a\\r\\nNantucketer with disdain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers\\r\\nwe are much better entitled to St. George\\'s decoration than they.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long remained\\r\\ndubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that antique Crockett\\r\\nand Kit Carson\\xe2\\x80\\x94that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds, was swallowed down and\\r\\nthrown up by a whale; still, whether that strictly makes a whaleman of him,\\r\\nthat might be mooted. It nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his\\r\\nfish, unless, indeed, from the inside. Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of\\r\\ninvoluntary whaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not the\\r\\nwhale. I claim him for one of our clan.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of Hercules and\\r\\nthe whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient Hebrew story\\r\\nof Jonah and the whale; and vice versa; certainly they are very similar. If I\\r\\nclaim the demigod then, why not the prophet?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of\\r\\nour order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like royal kings of old\\r\\ntimes, we find the head-waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great\\r\\ngods themselves. That wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the\\r\\nShaster, which gives us the dread Vishnoo, one of the three persons in the\\r\\ngodhead of the Hindoos; gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for our\\r\\nLord;\\xe2\\x80\\x94Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten earthly incarnations, has for ever\\r\\nset apart and sanctified the whale. When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith the\\r\\nShaster, resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical\\r\\ndissolutions, he gave birth to Vishnoo, to preside over the work; but the\\r\\nVedas, or mystical books, whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable\\r\\nto Vishnoo before beginning the creation, and which therefore must have\\r\\ncontained something in the shape of practical hints to young architects, these\\r\\nVedas were lying at the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became incarnate in a\\r\\nwhale, and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths, rescued the sacred\\r\\nvolumes. Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman, then? even as a man who rides a horse\\r\\nis called a horseman?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPerseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there\\'s a member-roll for\\r\\nyou!

Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical story\\r\\nof Jonah and the whale. But then there were some sceptical Greeks and Romans,\\r\\nwho, standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times, equally doubted the\\r\\nstory of Hercules and the whale, and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their\\r\\ndoubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less\\r\\nfacts, for all that.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOne old Sag-Harbor whaleman\\'s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew story was\\r\\nthis:\\xe2\\x80\\x94He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles, embellished with\\r\\ncurious, unscientific plates; one of which represented Jonah\\'s whale with two\\r\\nspouts in his head\\xe2\\x80\\x94a peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the\\r\\nLeviathan (the Right Whale, and the varieties of that order), concerning which\\r\\nthe fishermen have this saying, \"A penny roll would choke him\"; his swallow is\\r\\nso very small. But, to this, Bishop Jebb\\'s anticipative answer is ready. It is\\r\\nnot necessary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the\\r\\nwhale\\'s belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And this\\r\\nseems reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the Right Whale\\'s mouth\\r\\nwould accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the\\r\\nplayers. Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth;\\r\\nbut, on second thoughts, the Right Whale is toothless.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnother reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his want of\\r\\nfaith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in reference to\\r\\nhis incarcerated body and the whale\\'s gastric juices. But this objection\\r\\nlikewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist supposes that Jonah\\r\\nmust have taken refuge in the floating body of a dead whale\\xe2\\x80\\x94 even as the French\\r\\nsoldiers in the Russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents, and\\r\\ncrawled into them. Besides, it has been divined by other continental\\r\\ncommentators, that when Jonah was thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he\\r\\nstraightway effected his escape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a\\r\\nwhale for a figure-head; and, I would add, possibly called \"The Whale,\" as some\\r\\ncraft are nowadays christened the \"Shark,\" the \"Gull,\" the \"Eagle.\" Nor have\\r\\nthere been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned\\r\\nin the book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver\\xe2\\x80\\x94an inflated bag of\\r\\nwind\\xe2\\x80\\x94which the endangered prophet swam to, and so was saved from a watery doom.\\r\\nPoor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round. But he had still another\\r\\nreason for his want of faith. It was this, if I remember right: Jonah was\\r\\nswallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea, and after three days\\' he was\\r\\nvomited up somewhere within three days\\' journey of Nineveh, a city on the\\r\\nTigris, very much more than three days\\' journey across from the nearest point\\r\\nof the Mediterranean coast. How is that?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short\\r\\ndistance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by the way of the\\r\\nCape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage through the whole length of\\r\\nthe Mediterranean, and another passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a\\r\\nsupposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three\\r\\ndays, not to speak of the Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too\\r\\nshallow for any whale to swim in. Besides, this idea of Jonah\\'s weathering the\\r\\nCape of Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of\\r\\nthat great headland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and so make\\r\\nmodern history a liar.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his foolish\\r\\npride of reason\\xe2\\x80\\x94a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing that he had but\\r\\nlittle learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea. I say it\\r\\nonly shows his foolish, impious pride, and abominable, devilish rebellion\\r\\nagainst the reverend clergy. For by a Portuguese Catholic priest, this very\\r\\nidea of Jonah\\'s going to Nineveh via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a\\r\\nsignal magnification of the general miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this\\r\\nday, the highly enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of\\r\\nJonah. And some three centuries ago, an English traveller in old Harris\\'s\\r\\nVoyages, speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in honor of Jonah, in which Mosque\\r\\nwas a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 84</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPitchpoling\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTo make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are anointed; and\\r\\nfor much the same purpose, some whalers perform an analogous operation upon\\r\\ntheir boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it to be doubted that as such a\\r\\nprocedure can do no harm, it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage;\\r\\nconsidering that oil and water are hostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and\\r\\nthat the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely. Queequeg believed\\r\\nstrongly in anointing his boat, and one morning not long after the German ship\\r\\nJungfrau disappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation;\\r\\ncrawling under its bottom, where it hung over the side, and rubbing in the\\r\\nunctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the\\r\\ncraft\\'s bald keel. He seemed to be working in obedience to some particular\\r\\npresentiment. Nor did it remain unwarranted by the event.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTowards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down to them,\\r\\nthey turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered flight, as of\\r\\nCleopatra\\'s barges from Actium.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb\\'s was foremost. By great exertion,\\r\\nTashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the stricken whale,\\r\\nwithout at all sounding, still continued his horizontal flight, with added\\r\\nfleetness. Such unintermitted strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or\\r\\nlater inevitably extract it. It became imperative to lance the flying whale, or\\r\\nbe content to lose him. But to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he\\r\\nswam so fast and furious. What then remained?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and countless\\r\\nsubtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced, none exceed that\\r\\nfine manoeuvre with the lance called pitchpoling. Small sword, or broad sword,\\r\\nin all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It is only indispensable with an\\r\\ninveterate running whale; its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance\\r\\nto which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking\\r\\nboat, under extreme headway. Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some\\r\\nten or twelve feet in length; the staff is much slighter than that of the\\r\\nharpoon, and also of a lighter material\\xe2\\x80\\x94pine. It is furnished with a small rope\\r\\ncalled a warp, of considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to the\\r\\nhand after darting.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut before going further, it is important to mention here, that though the\\r\\nharpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it is seldom\\r\\ndone; and when done, is still less frequently successful, on account of the\\r\\ngreater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance,\\r\\nwhich in effect become serious drawbacks. As a general thing, therefore, you\\r\\nmust first get fast to a whale, before any pitchpoling comes into play.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLook now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and\\r\\nequanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel in\\r\\npitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying\\r\\nboat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet ahead. Handling the\\r\\nlong lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be\\r\\nexactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one\\r\\nhand, so as to secure its free end in his grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed.\\r\\nThen holding the lance full before his waistband\\'s middle, he levels it at the\\r\\nwhale; when, covering him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his\\r\\nhand, thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon\\r\\nhis palm, fifteen feet in the air. He minds you somewhat of a juggler,\\r\\nbalancing a long staff on his chin. Next moment with a rapid, nameless impulse,\\r\\nin a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance, and quivers\\r\\nin the life spot of the whale. Instead of sparkling water, he now spouts red\\r\\nblood.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"That drove the spigot out of him!\" cried Stubb. \"\\'Tis July\\'s immortal Fourth;\\r\\nall fountains must run wine today!

Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills, the\\r\\nfinny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the\\r\\nelement in which they swim; hence, a herring or a cod might live a century, and\\r\\nnever once raise its head above the surface. But owing to his marked internal\\r\\nstructure which gives him regular lungs, like a human being\\'s, the whale can\\r\\nonly live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the\\r\\nnecessity for his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot in any\\r\\ndegree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm\\r\\nWhale\\'s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface; and what is\\r\\nstill more, his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth. No, he breathes\\r\\nthrough his spiracle alone; and this is on the top of his head.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIf I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to\\r\\nvitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element, which being\\r\\nsubsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its\\r\\nvivifying principle, I do not think I shall err; though I may possibly use some\\r\\nsuperfluous scientific words. Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood\\r\\nin a man could be aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils\\r\\nand not fetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then\\r\\nlive without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the case\\r\\nwith the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full hour and more\\r\\n(when at the bottom) without drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way\\r\\ninhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has no gills. How is this?\\r\\nBetween his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable\\r\\ninvolved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he\\r\\nquits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated blood. So that for\\r\\nan hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of\\r\\nvitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a\\r\\nsurplus supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs. The\\r\\nanatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the supposition\\r\\nfounded upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I\\r\\nconsider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his\\r\\nspoutings out, as the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested,\\r\\nupon rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of\\r\\ntime exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven\\r\\nminutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then\\r\\nwhenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over\\r\\nagain, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him, so\\r\\nthat he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular\\r\\nallowance of air. And not till those seventy breaths are told, will he finally\\r\\ngo down to stay out his full term below. Remark, however, that in different\\r\\nindividuals these rates are different; but in any one they are alike. Now, why\\r\\nshould the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to\\r\\nreplenish his reservoir of air, ere descending for good? How obvious it is it,\\r\\ntoo, that this necessity for the whale\\'s rising exposes him to all the fatal\\r\\nhazards of the chase. For not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be\\r\\ncaught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not so much thy\\r\\nskill, then, O hunter, as the great necessities that strike the victory to\\r\\nthee!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn man, breathing is incessantly going on\\xe2\\x80\\x94one breath only serving for two or\\r\\nthree pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to attend to, waking\\r\\nor sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the Sperm Whale only breathes\\r\\nabout one seventh or Sunday of his time.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole; if it\\r\\ncould truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water, then I opine we\\r\\nshould be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in\\r\\nhim; for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that\\r\\nidentical spout-hole; and being so clogged with two elements, it could not be\\r\\nexpected to have the power of smelling. But owing to the mystery of the\\r\\nspout\\xe2\\x80\\x94whether it be water or whether it be vapor\\xe2\\x80\\x94no absolute certainty can as\\r\\nyet be arrived at on this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale\\r\\nhas no proper olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no violets,\\r\\nno Cologne-water in the sea.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFurthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal,\\r\\nand as that long canal\\xe2\\x80\\x94like the grand Erie Canal\\xe2\\x80\\x94 is furnished with a sort of\\r\\nlocks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of air or the upward\\r\\nexclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice; unless you insult him by\\r\\nsaying, that when he so strangely rumbles, he talks through his nose. But then\\r\\nagain, what has the whale to say? Seldom have I known any profound being that\\r\\nhad anything to say to this world, unless forced to stammer out something by\\r\\nway of getting a living. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent\\r\\nlistener!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is for the\\r\\nconveyance of air, and for several feet laid along, horizontally, just beneath\\r\\nthe upper surface of his head, and a little to one side; this curious canal is\\r\\nvery much like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street. But the\\r\\nquestion returns whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words,\\r\\nwhether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath,\\r\\nor whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and\\r\\ndischarged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth indirectly\\r\\ncommunicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be proved that this is for\\r\\nthe purpose of discharging water through the spiracle. Because the greatest\\r\\nnecessity for so doing would seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes\\r\\nin water. But the Sperm Whale\\'s food is far beneath the surface, and there he\\r\\ncannot spout even if he would. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and\\r\\ntime him with your watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an\\r\\nundeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of\\r\\nrespiration.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out! You have\\r\\nseen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not tell water from\\r\\nair? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things.\\r\\nI have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all. And as for this whale\\r\\nspout, you might almost stand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is\\r\\nprecisely.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it; and\\r\\nhow can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it, when, always, when\\r\\nyou are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout, he is in a\\r\\nprodigious commotion, the water cascading all around him. And if at such times\\r\\nyou should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how\\r\\ndo you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you\\r\\nknow that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the\\r\\nspout-hole fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale\\'s head?\\r\\nFor even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with his\\r\\nelevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary\\'s in the desert; even then, the whale\\r\\nalways carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a blazing sun you\\r\\nwill sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise\\r\\nnature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering into it, and\\r\\nputting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to this fountain and\\r\\nfill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into slight contact with the\\r\\nouter, vapory shreds of the jet, which will often happen, your skin will\\r\\nfeverishly smart, from the acridness of the thing so touching it. And I know\\r\\none, who coming into still closer contact with the spout, whether with some\\r\\nscientific object in view, or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from\\r\\nhis cheek and arm. Wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous;\\r\\nthey try to evade it. Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much\\r\\ndoubt it, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you.\\r\\nThe wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let this\\r\\ndeadly spout alone.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nStill, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My hypothesis\\r\\nis this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides other reasons, to this\\r\\nconclusion I am impelled, by considerations touching the great inherent dignity\\r\\nand sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I account him no common, shallow being,\\r\\ninasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings, or\\r\\nnear shores; all other whales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound.\\r\\nAnd I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such\\r\\nas Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes up a\\r\\ncertain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep thoughts. While\\r\\ncomposing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the curiosity to place a mirror\\r\\nbefore me; and ere long saw reflected there, a curious involved worming and\\r\\nundulation in the atmosphere over my head. The invariable moisture of my hair,\\r\\nwhile plunged in deep thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled\\r\\nattic, of an August noon; this seems an additional argument for the above\\r\\nsupposition.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to behold him\\r\\nsolemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild head overhung by a\\r\\ncanopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable contemplations, and that\\r\\nvapor\\xe2\\x80\\x94 as you will sometimes see it\\xe2\\x80\\x94glorified by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself\\r\\nhad put its seal upon his thoughts. For d\\'ye see, rainbows do not visit the\\r\\nclear air; they only irradiate vapor. And so, through all the thick mists of\\r\\nthe dim doubts in my mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my\\r\\nfog with a heavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many\\r\\ndeny; but doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts of\\r\\nall things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this combination\\r\\nmakes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who regards them both with\\r\\nequal eye.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 86</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Tail\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOther poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope, and the\\r\\nlovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial, I celebrate a\\r\\ntail.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nReckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale\\'s tail to begin at that point of the\\r\\ntrunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises upon its upper\\r\\nsurface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet.

At the crotch or junction, these flukes\\r\\nslightly overlap, then sideways recede from each other like wings, leaving a\\r\\nwide vacancy between. In no living thing are the lines of beauty more\\r\\nexquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes. At its\\r\\nutmost expansion in the full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed\\r\\ntwenty feet across.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut into it,\\r\\nand you find that three distinct strata compose it:\\xe2\\x80\\x94upper, middle, and lower.\\r\\nThe fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long and horizontal; those of the\\r\\nmiddle one, very short, and running crosswise between the outside layers. This\\r\\ntriune structure, as much as anything else, imparts power to the tail. To the\\r\\nstudent of old Roman walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to\\r\\nthe thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful\\r\\nrelics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great\\r\\nstrength of the masonry.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough, the\\r\\nwhole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular\\r\\nfibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins and running down\\r\\ninto the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and largely contribute to their\\r\\nmight; so that in the tail the confluent measureless force of the whole whale\\r\\nseems concentrated to a point. Could annihilation occur to matter, this were\\r\\nthe thing to do it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor does this\\xe2\\x80\\x94its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the graceful flexion\\r\\nof its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates through a Titanism of\\r\\npower. On the contrary, those motions derive their most appalling beauty from\\r\\nit. Real strength never impairs beauty or harmony, but it often bestows it; and\\r\\nin everything imposingly beautiful, strength has much to do with the magic.\\r\\nTake away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the\\r\\ncarved Hercules, and its charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the\\r\\nlinen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with the\\r\\nmassive chest of the man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch. When Angelo\\r\\npaints even God the Father in human form, mark what robustness is there. And\\r\\nwhatever they may reveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled,\\r\\nhermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which his idea has been most successfully\\r\\nembodied; these pictures, so destitute as they are of all brawniness, hint\\r\\nnothing of any power, but the mere negative, feminine one of submission and\\r\\nendurance, which on all hands it is conceded, form the peculiar practical\\r\\nvirtues of his teachings.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSuch is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether wielded in\\r\\nsport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it be in, its flexions\\r\\nare invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein no fairy\\'s arm can transcend\\r\\nit.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFive great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for\\r\\nprogression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in sweeping; Fourth,\\r\\nin lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFirst: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan\\'s tail acts in a\\r\\ndifferent manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never wriggles.\\r\\nIn man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the whale his tail is\\r\\nthe sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled forwards beneath the body, and\\r\\nthen rapidly sprung backwards, it is this which gives that singular darting,\\r\\nleaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve\\r\\nto steer by.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSecond: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only fights\\r\\nanother sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his conflicts with\\r\\nman, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In striking at a boat, he\\r\\nswiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the blow is only inflicted by the\\r\\nrecoil. If it be made in the unobstructed air, especially if it descend to its\\r\\nmark, the stroke is then simply irresistible. No ribs of man or boat can\\r\\nwithstand it. Your only salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways\\r\\nthrough the opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the\\r\\nwhale-boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib or a dashed\\r\\nplank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally the most serious\\r\\nresult. These submerged side blows are so often received in the fishery, that\\r\\nthey are accounted mere child\\'s play. Some one strips off a frock, and the hole\\r\\nis stopped.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThird: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale the sense\\r\\nof touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect there is a delicacy\\r\\nin it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephant\\'s trunk. This delicacy is\\r\\nchiefly evinced in the action of sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the\\r\\nwhale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side\\r\\nupon the surface of the sea; and if he feel but a sailor\\'s whisker, woe to that\\r\\nsailor, whiskers and all. What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch!\\r\\nHad this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of\\r\\nDarmonodes\\' elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with low\\r\\nsalutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their zones. On\\r\\nmore accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not possess this\\r\\nprehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard of yet another elephant, that\\r\\nwhen wounded in the fight, curved round his trunk and extracted the dart.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle\\r\\nof solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity,\\r\\nand kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth. But still you\\r\\nsee his power in his play. The broad palms of his tail are flirted high into\\r\\nthe air! then smiting the surface, the thunderous concussion resounds for\\r\\nmiles. You would almost think a great gun had been discharged; and if you\\r\\nnoticed the light wreath of vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity, you\\r\\nwould think that that was the smoke from the touch-hole.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes lies\\r\\nconsiderably below the level of his back, they are then completely out of sight\\r\\nbeneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into the deeps, his entire\\r\\nflukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect in the air, and\\r\\nso remain vibrating a moment, till they downwards shoot out of view. Excepting\\r\\nthe sublime breach\\xe2\\x80\\x94 somewhere else to be described\\xe2\\x80\\x94this peaking of the whale\\'s\\r\\nflukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of\\r\\nthe bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at\\r\\nthe highest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth\\r\\nhis tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in gazing at\\r\\nsuch scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in the Dantean, the\\r\\ndevils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the archangels. Standing at the\\r\\nmast-head of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a\\r\\nlarge herd of whales in the east, all heading towards the sun, and for a moment\\r\\nvibrating in concert with peaked flukes. As it seemed to me at the time, such a\\r\\ngrand embodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the\\r\\nhome of the fire worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African\\r\\nelephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout of all\\r\\nbeings. For according to King Juba, the military elephants of antiquity often\\r\\nhailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest silence.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the elephant, so\\r\\nfar as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are\\r\\nconcerned, should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an equality,\\r\\nmuch less the creatures to which they respectively belong. For as the mightiest\\r\\nelephant is but a terrier to Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan\\'s tail, his\\r\\ntrunk is but the stalk of a lily. The most direful blow from the elephant\\'s\\r\\ntrunk were as the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and\\r\\ncrash of the sperm whale\\'s ponderous flukes, which in repeated instances have\\r\\none after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews into the\\r\\nair, very much as an Indian juggler tosses his balls.*\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n*Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and the\\r\\nelephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the elephant stands in\\r\\nmuch the same respect to the whale that a dog does to the elephant;\\r\\nnevertheless, there are not wanting some points of curious similitude; among\\r\\nthese is the spout. It is well known that the elephant will often draw up water\\r\\nor dust in his trunk, and then elevating it, jet it forth in a stream.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my inability to\\r\\nexpress it. At times there are gestures in it, which, though they would well\\r\\ngrace the hand of man, remain wholly inexplicable. In an extensive herd, so\\r\\nremarkable, occasionally, are these mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters\\r\\nwho have declared them akin to Free-Mason signs and symbols; that the whale,\\r\\nindeed, by these methods intelligently conversed with the world. Nor are there\\r\\nwanting other motions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness,\\r\\nand unaccountable to his most experienced assailant. Dissect him how I may,\\r\\nthen, I but go skin deep. I know him not, and never will. But if I know not\\r\\neven the tail of this whale, how understand his head? much more, how comprehend\\r\\nhis face, when face he has none? Thou shalt see my back parts, my tail, he\\r\\nseems to say, but my face shall not be seen. But I cannot completely make out\\r\\nhis back parts; and hint what he will about his face, I say again he has no\\r\\nface.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 87</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Grand Armada\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward from the\\r\\nterritories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all Asia. In a\\r\\ncontinuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of Sumatra, Java,\\r\\nBally, and Timor; which, with many others, form a vast mole, or rampart,\\r\\nlengthwise connecting Asia with Australia, and dividing the long unbroken\\r\\nIndian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes. This rampart is\\r\\npierced by several sally-ports for the convenience of ships and whales;\\r\\nconspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and Malacca. By the straits of\\r\\nSunda, chiefly, vessels bound to China from the west, emerge into the China\\r\\nseas.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThose narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing midway in\\r\\nthat vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green promontory, known\\r\\nto seamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond to the central gateway\\r\\nopening into some vast walled empire: and considering the inexhaustible wealth\\r\\nof spices, and silks, and jewels, and gold, and ivory, with which the thousand\\r\\nislands of that oriental sea are enriched, it seems a significant provision of\\r\\nnature, that such treasures, by the very formation of the land, should at least\\r\\nbear the appearance, however ineffectual, of being guarded from the\\r\\nall-grasping western world. The shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied\\r\\nwith those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the\\r\\nMediterranean, the Baltic, and the Propontis. Unlike the Danes, these Orientals\\r\\ndo not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from the endless\\r\\nprocession of ships before the wind, which for centuries past, by night and by\\r\\nday, have passed between the islands of Sumatra and Java, freighted with the\\r\\ncostliest cargoes of the east. But while they freely waive a ceremonial like\\r\\nthis, they do by no means renounce their claim to more solid tribute.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTime out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the low\\r\\nshaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the vessels sailing\\r\\nthrough the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the point of their spears.\\r\\nThough by the repeated bloody chastisements they have received at the hands of\\r\\nEuropean cruisers, the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat\\r\\nrepressed; yet, even at the present day, we occasionally hear of English and\\r\\nAmerican vessels, which, in those waters, have been remorselessly boarded and\\r\\npillaged.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWith a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits; Ahab\\r\\npurposing to pass through them into the Java sea, and thence, cruising\\r\\nnorthwards, over waters known to be frequented here and there by the Sperm\\r\\nWhale, sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands, and gain the far coast of\\r\\nJapan, in time for the great whaling season there. By these means, the\\r\\ncircumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost all the known Sperm Whale cruising\\r\\ngrounds of the world, previous to descending upon the Line in the Pacific;\\r\\nwhere Ahab, though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted upon\\r\\ngiving battle to Moby Dick, in the sea he was most known to frequent; and at a\\r\\nseason when he might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his crew drink\\r\\nair? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a long time, now, the\\r\\ncircus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs no sustenance but\\r\\nwhat\\'s in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the whaler. While other hulls\\r\\nare loaded down with alien stuff, to be transferred to foreign wharves; the\\r\\nworld-wandering whale-ship carries no cargo but herself and crew, their weapons\\r\\nand their wants. She has a whole lake\\'s contents bottled in her ample hold. She\\r\\nis ballasted with utilities; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and\\r\\nkentledge. She carries years\\' water in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water;\\r\\nwhich, when three years afloat, the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to\\r\\ndrink before the brackish fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks, from the\\r\\nPeruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, that, while other ships may have gone\\r\\nto China from New York, and back again, touching at a score of ports, the\\r\\nwhale-ship, in all that interval, may not have sighted one grain of soil; her\\r\\ncrew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves. So that did you\\r\\ncarry them the news that another flood had come; they would only answer\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Well,\\r\\nboys, here\\'s the ark!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of Java, in\\r\\nthe near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of the ground,\\r\\nroundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for\\r\\ncruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more and more upon Java Head, the\\r\\nlook-outs were repeatedly hailed, and admonished to keep wide awake. But though\\r\\nthe green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with\\r\\ndelighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single\\r\\njet was descried. Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game\\r\\nhereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the customary\\r\\ncheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle of singular\\r\\nmagnificence saluted us.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with which of\\r\\nlate they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm Whales, instead of\\r\\nalmost invariably sailing in small detached companies, as in former times, are\\r\\nnow frequently met with in extensive herds, sometimes embracing so great a\\r\\nmultitude, that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn\\r\\nsolemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection. To this\\r\\naggregation of the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans, may be imputed the\\r\\ncircumstance that even in the best cruising grounds, you may now sometimes sail\\r\\nfor weeks and months together, without being greeted by a single spout; and\\r\\nthen be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBroad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and forming a\\r\\ngreat semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a continuous chain\\r\\nof whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the noon-day air. Unlike the\\r\\nstraight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right Whale, which, dividing at top,\\r\\nfalls over in two branches, like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow, the\\r\\nsingle forward-slanting spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush\\r\\nof white mist, continually rising and falling away to leeward.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSeen from the Pequod\\'s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of the sea,\\r\\nthis host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into the air, and beheld\\r\\nthrough a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed like the thousand cheerful\\r\\nchimneys of some dense metropolis, descried of a balmy autumnal morning, by\\r\\nsome horseman on a height.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,\\r\\naccelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in their\\r\\nrear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain; even so did\\r\\nthis vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through the straits;\\r\\ngradually contracting the wings of their semicircle, and swimming on, in one\\r\\nsolid, but still crescentic centre.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCrowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers handling their\\r\\nweapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats. If\\r\\nthe wind only held, little doubt had they, that chased through these Straits of\\r\\nSunda, the vast host would only deploy into the Oriental seas to witness the\\r\\ncapture of not a few of their number. And who could tell whether, in that\\r\\ncongregated caravan, Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like\\r\\nthe worshipped white-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So\\r\\nwith stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans\\r\\nbefore us; when, of a sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly directing\\r\\nattention to something in our wake.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCorresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our rear. It\\r\\nseemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling something like the\\r\\nspouts of the whales; only they did not so completely come and go; for they\\r\\nconstantly hovered, without finally disappearing. Levelling his glass at this\\r\\nsight, Ahab quickly revolved in his pivot-hole, crying, \"Aloft there, and rig\\r\\nwhips and buckets to wet the sails;\\xe2\\x80\\x94Malays, sir, and after us!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should fairly have\\r\\nentered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in hot pursuit, to make\\r\\nup for their over-cautious delay. But when the swift Pequod, with a fresh\\r\\nleading wind, was herself in hot chase; how very kind of these tawny\\r\\nphilanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuit,\\xe2\\x80\\x94 mere\\r\\nriding-whips and rowels to her, that they were. As with glass under arm, Ahab\\r\\nto-and-fro paced the deck; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he\\r\\nchased, and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him; some such\\r\\nfancy as the above seemed his. And when he glanced upon the green walls of the\\r\\nwatery defile in which the ship was then sailing, and bethought him that\\r\\nthrough that gate lay the route to his vengeance, and beheld, how that through\\r\\nthat same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end; and\\r\\nnot only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical\\r\\ndevils were infernally cheering him on with their curses;\\xe2\\x80\\x94when all these\\r\\nconceits had passed through his brain, Ahab\\'s brow was left gaunt and ribbed,\\r\\nlike the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it, without\\r\\nbeing able to drag the firm thing from its place.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and when, after\\r\\nsteadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the Pequod at last shot by\\r\\nthe vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra side, emerging at last upon the\\r\\nbroad waters beyond; then, the harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift\\r\\nwhales had been gaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so\\r\\nvictoriously gained upon the Malays. But still driving on in the wake of the\\r\\nwhales, at length they seemed abating their speed; gradually the ship neared\\r\\nthem; and the wind now dying away, word was passed to spring to the boats. But\\r\\nno sooner did the herd, by some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale,\\r\\nbecome notified of the three keels that were after them,\\xe2\\x80\\x94 though as yet a mile\\r\\nin their rear,\\xe2\\x80\\x94than they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and\\r\\nbattalions, so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked\\r\\nbayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nStripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and after\\r\\nseveral hours\\' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase, when a\\r\\ngeneral pausing commotion among the whales gave animating tokens that they were\\r\\nnow at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert\\r\\nirresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive it in the whale, they say he\\r\\nis gallied*. The compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto\\r\\nrapidly and steadily swimming, were now broken up in one measureless rout; and\\r\\nlike King Porus\\' elephants in the Indian battle with Alexander, they seemed\\r\\ngoing mad with consternation. In all directions expanding in vast irregular\\r\\ncircles, and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by their short thick\\r\\nspoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic. This was still\\r\\nmore strangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely paralysed as\\r\\nit were, helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled ships on the sea. Had\\r\\nthese Leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over the pasture by\\r\\nthree fierce wolves, they could not possibly have evinced such excessive\\r\\ndismay. But this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding\\r\\ncreatures. Though banding together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned\\r\\nbuffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all\\r\\nhuman beings, how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre\\'s pit,\\r\\nthey will, at the slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets,\\r\\ncrowding, trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death.\\r\\nBest, therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before\\r\\nus, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely\\r\\noutdone by the madness of men.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n* To gally, or gallow, is to frighten excessively\\xe2\\x80\\x94 to confound with fright. It\\r\\nis an old Saxon word. It occurs once in Shakespeare:\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe wrathful skies Gallow the very wanderers of the dark And make them keep\\r\\ntheir caves.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTo common language, the word is now completely obsolete. When the polite\\r\\nlandsman first hears it from the gaunt Nantucketer, he is apt to set it down as\\r\\none of the whaleman\\'s self-derived savageries. Much the same is it with many\\r\\nother sinewy Saxonisms of this sort, which emigrated to New-England rocks with\\r\\nthe noble brawn of the old English emigrants in the time of the Commonwealth.\\r\\nThus, some of the best and furthest-descended English words\\xe2\\x80\\x94the etymological\\r\\nHowards and Percys\\xe2\\x80\\x94are now democratised, nay, plebeianised\\xe2\\x80\\x94so to speak\\xe2\\x80\\x94 in the\\r\\nNew World.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThough many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion, yet it is\\r\\nto be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated, but\\r\\ncollectively remained in one place. As is customary in those cases, the boats\\r\\nat once separated, each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the\\r\\nshoal. In about three minutes\\' time, Queequeg\\'s harpoon was flung; the stricken\\r\\nfish darted blinding spray in our faces, and then running away with us like\\r\\nlight, steered straight for the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on\\r\\nthe part of the whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise\\r\\nunprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated; yet does\\r\\nit present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. For as the\\r\\nswift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid adieu\\r\\nto circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of speed to\\r\\nrid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we thus tore a white\\r\\ngash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by the crazed creatures to\\r\\nand fro rushing about us; our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in\\r\\na tempest, and striving to steer through their complicated channels and\\r\\nstraits, knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off from this\\r\\nmonster directly across our route in advance; now edging away from that, whose\\r\\ncolossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the time, Starbuck stood up\\r\\nin the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our way whatever whales he could\\r\\nreach by short darts, for there was no time to make long ones. Nor were the\\r\\noarsmen quite idle, though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with.\\r\\nThey chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business. \"Out of the way,\\r\\nCommodore!\" cried one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the\\r\\nsurface, and for an instant threatened to swamp us. \"Hard down with your tail,\\r\\nthere!\" cried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed calmly\\r\\ncooling himself with his own fan-like extremity.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAll whale-boats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented by the\\r\\nNantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of equal size are\\r\\nstoutly clenched together, so that they cross each other\\'s grain at right\\r\\nangles; a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this\\r\\nblock, and the other end of the line being looped, it can in a moment be\\r\\nfastened to a harpoon. It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is\\r\\nused. For then, more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at\\r\\none time. But sperm whales are not every day encountered; while you may, then,\\r\\nyou must kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you must\\r\\nwing them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it is,\\r\\nthat at times like these the drug, comes into requisition. Our boat was\\r\\nfurnished with three of them. The first and second were successfully darted,\\r\\nand we saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous\\r\\nsidelong resistance of the towing drugg. They were cramped like malefactors\\r\\nwith the chain and ball. But upon flinging the third, in the act of tossing\\r\\noverboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the\\r\\nboat, and in an instant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman\\r\\nin the boat\\'s bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the sea\\r\\ncame in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts\\r\\nin, and so stopped the leaks for the time.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it not that\\r\\nas we advanced into the herd, our whale\\'s way greatly diminished; moreover,\\r\\nthat as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion,\\r\\nthe direful disorders seemed waning. So that when at last the jerking harpoon\\r\\ndrew out, and the towing whale sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force\\r\\nof his parting momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart\\r\\nof the shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley\\r\\nlake. Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales, were\\r\\nheard but not felt. In this central expanse the sea presented that smooth\\r\\nsatin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by the subtle moisture thrown off\\r\\nby the whale in his more quiet moods. Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm\\r\\nwhich they say lurks at the heart of every commotion. And still in the\\r\\ndistracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and\\r\\nsaw successive pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and\\r\\nround, like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder to\\r\\nshoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the middle\\r\\nones, and so have gone round on their backs. Owing to the density of the crowd\\r\\nof reposing whales, more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd,\\r\\nno possible chance of escape was at present afforded us. We must watch for a\\r\\nbreach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that had only admitted us\\r\\nin order to shut us up. Keeping at the centre of the lake, we were occasionally\\r\\nvisited by small tame cows and calves; the women and children of this routed\\r\\nhost.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer\\r\\ncircles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any one of\\r\\nthose circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by the whole\\r\\nmultitude, must have contained at least two or three square miles. At any\\r\\nrate\\xe2\\x80\\x94though indeed such a test at such a time might be deceptive\\xe2\\x80\\x94spoutings\\r\\nmight be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the\\r\\nrim of the horizon. I mention this circumstance, because, as if the cows and\\r\\ncalves had been purposely locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide\\r\\nextent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause\\r\\nof its stopping; or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way\\r\\ninnocent and inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller whales\\xe2\\x80\\x94 now\\r\\nand then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake\\xe2\\x80\\x94 evinced a\\r\\nwondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still becharmed panic which it\\r\\nwas impossible not to marvel at. Like household dogs they came snuffling round\\r\\nus, right up to our gunwales, and touching them; till it almost seemed that\\r\\nsome spell had suddenly domesticated them. Queequeg patted their foreheads;\\r\\nStarbuck scratched their backs with his lance; but fearful of the consequences,\\r\\nfor the time refrained from darting it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still\\r\\nstranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended in those\\r\\nwatery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales, and\\r\\nthose that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers. The lake,\\r\\nas I have hinted, was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent; and as\\r\\nhuman infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast,\\r\\nas if leading two different lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal\\r\\nnourishment, be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly\\r\\nreminiscence;\\xe2\\x80\\x94even so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us,\\r\\nbut not at us, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight.\\r\\nFloating on their sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One of\\r\\nthese little infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old,\\r\\nmight have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in girth.\\r\\nHe was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from\\r\\nthat irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal reticule;\\r\\nwhere, tail to head, and all ready for the final spring, the unborn whale lies\\r\\nbent like a Tartar\\'s bow. The delicate side-fins, and the palms of his flukes,\\r\\nstill freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby\\'s ears newly\\r\\narrived from foreign parts.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Line! line!\" cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; \"him fast! him\\r\\nfast!\\xe2\\x80\\x94Who line him! Who struck?\\xe2\\x80\\x94Two whale; one big, one little!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What ails ye, man?\" cried Starbuck.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Look-e here,\" said Queequeg, pointing down.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of\\r\\nfathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and shows the\\r\\nslackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the air; so now,\\r\\nStarbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame Leviathan, by which the\\r\\nyoung cub seemed still tethered to its dam. Not seldom in the rapid\\r\\nvicissitudes of the chase, this natural line, with the maternal end loose,\\r\\nbecomes entangled with the hempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped. Some\\r\\nof the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted\\r\\npond. We saw young Leviathan amours in the deep.*\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n*The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but unlike most\\r\\nother fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a gestation which may\\r\\nprobably be set down at nine months, producing but one at a time; though in\\r\\nsome few known instances giving birth to an Esau and Jacob:\\xe2\\x80\\x94a contingency\\r\\nprovided for in suckling by two teats, curiously situated, one on each side of\\r\\nthe anus; but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that. When by chance\\r\\nthese precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter\\'s lance, the\\r\\nmother\\'s pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolor the sea for rods. The milk\\r\\nis very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well with\\r\\nstrawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales salute more\\r\\nhominum.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and\\r\\naffrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and fearlessly\\r\\nindulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled in dalliance and\\r\\ndelight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of my being, do I myself\\r\\nstill for ever centrally disport in mute calm; and while ponderous planets of\\r\\nunwaning woe revolve round me, deep down and deep inland there I still bathe me\\r\\nin eternal mildness of joy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMeanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic spectacles\\r\\nin the distance evinced the activity of the other boats, still engaged in\\r\\ndrugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or possibly carrying on the\\r\\nwar within the first circle, where abundance of room and some convenient\\r\\nretreats were afforded them. But the sight of the enraged drugged whales now\\r\\nand then blindly darting to and fro across the circles, was nothing to what at\\r\\nlast met our eyes. It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than\\r\\ncommonly powerful and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering\\r\\nor maiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled\\r\\ncutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A whale\\r\\nwounded (as we afterwards learned) in this part, but not effectually, as it\\r\\nseemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying along with him half of the\\r\\nharpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony of the wound, he was now dashing\\r\\namong the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the\\r\\nbattle of Saratoga, carrying dismay wherever he went.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling spectacle\\r\\nenough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the\\r\\nrest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first the intervening distance\\r\\nobscured from us. But at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable\\r\\naccidents of the fishery, this whale had become entangled in the harpoon-line\\r\\nthat he towed; he had also run away with the cutting-spade in him; and while\\r\\nthe free end of the rope attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the\\r\\ncoils of the harpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked\\r\\nloose from his flesh. So that tormented to madness, he was now churning through\\r\\nthe water, violently flailing with his flexible tail, and tossing the keen\\r\\nspade about him, wounding and murdering his own comrades.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThis terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary\\r\\nfright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a\\r\\nlittle, and tumble against each other, as if lifted by half spent billows from\\r\\nafar; then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell; the submarine\\r\\nbridal-chambers and nurseries vanished; in more and more contracting orbits the\\r\\nwhales in the more central circles began to swim in thickening clusters. Yes,\\r\\nthe long calm was departing. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like\\r\\nto the tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in\\r\\nSpring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre, as if\\r\\nto pile themselves up in one common mountain. Instantly Starbuck and Queequeg\\r\\nchanged places; Starbuck taking the stern.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Oars! Oars!\" he intensely whispered, seizing the helm\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"gripe your oars, and\\r\\nclutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove him off, you Queequeg\\xe2\\x80\\x94the\\r\\nwhale there!\\xe2\\x80\\x94prick him!\\xe2\\x80\\x94hit him! Stand up\\xe2\\x80\\x94stand up, and stay so! Spring\\r\\nmen\\xe2\\x80\\x94pull, men; never mind their backs\\xe2\\x80\\x94scrape them!\\xe2\\x80\\x94scrape away!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a narrow\\r\\nDardanelles between their long lengths. But by desperate endeavor we at last\\r\\nshot into a temporary opening; then giving way rapidly, and at the same time\\r\\nearnestly watching for another outlet. After many similar hair-breadth escapes,\\r\\nwe at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles, but\\r\\nnow crossed by random whales, all violently making for one centre. This lucky\\r\\nsalvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg\\'s hat, who, while\\r\\nstanding in the bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from\\r\\nhis head by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes\\r\\nclose by.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nRiotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon resolved\\r\\nitself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having clumped together at\\r\\nlast in one dense body, they then renewed their onward flight with augmented\\r\\nfleetness. Further pursuit was useless; but the boats still lingered in their\\r\\nwake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern, and likewise to\\r\\nsecure one which Flask had killed and waited. The waif is a pennoned pole, two\\r\\nor three of which are carried by every boat; and which, when additional game is\\r\\nat hand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale, both to\\r\\nmark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior possession, should the\\r\\nboats of any other ship draw near.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious saying\\r\\nin the Fishery,\\xe2\\x80\\x94the more whales the less fish. Of all the drugged whales only\\r\\none was captured. The rest contrived to escape for the time, but only to be\\r\\ntaken, as will hereafter be seen, by some other craft than the Pequod.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 88</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSchools and Schoolmasters\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm Whales,\\r\\nand there was also then given the probable cause inducing those vast\\r\\naggregations.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must have been\\r\\nseen, even at the present day, small detached bands are occasionally observed,\\r\\nembracing from twenty to fifty individuals each. Such bands are known as\\r\\nschools. They generally are of two sorts; those composed almost entirely of\\r\\nfemales, and those mustering none but young vigorous males, or bulls as they\\r\\nare familiarly designated.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a male of\\r\\nfull grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces his gallantry\\r\\nby falling in the rear and covering the flight of his ladies. In truth, this\\r\\ngentleman is a luxurious Ottoman, swimming about over the watery world,\\r\\nsurroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem. The\\r\\ncontrast between this Ottoman and his concubines is striking; because, while he\\r\\nis always of the largest leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full\\r\\ngrowth, are not more than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They\\r\\nare comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen\\r\\nyards round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the whole\\r\\nthey are hereditarily entitled to en bon point.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent\\r\\nramblings. Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in leisurely search\\r\\nof variety. You meet them on the Line in time for the full flower of the\\r\\nEquatorial feeding season, having just returned, perhaps, from spending the\\r\\nsummer in the Northern seas, and so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness\\r\\nand warmth. By the time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the\\r\\nEquator awhile, they start for the Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool\\r\\nseason there, and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange suspicious\\r\\nsights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his interesting family.\\r\\nShould any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan coming that way, presume to draw\\r\\nconfidentially close to one of the ladies, with what prodigious fury the Bashaw\\r\\nassails him, and chases him away! High times, indeed, if unprincipled young\\r\\nrakes like him are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss;\\r\\nthough do what the Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out\\r\\nof his bed; for alas! all fish bed in common. As ashore, the ladies often cause\\r\\nthe most terrible duels among their rival admirers; just so with the whales,\\r\\nwho sometimes come to deadly battle, and all for love. They fence with their\\r\\nlong lower jaws, sometimes locking them together, and so striving for the\\r\\nsupremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers. Not a few are\\r\\ncaptured having the deep scars of these encounters,\\xe2\\x80\\x94 furrowed heads, broken\\r\\nteeth, scolloped fins; and in some instances, wrenched and dislocated mouths.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the first\\r\\nrush of the harem\\'s lord, then is it very diverting to watch that lord. Gently\\r\\nhe insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile, still in\\r\\ntantalizing vicinity to young Lothario, like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping\\r\\namong his thousand concubines. Granting other whales to be in sight, the\\r\\nfisherman will seldom give chase to one of these Grand Turks; for these Grand\\r\\nTurks are too lavish of their strength, and hence their unctuousness is small.\\r\\nAs for the sons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons and daughters\\r\\nmust take care of themselves; at least, with only the maternal help. For like\\r\\ncertain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named, my Lord Whale has\\r\\nno taste for the nursery, however much for the bower; and so, being a great\\r\\ntraveller, he leaves his anonymous babies all over the world; every baby an\\r\\nexotic. In good time, nevertheless, as the ardor of youth declines; as years\\r\\nand dumps increase; as reflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a\\r\\ngeneral lassitude overtakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and virtue\\r\\nsupplants the love for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent,\\r\\nrepentant, admonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands the harem, and grown\\r\\nto an exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all alone among the meridians and\\r\\nparallels saying his prayers, and warning each young Leviathan from his amorous\\r\\nerrors.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so is the lord\\r\\nand master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster. It is\\r\\ntherefore not in strict character, however admirably satirical, that after\\r\\ngoing to school himself, he should then go abroad inculcating not what he\\r\\nlearned there, but the folly of it. His title, schoolmaster, would very\\r\\nnaturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself, but some\\r\\nhave surmised that the man who first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale,\\r\\nmust have read the memoirs of Vidocq, and informed himself what sort of a\\r\\ncountry-schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his younger days, and what\\r\\nwas the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of his pupils.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes\\r\\nhimself in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm Whales. Almost\\r\\nuniversally, a lone whale\\xe2\\x80\\x94 as a solitary Leviathan is called\\xe2\\x80\\x94proves an ancient\\r\\none. Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone, he will have no one near him but\\r\\nNature herself; and her he takes to wife in the wilderness of waters, and the\\r\\nbest of wives she is, though she keeps so many moody secrets.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously mentioned,\\r\\noffer a strong contrast to the harem schools. For while those female whales are\\r\\ncharacteristically timid, the young males, or forty-barrel-bulls, as they call\\r\\nthem, are by far the most pugnacious of all Leviathans, and proverbially the\\r\\nmost dangerous to encounter; excepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled\\r\\nwhales, sometimes met, and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by\\r\\na penal gout.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools. Like a mob of\\r\\nyoung collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and wickedness, tumbling round\\r\\nthe world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no prudent underwriter\\r\\nwould insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at Yale or Harvard. They\\r\\nsoon relinquish this turbulence though, and when about three-fourths grown,\\r\\nbreak up, and separately go about in quest of settlements, that is, harems.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnother point of difference between the male and female schools is still more\\r\\ncharacteristic of the sexes. Say you strike a Forty-barrel-bull\\xe2\\x80\\x94poor devil! all\\r\\nhis comrades quit him. But strike a member of the harem school, and her\\r\\ncompanions swim around her with every token of concern, sometimes lingering so\\r\\nnear her and so long, as themselves to fall a prey.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 89</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFast-Fish and Loose-Fish\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe allusion to the waifs and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,\\r\\nnecessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery, of\\r\\nwhich the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company, a whale\\r\\nmay be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed and captured by\\r\\nanother vessel; and herein are indirectly comprised many minor contingencies,\\r\\nall partaking of this one grand feature. For example,\\xe2\\x80\\x94after a weary and\\r\\nperilous chase and capture of a whale, the body may get loose from the ship by\\r\\nreason of a violent storm; and drifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a\\r\\nsecond whaler, who, in a calm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life\\r\\nor line. Thus the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between\\r\\nthe fishermen, were there not some written or unwritten, universal, undisputed\\r\\nlaw applicable to all cases.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPerhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment, was\\r\\nthat of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in A.D. 1695. But though\\r\\nno other nation has ever had any written whaling law, yet the American\\r\\nfishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter. They have\\r\\nprovided a system which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian\\'s\\r\\nPandects and the By-laws of the Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling\\r\\nwith other People\\'s Business. Yes; these laws might be engraven on a Queen\\r\\nAnne\\'s farthing, or the barb of a harpoon, and worn round the neck, so small\\r\\nare they.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI. A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nII. A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of\\r\\nit, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFirst: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast, when it\\r\\nis connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at all controllable\\r\\nby the occupant or occupants,\\xe2\\x80\\x94a mast, an oar, a nine-inch cable, a telegraph\\r\\nwire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all the same. Likewise a fish is technically\\r\\nfast when it bears a waif, or any other recognized symbol of possession; so\\r\\nlong as the party wailing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take\\r\\nit alongside, as well as their intention so to do.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThese are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen\\r\\nthemselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the\\r\\nCoke-upon-Littleton of the fist. True, among the more upright and honorable\\r\\nwhalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases, where it would be an\\r\\noutrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale\\r\\npreviously chased or killed by another party. But others are by no means so\\r\\nscrupulous.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSome fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated in\\r\\nEngland, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in\\r\\nthe Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had succeeded in\\r\\nharpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of their lives, obliged\\r\\nto forsake not only their lines, but their boat itself. Ultimately the\\r\\ndefendants (the crew of another ship) came up with the whale, struck, killed,\\r\\nseized, and finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs. And\\r\\nwhen those defendants were remonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers\\r\\nin the plaintiffs\\' teeth, and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed\\r\\nhe had done, he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had\\r\\nremained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure. Wherefore the\\r\\nplaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale, line,\\r\\nharpoons, and boat.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the judge. In\\r\\nthe course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to illustrate his\\r\\nposition, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case, wherein a gentleman, after\\r\\nin vain trying to bridle his wife\\'s viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon\\r\\nthe seas of life; but in the course of years, repenting of that step, he\\r\\ninstituted an action to recover possession of her. Erskine was on the other\\r\\nside; and he then supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had\\r\\noriginally harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of\\r\\nthe great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned her; yet\\r\\nabandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and therefore when a\\r\\nsubsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then became that subsequent\\r\\ngentleman\\'s property, along with whatever harpoon might have been found\\r\\nsticking in her.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale and\\r\\nthe lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThese pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very learned\\r\\nJudge in set terms decided, to wit,\\xe2\\x80\\x94 That as for the boat, he awarded it to the\\r\\nplaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives; but that\\r\\nwith regard to the controverted whale, harpoons, and line, they belonged to the\\r\\ndefendants; the whale, because it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final\\r\\ncapture; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them, it\\r\\n(the fish) acquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who\\r\\nafterwards took the fish had a right to them. Now the defendants afterwards\\r\\ntook the fish; ergo, the aforesaid articles were theirs.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge, might possibly\\r\\nobject to it. But ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter, the two great\\r\\nprinciples laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted, and applied\\r\\nand elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in the above cited case; these two laws\\r\\ntouching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish, I say, will on reflection, be found the\\r\\nfundamentals of all human jurisprudence; For notwithstanding its complicated\\r\\ntracery of sculpture, the Temple of the Law, like the Temple of the\\r\\nPhilistines, has but two props to stand on.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIs it not a saying in every one\\'s mouth, Possession is half of the law: that\\r\\nis, regardless of how the thing came into possession? But often possession is\\r\\nthe whole of the law. What are the sinews and souls of Russian serfs and\\r\\nRepublican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof possession is the whole of the law?\\r\\nWhat to the rapacious landlord is the widow\\'s last mite but a Fast-Fish? What\\r\\nis yonder undetected villain\\'s marble mansion with a doorplate for a waif; what\\r\\nis that but a Fast-Fish?

A division which, in the whale, is\\r\\nmuch like halving an apple; there is no intermediate remainder. Now as this\\r\\nlaw, under a modified form, is to this day in force in England; and as it\\r\\noffers in various respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of\\r\\nFast\\xe2\\x80\\x94and Loose-Fish, it is here treated of in a separate chapter, on the same\\r\\ncourteous principle that prompts the English railways to be at the expense of a\\r\\nseparate car, specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty. In the first\\r\\nplace, in curious proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is still in\\r\\nforce, I proceed to lay before you a circumstance-that happened within the last\\r\\ntwo years.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one of the\\r\\nCinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a fine\\r\\nwhale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore. Now the\\r\\nCinque Ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of\\r\\npoliceman or beadle, called a Lord Warden. Holding the office directly from the\\r\\ncrown, I believe, all the royal emoluments incident to the Cinque Port\\r\\nterritories become by assignment his. By some writers this office is called a\\r\\nsinecure. But not so. Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in\\r\\nfobbing his perquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing\\r\\nof them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their trowsers\\r\\nrolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their fat fish high and\\r\\ndry, promising themselves a good 150 pounds from the precious oil and bone; and\\r\\nin fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives, and good ale with their cronies,\\r\\nupon the strength of their respective shares; up steps a very learned and most\\r\\nChristian and charitable gentleman, with a copy of Blackstone under his arm;\\r\\nand laying it upon the whale\\'s head, he says\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Hands off! this fish, my masters,\\r\\nis a Fast-Fish. I seize it as the Lord Warden\\'s.\" Upon this the poor mariners\\r\\nin their respectful consternation\\xe2\\x80\\x94so truly English\\xe2\\x80\\x94 knowing not what to say,\\r\\nfall to vigorously scratching their heads all round; meanwhile ruefully\\r\\nglancing from the whale to the stranger. But that did in nowise mend the\\r\\nmatter, or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy\\r\\nof Blackstone. At length one of them, after long scratching about for his\\r\\nideas, made bold to speak,\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"The Duke.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"It is his.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is all that to\\r\\ngo to the Duke\\'s benefit; we getting nothing at all for our pains but our\\r\\nblisters?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"It is his.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of getting a\\r\\nlivelihood?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"It is his.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of this\\r\\nwhale.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"It is his.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Won\\'t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"It is his.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of Wellington\\r\\nreceived the money. Thinking that viewed in some particular lights, the case\\r\\nmight by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed, under the\\r\\ncircumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman of the town respectfully\\r\\naddressed a note to his Grace, begging him to take the case of those\\r\\nunfortunate mariners into full consideration. To which my Lord Duke in\\r\\nsubstance replied (both letters were published) that he had already done so,\\r\\nand received the money, and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if for\\r\\nthe future he (the reverend gentleman) would decline meddling with other\\r\\npeople\\'s business. Is this the still militant old man, standing at the corners\\r\\nof the three kingdoms, on all hands coercing alms of beggars?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke to the\\r\\nwhale was a delegated one from the Sovereign. We must needs inquire then on\\r\\nwhat principle the Sovereign is originally invested with that right. The law\\r\\nitself has already been set forth. But Plowdon gives us the reason for it. Says\\r\\nPlowdon, the whale so caught belongs to the King and Queen, \"because of its\\r\\nsuperior excellence.\" And by the soundest commentators this has ever been held\\r\\na cogent argument in such matters.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail?<br>\\r\\nA reason for that, ye lawyers!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn his treatise on \"Queen-Gold,\" or Queen-pin-money, an old King\\'s Bench\\r\\nauthor, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: \"Ye tail is ye Queen\\'s, that ye\\r\\nQueen\\'s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone.\" Now this was written at a\\r\\ntime when the black limber bone of the Greenland or Right whale was largely\\r\\nused in ladies\\' bodices. But this same bone is not in the tail; it is in the\\r\\nhead, which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like Prynne. But is the\\r\\nQueen a mermaid, to be presented with a tail? An allegorical meaning may lurk\\r\\nhere.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the whale and\\r\\nthe sturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations, and nominally\\r\\nsupplying the tenth branch of the crown\\'s ordinary revenue. I know not that any\\r\\nother author has hinted of the matter; but by inference it seems to me that the\\r\\nsturgeon must be divided in the same way as the whale, the King receiving the\\r\\nhighly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish, which, symbolically\\r\\nregarded, may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality.\\r\\nAnd thus there seems a reason in all things, even in law.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 91</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this Leviathan,\\r\\ninsufferable fetor denying not inquiry.\" SIR T. BROWNE, V. E.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when we were\\r\\nslowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea, that the many noses on the\\r\\nPequod\\'s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three pairs of eyes\\r\\naloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I will bet something now,\" said Stubb, \"that somewhere hereabouts are some of\\r\\nthose drugged whales we tickled the other day. I thought they would keel up\\r\\nbefore long.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPresently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the distance lay a\\r\\nship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside.\\r\\nAs we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colors from his peak; and by\\r\\nthe eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that circled, and hovered, and swooped\\r\\naround him, it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen\\r\\ncall a blasted whale, that is, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea, and\\r\\nso floated an unappropriated corpse. It may well be conceived, what an unsavory\\r\\nodor such a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague, when\\r\\nthe living are incompetent to bury the departed. So intolerable indeed is it\\r\\nregarded by some, that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it.\\r\\nYet are there those who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that the oil\\r\\nobtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality, and by no means of\\r\\nthe nature of attar-of-rose.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nComing still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman had a\\r\\nsecond whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay\\r\\nthan the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of those problematical whales\\r\\nthat seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia, or\\r\\nindigestion; leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything\\r\\nlike oil. Nevertheless, in the proper place we shall see that no knowing\\r\\nfisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this, however much he\\r\\nmay shun blasted whales in general.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he\\r\\nrecognized his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were knotted\\r\\nround the tail of one of these whales.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"There\\'s a pretty fellow, now,\" he banteringly laughed, standing in the ship\\'s\\r\\nbows, \"there\\'s a jackal for ye! I well know that these Crappoes of Frenchmen\\r\\nare but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering their boats for\\r\\nbreakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes, and sometimes sailing\\r\\nfrom their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles, and cases of\\r\\nsnuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they will get won\\'t be enough to dip the\\r\\nCaptain\\'s wick into; aye, we all know these things; but look ye, here\\'s a\\r\\nCrappo that is content with our leavings, the drugged whale there, I mean; aye,\\r\\nand is content too with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he\\r\\nhas there. Poor devil! I say, pass round a hat, some one, and let\\'s make him a\\r\\npresent of a little oil for dear charity\\'s sake. For what oil he\\'ll get from\\r\\nthat drugged whale there, wouldn\\'t be fit to burn in a jail; no, not in a\\r\\ncondemned cell. And as for the other whale, why, I\\'ll agree to get more oil by\\r\\nchopping up and trying out these three masts of ours, than he\\'ll get from that\\r\\nbundle of bones; though, now that I think of it, it may contain something worth\\r\\na good deal more than oil; yes, ambergris. I wonder now if our old man has\\r\\nthought of that. It\\'s worth trying. Yes, I\\'m for it;\" and so saying he started\\r\\nfor the quarter-deck.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether or no,\\r\\nthe Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope of escaping\\r\\nexcept by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin, Stubb now called his\\r\\nboat\\'s crew, and pulled off for the stranger. Drawing across her bow, he\\r\\nperceived that in accordance with the fanciful French taste, the upper part of\\r\\nher stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted\\r\\ngreen, and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there; the\\r\\nwhole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red color. Upon her\\r\\nhead boards, in large gilt letters, he read \"Bouton de Rose,\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94Rose-button, or\\r\\nRose-bud; and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThough Stubb did not understand the Bouton part of the inscription, yet the\\r\\nword rose, and the bulbous figure-head put together, sufficiently explained the\\r\\nwhole to him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"A wooden rose-bud, eh?\" he cried with his hand to his nose, \"that will do very\\r\\nwell; but how like all creation it smells!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he had to\\r\\npull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close to the blasted\\r\\nwhale; and so talk over it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nArrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he\\r\\nbawled\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that speak\\r\\nEnglish?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Yes,\" rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be the\\r\\nchief-mate.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What whale?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"The White Whale\\xe2\\x80\\x94a Sperm Whale\\xe2\\x80\\x94Moby Dick, have ye seen him?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale\\xe2\\x80\\x94no.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Very good, then; good bye now, and I\\'ll call again in a minute.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning over the\\r\\nquarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two hands into a trumpet\\r\\nand shouted\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"No, Sir! No!\" Upon which Ahab retired, and Stubb returned to the\\r\\nFrenchman.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the chains, and\\r\\nwas using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of bag.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter with your nose, there?\" said Stubb. \"Broke it?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I wish it was broken, or that I didn\\'t have any nose at all!\" answered the\\r\\nGuernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very much. \"But what\\r\\nare you holding yours for?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Oh, nothing! It\\'s a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain\\'t it? Air\\r\\nrather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will ye,\\r\\nBouton-de-Rose?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What in the devil\\'s name do you want here?\" roared the Guernseyman, flying\\r\\ninto a sudden passion.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Oh! keep cool\\xe2\\x80\\x94cool? yes, that\\'s the word! why don\\'t you pack those whales in\\r\\nice while you\\'re working at \\'em? But joking aside, though; do you know,\\r\\nRose-bud, that it\\'s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales? As\\r\\nfor that dried up one, there, he hasn\\'t a gill in his whole carcase.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I know that well enough; but, d\\'ye see, the Captain here won\\'t believe it;\\r\\nthis is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But come\\r\\naboard, and mayhap he\\'ll believe you, if he won\\'t me; and so I\\'ll get out of\\r\\nthis dirty scrape.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,\" rejoined Stubb, and with\\r\\nthat he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene presented itself. The\\r\\nsailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the heavy tackles in\\r\\nreadiness for the whales. But they worked rather slow and talked very fast, and\\r\\nseemed in anything but a good humor. All their noses upwardly projected from\\r\\ntheir faces like so many jibbooms. Now and then pairs of them would drop their\\r\\nwork, and run up to the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they\\r\\nwould catch the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to\\r\\ntheir nostrils. Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short off\\r\\nat the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it constantly\\r\\nfilled their olfactories.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nStubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the\\r\\nCaptain\\'s round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a fiery face\\r\\nthrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from within. This was the\\r\\ntormented surgeon, who, after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of\\r\\nthe day, had betaken himself to the Captain\\'s round-house (cabinet he called\\r\\nit) to avoid the pest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and\\r\\nindignations at times.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMarking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the\\r\\nGuernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate\\r\\nexpressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus, who had\\r\\nbrought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle. Sounding him\\r\\ncarefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man had not the slightest\\r\\nsuspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore held his peace on that head,\\r\\nbut otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him, so that the two\\r\\nquickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the\\r\\nCaptain, without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity. According\\r\\nto this little plan of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover of an\\r\\ninterpreter\\'s office, was to tell the Captain what he pleased, but as coming\\r\\nfrom Stubb; and as for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come\\r\\nuppermost in him during the interview.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a small and\\r\\ndark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with large whiskers\\r\\nand moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watch-seals at\\r\\nhis side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now politely introduced by the\\r\\nGuernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting\\r\\nbetween them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What shall I say to him first?\" said he.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Why,\" said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, \"you may as\\r\\nwell begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me, though I don\\'t\\r\\npretend to be a judge.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"He says, Monsieur,\" said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his captain,\\r\\n\"that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain and chief-mate,\\r\\nwith six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a blasted whale they had\\r\\nbrought alongside.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nUpon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What now?\" said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him carefully,\\r\\nI\\'m quite certain that he\\'s no more fit to command a whale-ship than a St. Jago\\r\\nmonkey. In fact, tell him from me he\\'s a baboon.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one, is far\\r\\nmore deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he conjures us, as we\\r\\nvalue our lives, to cut loose from these fish.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nInstantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his crew to\\r\\ndesist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast loose the cables and\\r\\nchains confining the whales to the ship.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What now?\" said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that\\xe2\\x80\\x94that\\xe2\\x80\\x94in fact, tell him\\r\\nI\\'ve diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps somebody else.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"He says, Monsieur, that he\\'s very happy to have been of any service to us.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties (meaning\\r\\nhimself and mate), and concluded by inviting Stubb down into his cabin to drink\\r\\na bottle of Bordeaux.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,\" said the interpreter.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Thank him heartily; but tell him it\\'s against my principles to drink with the\\r\\nman I\\'ve diddled. In fact, tell him I must go.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"He says, Monsieur, that his principles won\\'t admit of his drinking; but that\\r\\nif Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur had best drop all\\r\\nfour boats, and pull the ship away from these whales, for it\\'s so calm they\\r\\nwon\\'t drift.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed the\\r\\nGuernsey-man to this effect,\\xe2\\x80\\x94that having a long tow-line in his boat, he would\\r\\ndo what he could to help them, by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from\\r\\nthe ship\\'s side. While the Frenchman\\'s boats, then, were engaged in towing the\\r\\nship one way, Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way,\\r\\nostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow-line.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPresently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;\\r\\nhoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while the Pequod\\r\\nslid in between him and Stubb\\'s whale. Whereupon Stubb quickly pulled to the\\r\\nfloating body, and hailing the Pequod to give notice of his intentions, at once\\r\\nproceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning. Seizing his sharp\\r\\nboat-spade, he commenced an excavation in the body, a little behind the side\\r\\nfin. You would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea;\\r\\nand when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning\\r\\nup old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam. His boat\\'s crew were\\r\\nall in high excitement, eagerly helping their chief, and looking as anxious as\\r\\ngold-hunters.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and screaming, and\\r\\nyelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning to look disappointed,\\r\\nespecially as the horrible nosegay increased, when suddenly from out the very\\r\\nheart of this plague, there stole a faint stream of perfume, which flowed\\r\\nthrough the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it, as one river will\\r\\nflow into and then along with another, without at all blending with it for a\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I have it, I have it,\" cried Stubb, with delight, striking something in the\\r\\nsubterranean regions, \"a purse! a purse!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of something\\r\\nthat looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old cheese; very unctuous\\r\\nand savory withal. You might easily dent it with your thumb; it is of a hue\\r\\nbetween yellow and ash color. And this, good friends, is ambergris, worth a\\r\\ngold guinea an ounce to any druggist. Some six handfuls were obtained; but more\\r\\nwas unavoidably lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been\\r\\nsecured were it not for impatient Ahab\\'s loud command to Stubb to desist, and\\r\\ncome on board, else the ship would bid them good-bye.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 92</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAmbergris\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an article\\r\\nof commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain Coffin was examined\\r\\nat the bar of the English House of Commons on that subject. For at that time,\\r\\nand indeed until a comparatively late day, the precise origin of ambergris\\r\\nremained, like amber itself, a problem to the learned. Though the word\\r\\nambergris is but the French compound for grey amber, yet the two substances are\\r\\nquite distinct. For amber, though at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug\\r\\nup in some far inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the\\r\\nsea. Besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance, used\\r\\nfor mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris is soft,\\r\\nwaxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely used in perfumery,\\r\\nin pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and pomatum. The Turks use it in\\r\\ncooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense is\\r\\ncarried to St. Peter\\'s in Rome. Some wine merchants drop a few grains into\\r\\nclaret, to flavor it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWho would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale\\r\\nthemselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale! Yet\\r\\nso it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the cause, and by others the\\r\\neffect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to cure such a dyspepsia it were\\r\\nhard to say, unless by administering three or four boat loads of Brandreth\\'s\\r\\npills, and then running out of harm\\'s way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris, certain hard,\\r\\nround, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be sailors\\' trousers\\r\\nbuttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing, more than pieces\\r\\nof small squid bones embalmed in that manner.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in\\r\\nthe heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that saying of St.\\r\\nPaul in Corinthians, about corruption and incorruption; how that we are sown in\\r\\ndishonor, but raised in glory. And likewise call to mind that saying of\\r\\nParacelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk. Also forget not the\\r\\nstrange fact that of all things of ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental\\r\\nmanufacturing stages, is the worst.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but cannot, owing\\r\\nto my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen, and which, in the\\r\\nestimation of some already biased minds, might be considered as indirectly\\r\\nsubstantiated by what has been said of the Frenchman\\'s two whales. Elsewhere in\\r\\nthis volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of\\r\\nwhaling is throughout a slatternly, untidy business. But there is another thing\\r\\nto rebut. They hint that all whales always smell bad. Now how did this odious\\r\\nstigma originate?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the Greenland\\r\\nwhaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because those whalemen\\r\\ndid not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea as the Southern ships\\r\\nhave always done; but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it\\r\\nthrough the bung holes of large casks, and carry it home in that manner; the\\r\\nshortness of the season in those Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to\\r\\nwhich they are exposed, forbidding any other course. The consequence is, that\\r\\nupon breaking into the hold, and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in\\r\\nthe Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising\\r\\nfrom excavating an old city graveyard, for the foundations of a Lying-in\\r\\nHospital.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise\\r\\nimputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former times, of a Dutch\\r\\nvillage called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which latter name is the one used\\r\\nby the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great work on Smells, a text-book on that\\r\\nsubject. As its name imports (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was\\r\\nfounded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to\\r\\nbe tried out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a\\r\\ncollection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works were in\\r\\nfull operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But all this is\\r\\nquite different from a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years\\r\\nperhaps, after completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps, consume\\r\\nfifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that it is casked,\\r\\nthe oil is nearly scentless. The truth is, that living or dead, if but decently\\r\\ntreated, whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor; nor can\\r\\nwhalemen be recognised, as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a\\r\\nJew in the company, by the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise\\r\\nthan fragrant, when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking\\r\\nabundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true, seldom in the\\r\\nopen air. I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale\\'s flukes above water\\r\\ndispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a warm\\r\\nparlor. What then shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering\\r\\nhis magnitude? Must it not be to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and\\r\\nredolent with myrrh, which was led out of an Indian town to do honor to\\r\\nAlexander the Great?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 93</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Castaway\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a most\\r\\nsignificant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod\\'s crew; an event\\r\\nmost lamentable; and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and\\r\\npredestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever\\r\\nshattered sequel might prove her own.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats. Some few\\r\\nhands are reserved called shipkeepers, whose province it is to work the vessel\\r\\nwhile the boats are pursuing the whale. As a general thing, these shipkeepers\\r\\nare as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats\\' crews. But if there\\r\\nhappen to be an unduly slender, clumsy, or timorous wight in the ship, that\\r\\nwight is certain to be made a ship-keeper. It was so in the Pequod with the\\r\\nlittle negro Pippin by nick-name, Pip by abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard\\r\\nof him before; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so\\r\\ngloomy-jolly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and a white\\r\\none, of equal developments, though of dissimilar color, driven in one eccentric\\r\\nspan. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull and torpid in his\\r\\nintellects, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at bottom very bright, with\\r\\nthat pleasant, genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which\\r\\never enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer, freer relish than any other\\r\\nrace. For blacks, the year\\'s calendar should show naught but three hundred and\\r\\nsixty-five Fourth of Julys and New Year\\'s Days. Nor smile so, while I write\\r\\nthat this little black was brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy;\\r\\nbehold yon lustrous ebony, panelled in king\\'s cabinets. But Pip loved life, and\\r\\nall life\\'s peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking business in which\\r\\nhe had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had most sadly blurred his\\r\\nbrightness; though, as ere long will be seen, what was thus temporarily subdued\\r\\nin him, in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fires,\\r\\nthat fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural lustre with which in\\r\\nhis native Tolland County in Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a\\r\\nfiddler\\'s frolic on the green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha!\\r\\nhad turned the round horizon into one star-belled tambourine. So, though in the\\r\\nclear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the pure-watered\\r\\ndiamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning jeweller would show you\\r\\nthe diamond in its most impressive lustre, he lays it against a gloomy ground,\\r\\nand then lights it up, not by the sun, but by some unnatural gases. Then come\\r\\nout those fiery effulgences, infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond,\\r\\nonce the divinest symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel\\r\\nstolen from the King of Hell. But let us to the story.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb\\'s after-oarsman chanced so\\r\\nto sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed; and, temporarily, Pip\\r\\nwas put into his place.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness; but\\r\\nhappily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and therefore\\r\\ncame off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing him, took care,\\r\\nafterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost, for he\\r\\nmight often find it needful.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as the fish\\r\\nreceived the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which happened, in this\\r\\ninstance, to be right under poor Pip\\'s seat. The involuntary consternation of\\r\\nthe moment caused him to leap, paddle in hand, out of the boat; and in such a\\r\\nway, that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest, he breasted it\\r\\noverboard with him, so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into\\r\\nthe water. That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line\\r\\nswiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of\\r\\nthe boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken several\\r\\nturns around his chest and neck.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He hated Pip\\r\\nfor a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath, he suspended its\\r\\nsharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb, exclaimed interrogatively,\\r\\n\"Cut?\" Meantime Pip\\'s blue, choked face plainly looked, Do, for God\\'s sake! All\\r\\npassed in a flash. In less than half a minute, this entire thing happened.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Damn him, cut!\" roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was saved.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by yells\\r\\nand execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings\\r\\nto evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like, but still half humorous\\r\\nmanner, cursed Pip officially; and that done, unofficially gave him much\\r\\nwholesome advice. The substance was, Never jump from a boat, Pip, except\\xe2\\x80\\x94but\\r\\nall the rest was indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is. Now, in general,\\r\\nStick to the boat, is your true motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes\\r\\nhappen when Leap from the boat, is still better. Moreover, as if perceiving at\\r\\nlast that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be\\r\\nleaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped\\r\\nall advice, and concluded with a peremptory command \"Stick to the boat, Pip, or\\r\\nby the Lord, I won\\'t pick you up if you jump; mind that. We can\\'t afford to\\r\\nlose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for thirty times what you\\r\\nwould, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in mind, and don\\'t jump any more.\" Hereby\\r\\nperhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that though man loved his fellow, yet man is a\\r\\nmoney-making animal, which propensity too often interferes with his\\r\\nbenevolence.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was under\\r\\nvery similar circumstances to the first performance; but this time he did not\\r\\nbreast out the line; and hence, when the whale started to run, Pip was left\\r\\nbehind on the sea, like a hurried traveller\\'s trunk. Alas! Stubb was but too\\r\\ntrue to his word. It was a beautiful, bounteous, blue day! the spangled sea\\r\\ncalm and cool, and flatly stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like\\r\\ngold-beater\\'s skin hammered out to the extremest. Bobbing up and down in that\\r\\nsea, Pip\\'s ebon head showed like a head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted\\r\\nwhen he fell so rapidly astern. Stubb\\'s inexorable back was turned upon him;\\r\\nand the whale was winged. In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was\\r\\nbetween Pip and Stubb. Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his\\r\\ncrisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though the\\r\\nloftiest and the brightest.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practised\\r\\nswimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful lonesomeness is\\r\\nintolerable. The intense concentration of self in the middle of such a\\r\\nheartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark, how when sailors in a dead\\r\\ncalm bathe in the open sea\\xe2\\x80\\x94 mark how closely they hug their ship and only coast\\r\\nalong her sides.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No; he did\\r\\nnot mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake, and he\\r\\nsupposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip very quickly, and\\r\\npick him up; though, indeed, such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized\\r\\nthrough their own timidity, is not always manifested by the hunters in all\\r\\nsimilar instances; and such instances not unfrequently occur; almost invariably\\r\\nin the fishery, a coward, so called, is marked with the same ruthless\\r\\ndetestation peculiar to military navies and armies.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly spying\\r\\nwhales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and Stubb\\'s boat was\\r\\nnow so far away, and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish, that Pip\\'s\\r\\nringed horizon began to expand around him miserably. By the merest chance the\\r\\nship itself at last rescued him; but from that hour the little negro went about\\r\\nthe deck an idiot; such, at least, they said he was. The sea had jeeringly kept\\r\\nhis finite body up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely,\\r\\nthough. Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of\\r\\nthe unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes; and the\\r\\nmiser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the joyous,\\r\\nheartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous,\\r\\nGod-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the firmament of waters heaved the\\r\\ncolossal orbs. He saw God\\'s foot upon the treadle of the loom, and spoke it;\\r\\nand therefore his shipmates called him mad. So man\\'s insanity is heaven\\'s\\r\\nsense; and wandering from all mortal reason, man comes at last to that\\r\\ncelestial thought, which, to reason, is absurd and frantic; and weal or woe,\\r\\nfeels then uncompromised, indifferent as his God.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor the rest blame not Stubb too hardly. The thing is common in that fishery;\\r\\nand in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen what like abandonment\\r\\nbefell myself.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 94</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA Squeeze of the Hand\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThat whale of Stubb\\'s, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to the Pequod\\'s\\r\\nside, where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously detailed, were\\r\\nregularly gone through, even to the baling of the Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhile some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed in\\r\\ndragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm; and when the\\r\\nproper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere going to the\\r\\ntry-works, of which anon.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with several\\r\\nothers, I sat down before a large Constantine\\'s bath of it, I found it\\r\\nstrangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling about in the liquid\\r\\npart. It was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid. A sweet and\\r\\nunctuous duty! No wonder that in old times this sperm was such a favorite\\r\\ncosmetic. Such a clearer! such a sweetener! such a softener; such a delicious\\r\\nmollifier! After having my hands in it for only a few minutes, my fingers felt\\r\\nlike eels, and began, as it were, to serpentine and spiralize.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter exertion\\r\\nat the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under indolent sail, and\\r\\ngliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands among those soft, gentle\\r\\nglobules of infiltrated tissues, woven almost within the hour; as they richly\\r\\nbroke to my fingers, and discharged all their opulence, like fully ripe grapes\\r\\ntheir wine; as. I snuffed up that uncontaminated aroma,\\xe2\\x80\\x94 literally and truly,\\r\\nlike the smell of spring violets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived\\r\\nas in a musky meadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that\\r\\ninexpressible sperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it; I almost began to\\r\\ncredit the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying\\r\\nthe heat of anger; while bathing in that bath, I felt divinely free from all\\r\\nill-will, or petulance, or malice, of any sort whatsoever.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSqueeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm till I\\r\\nmyself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of\\r\\ninsanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly squeezing my co-laborers\\'\\r\\nhands in it, mistaking their hands for the gentle globules. Such an abounding,\\r\\naffectionate, friendly, loving feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I\\r\\nwas continually squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes\\r\\nsentimentally; as much as to say,\\xe2\\x80\\x94Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we\\r\\nlonger cherish any social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy!\\r\\nCome; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into\\r\\neach other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm\\r\\nof kindness.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWould that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since by many\\r\\nprolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that in all cases man must\\r\\neventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of attainable felicity; not\\r\\nplacing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy; but in the wife, the heart,\\r\\nthe bed, the table, the saddle, the fire-side; the country; now that I have\\r\\nperceived all this, I am ready to squeeze case eternally. In thoughts of the\\r\\nvisions of the night, I saw long rows of angels in paradise, each with his\\r\\nhands in a jar of spermaceti.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, while discoursing of sperm it behooves to speak of other things akin to\\r\\nit, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the try-works.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFirst comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering part of\\r\\nthe fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes. It is tough with\\r\\ncongealed tendons\\xe2\\x80\\x94a wad of muscle\\xe2\\x80\\x94but still contains some oil. After being\\r\\nsevered from the whale, the white-horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere\\r\\ngoing to the mincer. They look much like blocks of Berkshire marble.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPlum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the whale\\'s\\r\\nflesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and often\\r\\nparticipating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is a most\\r\\nrefreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name imports, it is\\r\\nof an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked snowy and golden\\r\\nground, dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and purple. It is plums of\\r\\nrubies, in pictures of citron. Spite of reason, it is hard to keep yourself\\r\\nfrom eating it. I confess, that once I stole behind the foremast to try it. It\\r\\ntasted something as I should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis le\\r\\nGros might have tasted, supposing him to have been killed the first day after\\r\\nthe venison season, and that particular venison season contemporary with an\\r\\nunusually fine vintage of the vineyards of Champagne.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in the\\r\\ncourse of this business, but which I feel it to be very puzzling adequately to\\r\\ndescribe. It is called slobgollion; an appellation original with the whalemen,\\r\\nand even so is the nature of the substance. It is an ineffably oozy, stringy\\r\\naffair, most frequently found in the tubs of sperm, after a prolonged\\r\\nsqueezing, and subsequent decanting. I hold it to be the wondrously thin,\\r\\nruptured membranes of the case, coalescing.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nGurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but sometimes\\r\\nincidentally used by the sperm fishermen. It designates the dark, glutinous\\r\\nsubstance which is scraped off the back of the Greenland or right whale, and\\r\\nmuch of which covers the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble\\r\\nLeviathan.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale\\'s vocabulary. But as\\r\\napplied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whaleman\\'s nipper is a short firm strip\\r\\nof tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathan\\'s tail: it averages\\r\\nan inch in thickness, and for the rest, is about the size of the iron part of a\\r\\nhoe. Edgewise moved along the oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee;\\r\\nand by nameless blandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all\\r\\nimpurities.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at once to\\r\\ndescend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its inmates. This\\r\\nplace has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the blanket-pieces,\\r\\nwhen stript and hoisted from the whale. When the proper time arrives for\\r\\ncutting up its contents, this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros,\\r\\nespecially by night. On one side, lit by a dull lantern, a space has been left\\r\\nclear for the workmen. They generally go in pairs,\\xe2\\x80\\x94a pike-and-gaffman and a\\r\\nspade-man. The whaling-pike is similar to a frigate\\'s boarding-weapon of the\\r\\nsame name. The gaff is something like a boat-hook. With his gaff, the gaffman\\r\\nhooks on to a sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it from slipping, as the\\r\\nship pitches and lurches about. Meanwhile, the spade-man stands on the sheet\\r\\nitself, perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse-pieces. This spade\\r\\nis sharp as hone can make it; the spademan\\'s feet are shoeless; the thing he\\r\\nstands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge. If he\\r\\ncuts off one of his own toes, or one of his assistants\\', would you be very much\\r\\nastonished? Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room men.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 95</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Cassock\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHad you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this\\r\\npost-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward nigh the windlass,\\r\\npretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small curiosity a very\\r\\nstrange, enigmatical object, which you would have seen there, lying along\\r\\nlengthwise in the lee scuppers. Not the wondrous cistern in the whale\\'s huge\\r\\nhead; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw; not the miracle of his\\r\\nsymmetrical tail; none of these would so surprise you, as half a glimpse of\\r\\nthat unaccountable cone,\\xe2\\x80\\x94longer than a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in\\r\\ndiameter at the base, and jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg.

Extending it upon the forecastle deck, he now proceeds\\r\\ncylindrically to remove its dark pelt, as an African hunter the pelt of a boa.\\r\\nThis done he turns the pelt inside out, like a pantaloon leg; gives it a good\\r\\nstretching, so as almost to double its diameter; and at last hangs it, well\\r\\nspread, in the rigging, to dry. Ere long, it is taken down; when removing some\\r\\nthree feet of it, towards the pointed extremity, and then cutting two slits for\\r\\narm-holes at the other end, he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it. The\\r\\nmincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling.\\r\\nImmemorial to all his order, this investiture alone will adequately protect\\r\\nhim, while employed in the peculiar functions of his office.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThat office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the pots; an\\r\\noperation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse, planted endwise against\\r\\nthe bulwarks, and with a capacious tub beneath it, into which the minced pieces\\r\\ndrop, fast as the sheets from a rapt orator\\'s desk.

It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work into as thin slices as\\r\\npossible, inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much\\r\\naccelerated, and its quantity considerably increased, besides perhaps improving\\r\\nit in quality.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 96</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Try-Works\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBesides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly distinguished by her\\r\\ntry-works.

It is as if from the open\\r\\nfield a brick-kiln were transported to her planks.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the most roomy\\r\\npart of the deck. The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength, fitted to\\r\\nsustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar, some ten feet\\r\\nby eight square, and five in height. The foundation does not penetrate the\\r\\ndeck, but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of\\r\\niron bracing it on all sides, and screwing it down to the timbers. On the\\r\\nflanks it is cased with wood, and at top completely covered by a large,\\r\\nsloping, battened hatchway. Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots,\\r\\ntwo in number, and each of several barrels\\' capacity. When not in use, they are\\r\\nkept remarkably clean. Sometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand,\\r\\ntill they shine within like silver punchbowls. During the night-watches some\\r\\ncynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a\\r\\nnap. While employed in polishing them\\xe2\\x80\\x94one man in each pot, side by side\\xe2\\x80\\x94 many\\r\\nconfidential communications are carried on, over the iron lips. It is a place\\r\\nalso for profound mathematical meditation. It was in the left hand try-pot of\\r\\nthe Pequod, with the soapstone diligently circling round me, that I was first\\r\\nindirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies gliding\\r\\nalong the cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from any point in\\r\\nprecisely the same time.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nRemoving the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare masonry of\\r\\nthat side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of the furnaces,\\r\\ndirectly underneath the pots. These mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron.\\r\\nThe intense heat of the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the\\r\\ndeck, by means of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire inclosed\\r\\nsurface of the works. By a tunnel inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept\\r\\nreplenished with water as fast as it evaporates. There are no external\\r\\nchimneys; they open direct from the rear wall. And here let us go back for a\\r\\nmoment.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was about nine o\\'clock at night that the Pequod\\'s try-works were first\\r\\nstarted on this present voyage. It belonged to Stubb to oversee the business.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"All ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the works.\"\\r\\nThis was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting his shavings into\\r\\nthe furnace throughout the passage. Here be it said that in a whaling voyage\\r\\nthe first fire in the try-works has to be fed for a time with wood. After that\\r\\nno wood is used, except as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel. In a\\r\\nword, after being tried out, the crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps\\r\\nor fritters, still contains considerable of its unctuous properties. These\\r\\nfritters feed the flames. Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming\\r\\nmisanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own\\r\\nbody. Would that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is horrible to\\r\\ninhale, and inhale it you must, and not only that, but you must live in it for\\r\\nthe time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor about it, such as may lurk\\r\\nin the vicinity of funereal pyres. It smells like the left wing of the day of\\r\\njudgment; it is an argument for the pit.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy midnight the works were in full operation. We were clear from the carcass;\\r\\nsail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean darkness was\\r\\nintense. But that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames, which at\\r\\nintervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and illuminated every lofty rope\\r\\nin the rigging, as with the famed Greek fire. The burning ship drove on, as if\\r\\nremorselessly commissioned to some vengeful deed. So the pitch and\\r\\nsulphur-freighted brigs of the bold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their\\r\\nmidnight harbors, with broad sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the\\r\\nTurkish frigates, and folded them in conflagrations.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide hearth in\\r\\nfront of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the pagan\\r\\nharpooneers, always the whale-ship\\'s stokers. With huge pronged poles they\\r\\npitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots, or stirred up the\\r\\nfires beneath, till the snaky flames darted, curling, out of the doors to catch\\r\\nthem by the feet. The smoke rolled away in sullen heaps. To every pitch of the\\r\\nship there was a pitch of the boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap\\r\\ninto their faces. Opposite the mouth of the works, on the further side of the\\r\\nwide wooden hearth, was the windlass. This served for a sea-sofa. Here lounged\\r\\nthe watch, when not otherwise employed, looking into the red heat of the fire,\\r\\ntill their eyes felt scorched in their heads. Their tawny features, now all\\r\\nbegrimed with smoke and sweat, their matted beards, and the contrasting\\r\\nbarbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all these were strangely revealed in the\\r\\ncapricious emblazonings of the works. As they narrated to each other their\\r\\nunholy adventures, their tales of terror told in words of mirth; as their\\r\\nuncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them, like the flames from the\\r\\nfurnace; as to and fro, in their front, the harpooneers wildly gesticulated\\r\\nwith their huge pronged forks and dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea\\r\\nleaped, and the ship groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell\\r\\nfurther and further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully\\r\\nchamped the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on all sides;\\r\\nthen the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden with fire, and\\r\\nburning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of darkness, seemed the\\r\\nmaterial counterpart of her monomaniac commander\\'s soul.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours silently guided\\r\\nthe way of this fire-ship on the sea. Wrapped, for that interval, in darkness\\r\\nmyself, I but the better saw the redness, the madness, the ghastliness of\\r\\nothers. The continual sight of the fiend shapes before me, capering half in\\r\\nsmoke and half in fire, these at last begat kindred visions in my soul, so soon\\r\\nas I began to yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over\\r\\nme at a midnight helm.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable) thing\\r\\noccurred to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was horribly conscious\\r\\nof something fatally wrong. The jaw-bone tiller smote my side, which leaned\\r\\nagainst it; in my ears was the low hum of sails, just beginning to shake in the\\r\\nwind; I thought my eyes were open; I was half conscious of putting my fingers\\r\\nto the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart. But, spite of\\r\\nall this, I could see no compass before me to steer by; though it seemed but a\\r\\nminute since I had been watching the card, by the steady binnacle lamp\\r\\nilluminating it. Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and then made\\r\\nghastly by flashes of redness. Uppermost was the impression, that whatever\\r\\nswift, rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as\\r\\nrushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered feeling, as of death, came\\r\\nover me. Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with the crazy conceit\\r\\nthat the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted way, inverted. My God! what is\\r\\nthe matter with me? thought I. Lo! in my brief sleep I had turned myself about,\\r\\nand was fronting the ship\\'s stern, with my back to her prow and the compass. In\\r\\nan instant I faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into\\r\\nthe wind, and very probably capsizing her. How glad and how grateful the relief\\r\\nfrom this unnatural hallucination of the night, and the fatal contingency of\\r\\nbeing brought by the lee!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLook not too long in the face of the fire, O man! Never dream with thy hand on\\r\\nthe helm! Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the first hint of the\\r\\nhitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its redness makes all\\r\\nthings look ghastly. To-morrow, in the natural sun, the skies will be bright;\\r\\nthose who glared like devils in the forking flames, the morn will show in far\\r\\nother, at least gentler, relief; the glorious, golden, glad sun, the only true\\r\\nlamp\\xe2\\x80\\x94all others but liars!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNevertheless the sun hides not Virginia\\'s Dismal Swamp, nor Rome\\'s accursed\\r\\nCampagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of deserts and of\\r\\ngriefs beneath the moon. The sun hides not the ocean, which is the dark side of\\r\\nthis earth, and which is two thirds of this earth. So, therefore, that mortal\\r\\nman who hath more of joy than sorrow in him, that mortal man cannot be true\\xe2\\x80\\x94not\\r\\ntrue, or undeveloped. With books the same. The truest of all men was the Man of\\r\\nSorrows, and the truest of all books is Solomon\\'s, and Ecclesiastes is the fine\\r\\nhammered steel of woe. \"All is vanity.\" ALL. This wilful world hath not got\\r\\nhold of unchristian Solomon\\'s wisdom yet. But he who dodges hospitals and\\r\\njails, and walks fast crossing graveyards, and would rather talk of operas than\\r\\nhell; calls Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils all of sick men; and\\r\\nthroughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais as passing wise, and\\r\\ntherefore jolly;\\xe2\\x80\\x94not that man is fitted to sit down on tomb-stones, and break\\r\\nthe green damp mould with unfathomably wondrous Solomon.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut even Solomon, he says, \"the man that wandereth out of the way of\\r\\nunderstanding shall remain\" (i.e. even while living) \"in the congregation of\\r\\nthe dead.\" Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest it invert thee, deaden\\r\\nthee; as for the time it did me. There is a wisdom that is woe; but there is a\\r\\nwoe that is madness. And there is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike\\r\\ndive down into the blackest gorges, and soar out of them again and become\\r\\ninvisible in the sunny spaces. And even if he for ever flies within the gorge,\\r\\nthat gorge is in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain\\r\\neagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 97</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Lamp\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHad you descended from the Pequod\\'s try-works to the Pequod\\'s forecastle, where\\r\\nthe off duty watch were sleeping, for one single moment you would have almost\\r\\nthought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized kings and\\r\\ncounsellors.

This done, the hatches are replaced, and\\r\\nhermetically closed, like a closet walled up.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incidents in\\r\\nall the business of whaling. One day the planks stream with freshets of blood\\r\\nand oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous masses of the whale\\'s head are\\r\\nprofanely piled; great rusty casks lie about, as in a brewery yard; the smoke\\r\\nfrom the try-works has besooted all the bulwarks; the mariners go about\\r\\nsuffused with unctuousness; the entire ship seems great leviathan himself;\\r\\nwhile on all hands the din is deafening.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this\\r\\nself-same ship! and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works, you\\r\\nwould all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a most\\r\\nscrupulously neat commander. The unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a\\r\\nsingularly cleansing virtue. This is the reason why the decks never look so\\r\\nwhite as just after what they call an affair of oil. Besides, from the ashes of\\r\\nthe burned scraps of the whale, a potent lye is readily made; and whenever any\\r\\nadhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side, that lye\\r\\nquickly exterminates it. Hands go diligently along the bulwarks, and with\\r\\nbuckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness. The soot is\\r\\nbrushed from the lower rigging. All the numerous implements which have been in\\r\\nuse are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away. The great hatch is scrubbed\\r\\nand placed upon the try-works, completely hiding the pots; every cask is out of\\r\\nsight; all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the combined and,\\r\\nsimultaneous industry of almost the entire ship\\'s company, the whole of this\\r\\nconscientious duty is at last concluded, then the crew themselves proceed to\\r\\ntheir own ablutions; shift themselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the\\r\\nimmaculate deck, fresh and all aglow as bridegrooms new-leaped from out the\\r\\ndaintiest Holland.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and humorously\\r\\ndiscourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics; propose to mat the\\r\\ndeck; think of having hangings to the top; object not to taking tea by\\r\\nmoonlight on the piazza of the forecastle. To hint to such musked mariners of\\r\\noil, and bone, and blubber, were little short of audacity. They know not the\\r\\nthing you distantly allude to. Away, and bring us napkins!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three men intent on\\r\\nspying out more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will again soil the old\\r\\noaken furniture, and drop at least one small grease-spot somewhere. Yes; and\\r\\nmany is the time, when, after the severest uninterrupted labors, which know no\\r\\nnight; continuing straight through for ninety-six hours; when from the boat,\\r\\nwhere they have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the Line,\\xe2\\x80\\x94they only\\r\\nstep to the deck to carry vast chains, and heave the heavy windlass, and cut\\r\\nand slash, yea, and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the\\r\\ncombined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works; when, on the\\r\\nheel of all this, they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship,\\r\\nand make a spotless dairy room of it; many is the time the poor fellows, just\\r\\nbuttoning the necks of their clean frocks, are startled by the cry of \"There\\r\\nshe blows!\" and away they fly to fight another whale, and go through the whole\\r\\nweary thing again. Oh! my friends, but this is man-killing! Yet this is life.\\r\\nFor hardly have we mortals by long toilings extracted from this world\\'s vast\\r\\nbulk its small but valuable sperm; and then, with weary patience, cleansed\\r\\nourselves from its defilements, and learned to live here in clean tabernacles\\r\\nof the soul; hardly is this done, when\\xe2\\x80\\x94There she blows!\\xe2\\x80\\x94the ghost is spouted\\r\\nup, and away we sail to fight some other world, and go through young life\\'s old\\r\\nroutine again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOh! the metempsychosis!

When he halted before the binnacle, with his glance fastened on the\\r\\npointed needle in the compass, that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed\\r\\nintensity of his purpose; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the\\r\\nmainmast, then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin\\r\\nthere, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed with a\\r\\ncertain wild longing, if not hopefulness.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly attracted\\r\\nby the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as though now for the\\r\\nfirst time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever\\r\\nsignificance might lurk in them. And some certain significance lurks in all\\r\\nthings, else all things are little worth, and the round world itself but an\\r\\nempty cipher, except to sell by the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to\\r\\nfill up some morass in the Milky Way.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of the heart\\r\\nof gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands, the head-waters of\\r\\nmany a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron\\r\\nbolts and the verdigris of copper spikes, yet, untouchable and immaculate to\\r\\nany foulness, it still preserved its Quito glow. Nor, though placed amongst a\\r\\nruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands, and through the livelong\\r\\nnights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach,\\r\\nnevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset last left it\\r\\nlast. For it was set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however\\r\\nwanton in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as the white\\r\\nwhale\\'s talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night,\\r\\nwondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever live to spend\\r\\nit.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun and\\r\\ntropic token-pieces. Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes; sun\\'s disks and stars,\\r\\necliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving, are in luxuriant profusion\\r\\nstamped; so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness\\r\\nand enhancing glories, by passing through those fancy mints, so Spanishly\\r\\npoetic.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example of\\r\\nthese things. On its round border it bore the letters, REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR:\\r\\nQUITO. So this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the\\r\\nworld, and beneath the great equator, and named after it; and it had been cast\\r\\nmidway up the Andes, in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn. Zoned by those\\r\\nletters you saw the likeness of three Andes\\' summits; from one a flame; a tower\\r\\non another; on the third a crowing cock; while arching over all was a segment\\r\\nof the partitioned zodiac, the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics,\\r\\nand the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at Libra.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBefore this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now pausing.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"There\\'s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and all other\\r\\ngrand and lofty things; look here,\\xe2\\x80\\x94 three peaks as proud as Lucifer.

Great pains, small\\r\\ngains for those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself.\\r\\nMethinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the\\r\\nsign of storms, the equinox! and but six months before he wheeled out of a\\r\\nformer equinox at Aries!

If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows her mouldy soil; but\\r\\nif we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance half way, to cheer. Yet, oh,\\r\\nthe great sun is no fixture; and if, at midnight, we would fain snatch some\\r\\nsweet solace from him, we gaze for him in vain!

Pity if there is nothing\\r\\nwonderful in signs, and significant in wonders! There\\'s a clue somewhere; wait\\r\\na bit; hist\\xe2\\x80\\x94hark! By Jove, I have it! Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is\\r\\nthe life of man in one round chapter; and now I\\'ll read it off, straight out of\\r\\nthe book. Come, Almanack! To begin: there\\'s Aries, or the Ram\\xe2\\x80\\x94 lecherous dog,\\r\\nhe begets us; then, Taurus, or the Bull\\xe2\\x80\\x94 he bumps us the first thing; then\\r\\nGemini, or the Twins\\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when\\r\\nlo! comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue, Leo,\\r\\na roaring Lion, lies in the path\\xe2\\x80\\x94 he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs\\r\\nwith his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! that\\'s our first love; we\\r\\nmarry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes Libra, or the\\r\\nScales\\xe2\\x80\\x94happiness weighed and found wanting; and while we are very sad about\\r\\nthat, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio, or the Scorpion, stings us in the\\r\\nrear; we are curing the wound, when whang comes the arrows all round;\\r\\nSagittarius, or the Archer, is amusing himself. As we pluck out the shafts,\\r\\nstand aside! here\\'s the battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he\\r\\ncomes rushing, and headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Waterbearer,\\r\\npours out his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the\\r\\nFishes, we sleep. There\\'s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the sun goes\\r\\nthrough it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty. Jollily\\r\\nhe, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and so, alow here, does jolly\\r\\nStubb. Oh, jolly\\'s the word for aye! Adieu, Doubloon! But stop; here comes\\r\\nlittle King-Post; dodge round the try-works, now, and let\\'s hear what he\\'ll\\r\\nhave to say. There; he\\'s before it; he\\'ll out with something presently. So, so;\\r\\nhe\\'s beginning.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever raises a\\r\\ncertain whale, this round thing belongs to him. So, what\\'s all this staring\\r\\nbeen about? It is worth sixteen dollars, that\\'s true; and at two cents the\\r\\ncigar, that\\'s nine hundred and sixty cigars. I won\\'t smoke dirty pipes like\\r\\nStubb, but I like cigars, and here\\'s nine hundred and sixty of them; so here\\r\\ngoes Flask aloft to spy \\'em out.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Shall I call that Wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has a foolish\\r\\nlook to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort of wiseish look to\\r\\nit.

He luffs up before the doubloon;\\r\\nhalloa, and goes round on the other side of the mast; why, there\\'s a horse-shoe\\r\\nnailed on that side; and now he\\'s back again; what does that mean?

I\\'ve studied signs, and know their marks;\\r\\nthey were taught me two score years ago, by the old witch in Copenhagen. Now,\\r\\nin what sign will the sun then be? The horse-shoe sign; for there it is, right\\r\\nopposite the gold. And what\\'s the horse-shoe sign? The lion is the horse-shoe\\r\\nsign\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the roaring and devouring lion.

As I live he\\'s\\r\\ncomparing notes; looking at his thigh bone; thinks the sun is in the thigh, or\\r\\nin the calf, or in the bowels, I suppose, as the old women talk Surgeon\\'s\\r\\nAstronomy in the back country. And by Jove, he\\'s found something there in the\\r\\nvicinity of his thigh\\xe2\\x80\\x94 I guess it\\'s Sagittarius, or the Archer. No: he don\\'t\\r\\nknow what to make of the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off some\\r\\nking\\'s trowsers.

Hast seen the White Whale?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colors, bearing down\\r\\nunder the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was standing in his hoisted\\r\\nquarter-deck, his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain, who was\\r\\ncarelessly reclining in his own boat\\'s bow. He was a darkly-tanned, burly,\\r\\ngoodnatured, fine-looking man, of sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious\\r\\nroundabout, that hung round him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty\\r\\narm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a huzzar\\'s\\r\\nsurcoat.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Hast seen the White Whale!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"See you this?\" and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it, he held\\r\\nup a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden head like a mallet.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Man my boat!\" cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars near\\r\\nhim\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Stand by to lower!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his crew were\\r\\ndropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the stranger. But here a\\r\\ncurious difficulty presented itself. In the excitement of the moment, Ahab had\\r\\nforgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of\\r\\nany vessel at sea but his own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very\\r\\nhandy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be\\r\\nrigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment\\'s warning. Now, it is no\\r\\nvery easy matter for anybody\\xe2\\x80\\x94 except those who are almost hourly used to it,\\r\\nlike whalemen\\xe2\\x80\\x94 to clamber up a ship\\'s side from a boat on the open sea; for the\\r\\ngreat swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks, and then\\r\\ninstantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson. So, deprived of one leg,\\r\\nand the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly\\r\\ninvention, Ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again;\\r\\nhopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to\\r\\nattain.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward circumstance\\r\\nthat befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap, almost\\r\\ninvariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And in the present instance, all this\\r\\nwas heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship, leaning\\r\\nover the side, by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging\\r\\ntowards him a pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did\\r\\nnot seem to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to\\r\\nuse their sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute, because\\r\\nthe strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood, cried out, \"I\\r\\nsee, I see!\\xe2\\x80\\x94 avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing over the\\r\\ncutting-tackle.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two\\r\\nprevious, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive curved\\r\\nblubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end. This was\\r\\nquickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all, slid his solitary\\r\\nthigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting in the fluke of an\\r\\nanchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then giving the word, held himself\\r\\nfast, and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight, by pulling\\r\\nhand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of the tackle. Soon he was\\r\\ncarefully swung inside the high bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan\\r\\nhead. With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain\\r\\nadvanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like\\r\\ntwo sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, \"Aye, aye, hearty! let us\\r\\nshake bones together!\\xe2\\x80\\x94an arm and a leg!\\xe2\\x80\\x94 an arm that never can shrink, d\\'ye\\r\\nsee; and a leg that never can run. Where did\\'st thou see the White Whale?\\xe2\\x80\\x94how\\r\\nlong ago?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"The White Whale,\" said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm towards the\\r\\nEast, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a telescope; There\\r\\nI saw him, on the Line, last season.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"And he took that arm off, did he?\" asked Ahab, now sliding down from the\\r\\ncapstan, and resting on the Englishman\\'s shoulder, as he did so.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Spin me the yarn,\" said Ahab; \"how was it?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,\" began the\\r\\nEnglishman. \"I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time. Well, one day we\\r\\nlowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat fastened to one of them;\\r\\na regular circus horse he was, too, that went milling and milling round so that\\r\\nmy boat\\'s crew could only trim dish, by sitting all their sterns on the outer\\r\\ngunwale. Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great\\r\\nwhale, with a milky-white head and hump, all crows\\' feet and wrinkles.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"It was he, it was he!\" cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended breath.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin. Aye, aye\\xe2\\x80\\x94 they were mine\\xe2\\x80\\x94my\\r\\nirons,\" cried Ahab, exultingly\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"but on!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Give me a chance, then,\" said the Englishman, good-humoredly. \"Well, this old\\r\\ngreat-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all afoam into the pod,\\r\\nand goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Aye, I see!\\xe2\\x80\\x94wanted to part it; free the fast-fish\\xe2\\x80\\x94an old trick\\xe2\\x80\\x94<br>\\r\\nI know him.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"How it was exactly,\" continued the one-armed commander, \"I do not know; but in\\r\\nbiting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there somehow; but we didn\\'t\\r\\nknow it then; so that when we afterwards pulled on the line, bounce we came\\r\\nplump on to his hump! instead of the other whale\\'s; that went off to windward,\\r\\nall fluking. Seeing how matters stood, and what a noble great whale it was\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the\\r\\nnoblest and biggest I ever saw, sir, in my life\\xe2\\x80\\x94I resolved to capture him,\\r\\nspite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line\\r\\nwould get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a devil\\r\\nof a boat\\'s crew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I say, I jumped\\r\\ninto my first mate\\'s boat\\xe2\\x80\\x94Mr. Mounttop\\'s here (by the way, Captain\\xe2\\x80\\x94Mounttop;\\r\\nMounttop\\xe2\\x80\\x94the captain);\\xe2\\x80\\x94 as I was saying, I jumped into Mounttop\\'s boat, which,\\r\\nd\\'ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with mine, then; and snatching the first\\r\\nharpoon, let this old great-grandfather have it. But, Lord, look you,\\r\\nsir\\xe2\\x80\\x94hearts and souls alive, man\\xe2\\x80\\x94the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a\\r\\nbat\\xe2\\x80\\x94both eyes out\\xe2\\x80\\x94all befogged and bedeadened with black foam\\xe2\\x80\\x94the whale\\'s tail\\r\\nlooming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble steeple.\\r\\nNo use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday, with a blinding sun,\\r\\nall crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after the second iron, to toss it\\r\\noverboard\\xe2\\x80\\x94down comes the tail like a Lima tower, cutting my boat in two,\\r\\nleaving each half in splinters; and, flukes first, the white hump backed\\r\\nthrough the wreck, as though it was all chips. We all struck out. To escape his\\r\\nterrible flailings, I seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a\\r\\nmoment clung to that like a sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and\\r\\nat the same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down like a\\r\\nflash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me\\r\\nhere\" (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); \"yes, caught me just here, I\\r\\nsay, and bore me down to Hell\\'s flames, I was thinking; when, when, all of a\\r\\nsudden, thank the good God, the barb ript its way along the flesh\\xe2\\x80\\x94 clear along\\r\\nthe whole length of my arm\\xe2\\x80\\x94came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;\\xe2\\x80\\x94and that\\r\\ngentleman there will tell you the rest (by the way, captain\\xe2\\x80\\x94Dr. Bunger, ship\\'s\\r\\nsurgeon: Bunger, my lad,\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the captain). Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the\\r\\nyarn.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all the time\\r\\nstanding near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote his gentlemanly\\r\\nrank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but sober one; he was dressed\\r\\nin a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and patched trowsers; and had thus far\\r\\nbeen dividing his attention between a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a\\r\\npill-box held in the other, occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory\\r\\nlimbs of the two crippled captains. But, at his superior\\'s introduction of him\\r\\nto Ahab, he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain\\'s\\r\\nbidding.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"It was a shocking bad wound,\" began the whale-surgeon; \"and, taking my advice,\\r\\nCaptain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy-\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship,\" interrupted the one-armed captain,\\r\\naddressing Ahab; \"go on, boy.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing hot\\r\\nweather there on the Line. But it was no use\\xe2\\x80\\x94I did all I could; sat up with him\\r\\nnights; was very severe with him in the matter of diet-\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Oh, very severe!\" chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly altering his\\r\\nvoice, \"Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night, till he couldn\\'t see to\\r\\nput on the bandages; and sending me to bed, half seas over, about three o\\'clock\\r\\nin the morning. Oh, ye stars! he sat up with me indeed, and was very severe in\\r\\nmy diet. Oh! a great watcher, and very dietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger.\\r\\n(Bunger, you dog, laugh out! why don\\'t ye?

I measured it with the lead line. In short, it grew black; I knew\\r\\nwhat was threatened, and off it came. But I had no hand in shipping that ivory\\r\\narm there; that thing is against all rule\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94 pointing at it with the\\r\\nmarlingspike\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"that is the captain\\'s work, not mine; he ordered the carpenter to\\r\\nmake it; he had that club-hammer there put to the end, to knock some one\\'s\\r\\nbrains out with, I suppose, as he tried mine once.

Do ye see this dent, sir\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94removing his hat, and brushing\\r\\naside his hair, and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore\\r\\nnot the slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever having been a wound\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\n\"Well, the captain there will tell you how that came there; he knows.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"No, I don\\'t,\" said the captain, \"but his mother did; he was born with it.

Well; after he sounded, we didn\\'t\\r\\nsee him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I didn\\'t then know\\r\\nwhat whale it was that had served me such a trick, till some time afterwards,\\r\\nwhen coming back to the Line, we heard about Moby Dick\\xe2\\x80\\x94as some call him\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\r\\nthen I knew it was he.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Did\\'st thou cross his wake again?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Twice.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"But could not fasten?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Didn\\'t want to try to; ain\\'t one limb enough? What should I do without this\\r\\nother arm? And I\\'m thinking Moby Dick doesn\\'t bite so much as he swallows.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Well, then,\" interrupted Bunger, \"give him your left arm for bait to get the\\r\\nright. Do you know, gentlemen\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94very gravely and mathematically bowing to each\\r\\nCaptain in succession\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Do you know, gentlemen, that the digestive organs of the\\r\\nwhale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine Providence, that it is quite\\r\\nimpossible for him to completely digest even a man\\'s arm? And he knows it too.\\r\\nSo that what you take for the White Whale\\'s malice is only his awkwardness. For\\r\\nhe never means to swallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints.\\r\\nBut sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of mine in\\r\\nCeylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a time let one drop\\r\\ninto him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more; when I\\r\\ngave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d\\'ye see? No possible\\r\\nway for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into his\\r\\ngeneral bodily system. Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick enough about it,\\r\\nand have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent\\r\\nburial to the other, why, in that case the arm is yours; only let the whale\\r\\nhave another chance at you shortly, that\\'s all.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"No, thank you, Bunger,\" said the English Captain, \"he\\'s welcome to the arm he\\r\\nhas, since I can\\'t help it, and didn\\'t know him then; but not to another one.\\r\\nNo more White Whales for me; I\\'ve lowered for him once, and that has satisfied\\r\\nme.

How long, prior to\\r\\nthe year of our Lord 1775, this great whaling house was in existence, my\\r\\nnumerous fish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted\\r\\nout the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale; though\\r\\nfor some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our valiant Coffins and\\r\\nMaceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets pursued the Leviathan,\\r\\nbut only in the North and South Atlantic: not elsewhere. Be it distinctly\\r\\nrecorded here, that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon\\r\\nwith civilized steel the great Sperm Whale; and that for half a century they\\r\\nwere the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose, and at\\r\\nthe sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape Horn, and was the\\r\\nfirst among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any sort in the great South\\r\\nSea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one; and returning to her berth with\\r\\nher hold full of the precious sperm, the Amelia\\'s example was soon followed by\\r\\nother ships, English and American, and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the\\r\\nPacific were thrown open. But not content with this good deed, the\\r\\nindefatigable house again bestirred itself: Samuel and all his Sons\\xe2\\x80\\x94how many,\\r\\ntheir mother only knows\\xe2\\x80\\x94and under their immediate auspices, and partly, I\\r\\nthink, at their expense, the British government was induced to send the\\r\\nsloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South Sea.\\r\\nCommanded by a naval Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it,\\r\\nand did some service; how much does not appear. But this is not all. In 1819,\\r\\nthe same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own, to go on a\\r\\ntasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan. That ship\\xe2\\x80\\x94 well called the\\r\\n\"Syren\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94made a noble experimental cruise; and it was thus that the great\\r\\nJapanese Whaling Ground first became generally known. The Syren in this famous\\r\\nvoyage was commanded by a Captain Coffin, a Nantucketer.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAll honor to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists to the\\r\\npresent day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago have slipped\\r\\nhis cable for the great South Sea of the other world.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe ship named after him was worthy of the honor, being a very fast sailer and\\r\\na noble craft every way. I boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the\\r\\nPatagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the forecastle. It was a fine gam\\r\\nwe had, and they were all trumps\\xe2\\x80\\x94every soul on board. A short life to them, and\\r\\na jolly death. And that fine gam I had\\xe2\\x80\\x94 long, very long after old Ahab touched\\r\\nher planks with his ivory heel\\xe2\\x80\\x94 it minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon\\r\\nhospitality of that ship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember\\r\\nme, if I ever lose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip? Yes, and we\\r\\nflipped it at the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for\\r\\nit\\'s squally off there by Patagonia), and all hands\\xe2\\x80\\x94 visitors and all\\xe2\\x80\\x94were\\r\\ncalled to reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each other\\r\\naloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into the\\r\\nsails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the howling gale, a warning\\r\\nexample to all drunken tars. However, the masts did not go overboard; and by\\r\\nand by we scrambled down, so sober, that we had to pass the flip again, though\\r\\nthe savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle, rather too much\\r\\ndiluted and pickled it for my taste.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe beef was fine\\xe2\\x80\\x94tough, but with body in it. They said it was bullbeef;\\r\\nothers, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for certain, how that\\r\\nwas. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial, symmetrically globular,\\r\\nand indestructible dumplings. I fancied that you could feel them, and roll them\\r\\nabout in you after they were swallowed. If you stooped over too far forward,\\r\\nyou risked their pitching out of you like billiard-balls. The bread\\xe2\\x80\\x94 but that\\r\\ncouldn\\'t be helped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic, in short, the bread\\r\\ncontained the only fresh fare they had. But the forecastle was not very light,\\r\\nand it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it. But all\\r\\nin all, taking her from truck to helm, considering the dimensions of the cook\\'s\\r\\nboilers, including his own live parchment boilers; fore and aft, I say, the\\r\\nSamuel Enderby was a jolly ship; of good fare and plenty; fine flip and strong;\\r\\ncrack fellows all, and capital from boot heels to hat-band.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other English\\r\\nwhalers I know of\\xe2\\x80\\x94not all though\\xe2\\x80\\x94were such famous, hospitable ships; that\\r\\npassed round the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the joke; and were not\\r\\nsoon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing? I will tell you. The\\r\\nabounding good cheer of these English whalers is matter for historical\\r\\nresearch. Nor have I been at all sparing of historical whale research, when it\\r\\nhas seemed needed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders, Zealanders,\\r\\nand Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant in the fishery; and\\r\\nwhat is yet more, their fat old fashions, touching plenty to eat and drink.\\r\\nFor, as a general thing, the English merchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so\\r\\nthe English whaler. Hence, in the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is\\r\\nnot normal and natural, but incidental and particular; and, therefore, must\\r\\nhave some special origin, which is here pointed out, and will be still further\\r\\nelucidated.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDuring my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an ancient\\r\\nDutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew must be about\\r\\nwhalers. The title was, \"Dan Coopman,\" wherefore I concluded that this must be\\r\\nthe invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam cooper in the fishery, as every whale\\r\\nship must carry its cooper. I was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it\\r\\nwas the production of one \"Fitz Swackhammer.\" But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a\\r\\nvery learned man, professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of\\r\\nSanta Claus and St. Potts, to whom I handed the work for translation, giving\\r\\nhim a box of sperm candles for his trouble\\xe2\\x80\\x94this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as\\r\\nhe spied the book, assured me that \"Dan Coopman\" did not mean \"The Cooper,\" but\\r\\n\"The Merchant.\" In short, this ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated of\\r\\nthe commerce of Holland; and, among other subjects, contained a very\\r\\ninteresting account of its whale fishery. And in this chapter it was, headed,\\r\\n\"Smeer,\" or \"Fat,\" that I found a long detailed list of the outfits for the\\r\\nlarders and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen; from which list, as\\r\\ntranslated by Dr. Snodhead, I transcribe the following:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa00084400,000 lbs. of beef.<br>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa060,000 lbs.

In the first place, the amount\\r\\nof butter, and Texel and Leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing. I impute it,\\r\\nthough, to their naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous\\r\\nby the nature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game in\\r\\nthose frigid Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country where the\\r\\nconvivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe quantity of the beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as those\\r\\npolar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate,\\r\\nso that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen, including the short\\r\\nvoyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea, did not much exceed three months, say,\\r\\nand reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low\\r\\nDutch seamen in all; therefore, I say, we have precisely two barrels of beer\\r\\nper man, for a twelve weeks\\' allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of\\r\\nthat 550 ankers of gin. Now, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled\\r\\nas one might fancy them to have been, were the right sort of men to stand up in\\r\\na boat\\'s head, and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem somewhat\\r\\nimprobable. Yet they did aim at them, and hit them too. But this was very far\\r\\nNorth, be it remembered, where beer agrees well with the constitution; upon the\\r\\nEquator, in our southern fishery, beer would be apt to make the harpooneer\\r\\nsleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his boat; and grievous loss might ensue to\\r\\nNantucket and New Bedford.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of two or\\r\\nthree centuries ago were high livers; and that the English whalers have not\\r\\nneglected so excellent an example. For, say they, when cruising in an empty\\r\\nship, if you can get nothing better out of the world, get a good dinner out of\\r\\nit, at least. And this empties the decanter.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 102</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA Bower in the Arsacides\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly dwelt\\r\\nupon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail upon some few\\r\\ninterior structural features. But to a large and thorough sweeping\\r\\ncomprehension of him, it behoves me now to unbutton him still further, and\\r\\nuntagging the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters, and casting loose the\\r\\nhooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones, set him before you in\\r\\nhis ultimatum; that is to say, in his unconditional skeleton.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the fishery,\\r\\npretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale? Did erudite\\r\\nStubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures on the anatomy of the\\r\\nCetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a specimen rib for exhibition?\\r\\nExplain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land a full-grown whale on your deck for\\r\\nexamination, as a cook dishes a roast-pig? Surely not. A veritable witness have\\r\\nyou hitherto been, Ishmael; but have a care how you seize the privilege of\\r\\nJonah alone; the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams; the\\r\\nrafters, ridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings, making up the frame-work of\\r\\nleviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats, dairy-rooms, butteries, and\\r\\ncheeseries in his bowels.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath the\\r\\nskin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been blessed with an opportunity\\r\\nto dissect him in miniature. In a ship I belonged to, a small cub Sperm Whale\\r\\nwas once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag, to make sheaths for\\r\\nthe barbs of the harpoons, and for the heads of the lances. Think you I let\\r\\nthat chance go, without using my boat-hatchet and jack-knife, and breaking the\\r\\nseal and reading all the contents of that young cub?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their gigantic,\\r\\nfull grown development, for that rare knowledge I am indebted to my late royal\\r\\nfriend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of the Arsacides. For being at Tranque,\\r\\nyears ago, when attached to the trading-ship Dey of Algiers, I was invited to\\r\\nspend part of the Arsacidean holidays with the lord of Tranque, at his retired\\r\\npalm villa at Pupella; a sea-side glen not very far distant from what our\\r\\nsailors called Bamboo-Town, his capital.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAmong many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being gifted with a\\r\\ndevout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had brought together in Pupella\\r\\nwhatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could invent; chiefly\\r\\ncarved woods of wonderful devices, chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly\\r\\npaddles, aromatic canoes; and all these distributed among whatever natural\\r\\nwonders, the wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his\\r\\nshores.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nChief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an unusually\\r\\nlong raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his head against a\\r\\ncocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet.\\r\\nWhen the vast body had at last been stripped of its fathomdeep enfoldings, and\\r\\nthe bones become dust dry in the sun, then the skeleton was carefully\\r\\ntransported up the Pupella glen, where a grand temple of lordly palms now\\r\\nsheltered it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebrae were carved with Arsacidean\\r\\nannals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests kept up an\\r\\nunextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic head again sent forth its\\r\\nvapory spout; while, suspended from a bough, the terrific lower jaw vibrated\\r\\nover all the devotees, like the hair-hung sword that so affrighted Damocles.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was a wondrous sight. The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen; the\\r\\ntrees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the industrious earth\\r\\nbeneath was as a weaver\\'s loom, with a gorgeous carpet on it, whereof the\\r\\nground-vine tendrils formed the warp and woof, and the living flowers the\\r\\nfigures. All the trees, with all their laden branches; all the shrubs, and\\r\\nferns, and grasses; the message-carrying air; all these unceasingly were\\r\\nactive. Through the lacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying\\r\\nshuttle weaving the unwearied verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen\\r\\nweaver!\\xe2\\x80\\x94pause!\\xe2\\x80\\x94one word!\\xe2\\x80\\x94 whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck?\\r\\nwherefore all these ceaseless toilings? Speak, weaver!\\xe2\\x80\\x94stay thy hand!\\xe2\\x80\\x94 but one\\r\\nsingle word with thee! Nay\\xe2\\x80\\x94the shuttle flies\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the figures float from forth the\\r\\nloom; the fresher-rushing carpet for ever slides away. The weaver-god, he\\r\\nweaves; and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal voice; and\\r\\nby that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened; and only when we\\r\\nescape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it. For even so\\r\\nit is in all material factories. The spoken words that are inaudible among the\\r\\nflying spindles; those same words are plainly heard without the walls, bursting\\r\\nfrom the opened casements. Thereby have villainies been detected. Ah, mortal!\\r\\nthen, be heedful; for so, in all this din of the great world\\'s loom, thy\\r\\nsubtlest thinkings may be overheard afar.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the great,\\r\\nwhite, worshipped skeleton lay lounging\\xe2\\x80\\x94a gigantic idler! Yet, as the\\r\\never-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around him, the mighty\\r\\nidler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all woven over with the vines; every\\r\\nmonth assuming greener, fresher verdure; but himself a skeleton. Life folded\\r\\nDeath; Death trellised Life; the grim god wived with youthful Life, and begat\\r\\nhim curly-headed glories.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw the skull\\r\\nan altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had\\r\\nissued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of vertu.\\r\\nHe laughed. But more I marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet\\r\\nof his was genuine. To and fro I paced before this skeleton\\xe2\\x80\\x94 brushed the vines\\r\\naside\\xe2\\x80\\x94broke through the ribs\\xe2\\x80\\x94and with a ball of Arsacidean twine, wandered,\\r\\neddied long amid its many winding, shaded colonnades and arbors. But soon my\\r\\nline was out; and following it back, I emerged from the opening where I\\r\\nentered. I saw no living thing within; naught was there but bones.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the skeleton. From\\r\\ntheir arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived me taking the altitude of\\r\\nthe final rib, \"How now!\" they shouted; \"Dar\\'st thou measure this our god!\\r\\nThat\\'s for us.\" \"Aye, priests\\xe2\\x80\\x94well, how long do ye make him, then?\" But\\r\\nhereupon a fierce contest rose among them, concerning feet and inches; they\\r\\ncracked each other\\'s sconces with their yard-sticks\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the great skull echoed\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\r\\nseizing that lucky chance, I quickly concluded my own admeasurements.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThese admeasurements I now propose to set before you. But first, be it\\r\\nrecorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied measurements\\r\\nI please. Because there are skeleton authorities you can refer to, to test my\\r\\naccuracy. There is a Leviathanic Museum, they tell me, in Hull, England, one of\\r\\nthe whaling ports of that country, where they have some fine specimens of\\r\\nfin-backs and other whales. Likewise, I have heard that in the museum of\\r\\nManchester, in New Hampshire, they have what the proprietors call \"the only\\r\\nperfect specimen of a Greenland or River Whale in the United States.\" Moreover,\\r\\nat a place in Yorkshire, England, Burton Constable by name, a certain Sir\\r\\nClifford Constable has in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale, but of\\r\\nmoderate size, by no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend King\\r\\nTranquo\\'s.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged, were\\r\\noriginally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds. King Tranquo\\r\\nseizing his because he wanted it; and Sir Clifford, because he was lord of the\\r\\nseignories of those parts. Sir Clifford\\'s whale has been articulated\\r\\nthroughout; so that, like a great chest of drawers, you can open and shut him,\\r\\nin all his bony cavities\\xe2\\x80\\x94spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan\\xe2\\x80\\x94 and swing all\\r\\nday upon his lower jaw. Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and\\r\\nshutters; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at\\r\\nhis side. Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering\\r\\ngallery in the spinal column; threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his\\r\\ncerebellum; and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied verbatim\\r\\nfrom my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild wanderings at that\\r\\nperiod, there was no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics.\\r\\nBut as I was crowded for space, and wished the other parts of my body to remain\\r\\na blank page for a poem I was then composing\\xe2\\x80\\x94 at least, what untattooed parts\\r\\nmight remain\\xe2\\x80\\x94I did not trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should\\r\\ninches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 103</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMeasurement of The Whale\\'s Skeleton\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain statement,\\r\\ntouching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton we are briefly to\\r\\nexhibit. Such a statement may prove useful here.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAccording to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly base upon\\r\\nCaptain Scoresby\\'s estimate, of seventy tons for the largest sized Greenland\\r\\nwhale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful calculation, I say, a\\r\\nSperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between eighty-five and ninety feet in\\r\\nlength, and something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference, such a\\r\\nwhale will weigh at least ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a\\r\\nton, he would considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village\\r\\nof one thousand one hundred inhabitants.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThink you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to this\\r\\nleviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman\\'s imagination?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHaving already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole, jaw,\\r\\nteeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now simply point\\r\\nout what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed bones. But\\r\\nas the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of the entire extent\\r\\nof the skeleton; as it is by far the most complicated part; and as nothing is\\r\\nto be repeated concerning it in this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in\\r\\nyour mind, or under your arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a\\r\\ncomplete notion of the general structure we are about to view.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn length, the Sperm Whale\\'s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two feet: so\\r\\nthat when fully invested and extended in life, he must have been ninety feet\\r\\nlong; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one fifth in length compared\\r\\nwith the living body. Of this seventy-two feet, his skull and jaw comprised\\r\\nsome twenty feet, leaving some fifty feet of plain backbone. Attached to this\\r\\nback-bone, for something less than a third of its length, was the mighty\\r\\ncircular basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTo me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine, extending\\r\\nfar away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled the hull of a great\\r\\nship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some twenty of her naked bow-ribs are\\r\\ninserted, and the keel is otherwise, for the time, but a long, disconnected\\r\\ntimber.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck, was nearly six\\r\\nfeet long; the second, third, and fourth were each successively longer, till\\r\\nyou came to the climax of the fifth, or one of the middle ribs, which measured\\r\\neight feet and some inches. From that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till\\r\\nthe tenth and last only spanned five feet and some inches. In general\\r\\nthickness, they all bore a seemly correspondence to their length. The middle\\r\\nribs were the most arched. In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams\\r\\nwhereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the\\r\\ncircumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the\\r\\nwhale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of the Tranque\\r\\nribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the fish which, in life, is\\r\\ngreatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of the invested body of this\\r\\nparticular whale must have been at least sixteen feet; whereas, the\\r\\ncorresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet. So that this rib\\r\\nonly conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that part.\\r\\nBesides, for some way, where I now saw but a naked spine, all that had been\\r\\nonce wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels.\\r\\nStill more, for the ample fins, I here saw but a few disordered joints; and in\\r\\nplace of the weighty and majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHow vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try to\\r\\ncomprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his dead\\r\\nattenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in the heart of\\r\\nquickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his angry flukes; only on the\\r\\nprofound unbounded sea, can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly\\r\\nfound out.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a crane, to\\r\\npile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now it\\'s done, it\\r\\nlooks much like Pompey\\'s Pillar.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere are forty and odd vertebrae in all, which in the skeleton are not locked\\r\\ntogether. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a Gothic spire,\\r\\nforming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest, a middle one, is in width\\r\\nsomething less than three feet, and in depth more than four. The smallest,\\r\\nwhere the spine tapers away into the tail, is only two inches in width, and\\r\\nlooks something like a white billiard-ball. I was told that there were still\\r\\nsmaller ones, but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the\\r\\npriest\\'s children, who had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see how\\r\\nthat the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into\\r\\nsimple child\\'s play.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 104</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Fossil Whale\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFrom his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to\\r\\nenlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not compress\\r\\nhim. By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial folio. Not to tell\\r\\nover again his furlongs from spiracle to tail, and the yards he measures about\\r\\nthe waist; only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines, where they\\r\\nlie in him like great cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean\\r\\norlop-deck of a line-of-battle-ship.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSince I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behoves me to approve\\r\\nmyself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not overlooking the minutest\\r\\nseminal germs of his blood, and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his\\r\\nbowels. Having already described him in most of his present habitatory and\\r\\nanatomical peculiarities, it now remains to magnify him in an archaeological,\\r\\nfossiliferous, and antediluvian point of view. Applied to any other creature\\r\\nthan the Leviathan\\xe2\\x80\\x94to an ant or a flea\\xe2\\x80\\x94 such portly terms might justly be\\r\\ndeemed unwarrantably grandiloquent. But when Leviathan is the text, the case is\\r\\naltered. Fain am I to stagger to this enterprise under the weightiest words of\\r\\nthe dictionary. And here be it said, that whenever it has been convenient to\\r\\nconsult one in the course of these dissertations, I have invariably used a huge\\r\\nquarto edition of Johnson, expressly purchased for that purpose; because that\\r\\nfamous lexicographer\\'s uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a\\r\\nlexicon to be used by a whale author like me.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOne often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject, though it\\r\\nmay seem but an ordinary one. How, then, with me, writing of this Leviathan?\\r\\nUnconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals. Give me a condor\\'s\\r\\nquill! Give me Vesuvius\\' crater for an inkstand! Friends, hold my arms! For in\\r\\nthe mere act of penning my thoughts of this Leviathan, they weary me, and make\\r\\nme faint with their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include\\r\\nthe whole circle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men,\\r\\nand mastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the revolving panoramas of\\r\\nempire on earth, and throughout the whole universe, not excluding its suburbs.\\r\\nSuch, and so magnifying, is the virtue of a large and liberal theme! We expand\\r\\nto its bulk. To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme. No great\\r\\nand enduring volume can ever be written on the flea, though many there be who\\r\\nhave tried it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEre entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my credentials as a\\r\\ngeologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I have been a stone-mason,\\r\\nand also a great digger of ditches, canals and wells, wine-vaults, cellars, and\\r\\ncisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by way of preliminary, I desire to remind the\\r\\nreader, that while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils\\r\\nof monsters now almost completely extinct; the subsequent relics discovered in\\r\\nwhat are called the Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate\\r\\nintercepted links, between the antichronical creatures, and those whose remote\\r\\nposterity are said to have entered the Ark; all the Fossil Whales hitherto\\r\\ndiscovered belong to the Tertiary period, which is the last preceding the\\r\\nsuperficial formations. And though none of them precisely answer to any known\\r\\nspecies of the present time, they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general\\r\\nrespects, to justify their taking ranks as Cetacean fossils.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDetached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones and\\r\\nskeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals, been found at\\r\\nthe base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England, in Scotland, and in\\r\\nthe States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Among the more curious of\\r\\nsuch remains is part of a skull, which in the year 1779 was disinterred in the\\r\\nRue Dauphine in Paris, a short street opening almost directly upon the palace\\r\\nof the Tuileries; and bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of\\r\\nAntwerp, in Napoleon\\'s time. Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged\\r\\nto some utterly unknown Leviathanic species.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost complete\\r\\nvast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842, on the plantation\\r\\nof Judge Creagh, in Alabama. The awe-stricken credulous slaves in the vicinity\\r\\ntook it for the bones of one of the fallen angels. The Alabama doctors declared\\r\\nit a huge reptile, and bestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus. But some\\r\\nspecimen bones of it being taken across the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist,\\r\\nit turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a departed\\r\\nspecies. A significant illustration of the fact, again and again repeated in\\r\\nthis book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the\\r\\nshape of his fully invested body. So Owen rechristened the monster Zeuglodon;\\r\\nand in his paper read before the London Geological Society, pronounced it, in\\r\\nsubstance, one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the\\r\\nglobe have blotted out of existence.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks, jaws, ribs,\\r\\nand vertebrae, all characterized by partial resemblances to the existing breeds\\r\\nof sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar\\r\\naffinities to the annihilated antichronical Leviathans, their incalculable\\r\\nseniors; I am, by a flood, borne back to that wondrous period, ere time itself\\r\\ncan be said to have begun; for time began with man. Here Saturn\\'s grey chaos\\r\\nrolls over me, and I obtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those Polar\\r\\neternities; when wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the\\r\\nTropics; and in all the 25,000 miles of this world\\'s circumference, not an\\r\\ninhabitable hand\\'s breadth of land was visible. Then the whole world was the\\r\\nwhale\\'s; and, king of creation, he left his wake along the present lines of the\\r\\nAndes and the Himmalehs. Who can show a pedigree like Leviathan? Ahab\\'s harpoon\\r\\nhad shed older blood than the Pharaoh\\'s. Methuselah seems a schoolboy. I look\\r\\nround to shake hands with Shem. I am horror-struck at this antemosaic,\\r\\nunsourced existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale, which, having been\\r\\nbefore all time, must needs exist after all humane ages are over.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the stereotype\\r\\nplates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his ancient bust; but\\r\\nupon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost\\r\\nfossiliferous character, we find the unmistakable print of his fin. In an\\r\\napartment of the great temple of Denderah, some fifty years ago, there was\\r\\ndiscovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere,\\r\\nabounding in centaurs, griffins, and dolphins, similar to the grotesque figures\\r\\non the celestial globe of the moderns. Gliding among them, old Leviathan swam\\r\\nas of yore; was there swimming in that planisphere, centuries before Solomon\\r\\nwas cradled.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity of the\\r\\nwhale, in his own osseous postdiluvian reality, as set down by the venerable\\r\\nJohn Leo, the old Barbary traveller.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams of which\\r\\nare made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up\\r\\ndead upon that shore. The Common People imagine, that by a secret Power\\r\\nbestowed by God upon the Temple, no Whale can pass it without immediate death.\\r\\nBut the truth of the Matter is, that on either side of the Temple, there are\\r\\nRocks that shoot two Miles into the Sea, and wound the Whales when they light\\r\\nupon \\'em. They keep a Whale\\'s Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle, which\\r\\nlying upon the Ground with its convex part uppermost, makes an Arch, the Head\\r\\nof which cannot be reached by a Man upon a Camel\\'s Back. This Rib (says John\\r\\nLeo) is said to have layn there a hundred Years before I saw it. Their\\r\\nHistorians affirm, that a Prophet who prophesy\\'d of Mahomet, came from this\\r\\nTemple, and some do not stand to assert, that the Prophet Jonas was cast forth\\r\\nby the Whale at the Base of the Temple.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and if you be a\\r\\nNantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently worship there.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 105</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDoes the Whale\\'s Magnitude Diminish? - Will He Perish?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nInasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from the\\r\\nhead-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether, in the long\\r\\ncourse of his generations, he has not degenerated from the original bulk of his\\r\\nsires.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the present day\\r\\nsuperior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the Tertiary\\r\\nsystem (embracing a distinct geological period prior to man), but of the whales\\r\\nfound in that Tertiary system, those belonging to its latter formations exceed\\r\\nin size those of its earlier ones.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the Alabama\\r\\none mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than seventy feet in\\r\\nlength in the skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen, that the tape-measure\\r\\ngives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale. And I\\r\\nhave heard, on whalemen\\'s authority, that Sperm Whales have been captured near\\r\\na hundred feet long at the time of capture.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in\\r\\nmagnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may it not be, that\\r\\nsince Adam\\'s time they have degenerated?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAssuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of such\\r\\ngentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For Pliny tells us\\r\\nof Whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and Aldrovandus of others which\\r\\nmeasured eight hundred feet in length\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales!\\r\\nAnd even in the days of Banks and Solander, Cooke\\'s naturalists, we find a\\r\\nDanish member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales\\r\\n(reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards; that is,\\r\\nthree hundred and sixty feet. And Lacepede, the French naturalist, in his\\r\\nelaborate history of whales, in the very beginning of his work (page 3), sets\\r\\ndown the Right Whale at one hundred metres, three hundred and twenty-eight\\r\\nfeet. And this work was published so late as A.D. 1825.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The whale of to-day is as big\\r\\nas his ancestors in Pliny\\'s time. And if ever I go where Pliny is, I, a\\r\\nwhaleman (more than he was), will make bold to tell him so. Because I cannot\\r\\nunderstand how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies that were buried\\r\\nthousands of years before even Pliny was born, do not measure so much in their\\r\\ncoffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks; and while the cattle and other\\r\\nanimals sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the relative\\r\\nproportions in which they are drawn, just as plainly prove that the high-bred,\\r\\nstall-fed, prize cattle of Smithfield, not only equal, but far exceed in\\r\\nmagnitude the fattest of Pharaoh\\'s fat kine; in the face of all this, I will\\r\\nnot admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more recondite\\r\\nNantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient look-outs at the\\r\\nmast-heads of the whaleships, now penetrating even through Behring\\'s straits,\\r\\nand into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world; and the thousand\\r\\nharpoons and lances darted along all continental coasts; the moot point is,\\r\\nwhether Leviathan can long endure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc;\\r\\nwhether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters, and the last\\r\\nwhale, like the last man, smoke his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in\\r\\nthe final puff.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nComparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo, which,\\r\\nnot forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the prairies of Illinois\\r\\nand Missouri, and shook their iron manes and scowled with their thunder-clotted\\r\\nbrows upon the sites of populous river-capitals, where now the polite broker\\r\\nsells you land at a dollar an inch; in such a comparison an irresistible\\r\\nargument would seem furnished, to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape\\r\\nspeedy extinction.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut you must look at this matter in every light. Though so short a period\\r\\nago\\xe2\\x80\\x94not a good lifetime\\xe2\\x80\\x94the census of the buffalo in Illinois exceeded the\\r\\ncensus of men now in London, and though at the present day not one horn or hoof\\r\\nof them remains in all that region; and though the cause of this wondrous\\r\\nextermination was the spear of man; yet the far different nature of the\\r\\nwhale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the Leviathan. Forty\\r\\nmen in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales for forty-eight months think they have\\r\\ndone extremely well, and thank God, if at last they carry home the oil of forty\\r\\nfish. Whereas, in the days of the old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers\\r\\nof the West, when the far west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a\\r\\nwilderness and a virgin, the same number of moccasined men, for the same number\\r\\nof months, mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain not\\r\\nforty, but forty thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need were, could\\r\\nbe statistically stated.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favor of the gradual\\r\\nextinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former years (the latter\\r\\npart of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in small pods, were\\r\\nencountered much oftener than at present, and, in consequence, the voyages were\\r\\nnot so prolonged, and were also much more remunerative. Because, as has been\\r\\nelsewhere noticed, those whales, influenced by some views to safety, now swim\\r\\nthe seas in immense caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered\\r\\nsolitaries, yokes, and pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into\\r\\nvast but widely separated, unfrequent armies. That is all. And equally\\r\\nfallacious seems the conceit, that because the so-called whale-bone whales no\\r\\nlonger haunt many grounds in former years abounding with them, hence that\\r\\nspecies also is declining. For they are only being driven from promontory to\\r\\ncape; and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets, then, be sure,\\r\\nsome other and remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar\\r\\nspectacle.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFurthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have two firm\\r\\nfortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever remain impregnable.\\r\\nAnd as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty Swiss have retreated to\\r\\ntheir mountains; so, hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas,\\r\\nthe whale-bone whales can at last resort to their Polar citadels, and diving\\r\\nunder the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there, come up among icy fields\\r\\nand floes! and in a charmed circle of everlasting December, bid defiance to all\\r\\npursuit from man.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one cachalot,\\r\\nsome philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc has\\r\\nalready very seriously diminished their battalions. But though for some time\\r\\npast a number of these whales, not less than 13,000, have been annually slain\\r\\non the nor\\'west coast by the Americans alone; yet there are considerations\\r\\nwhich render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing\\r\\nargument in this matter.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNatural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of the\\r\\nmore enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we say to Harto, the\\r\\nhistorian of Goa, when he tells us that at one hunting the King of Siam took\\r\\n4,000 elephants; that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves of\\r\\ncattle in the temperate climes. And there seems no reason to doubt that if\\r\\nthese elephants, which have now been hunted for thousands of years, by\\r\\nSemiramis, by Porus, by Hannibal, and by all the successive monarchs of the\\r\\nEast\\xe2\\x80\\x94 if they still survive there in great numbers, much more may the great\\r\\nwhale outlast all hunting, since he has a pasture to expatiate in, which is\\r\\nprecisely twice as large as all Asia, both Americas, Europe and Africa, New\\r\\nHolland, and all the Isles of the sea combined.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMoreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity of whales,\\r\\ntheir probably attaining the age of a century and more, therefore at any one\\r\\nperiod of time, several distinct adult generations must be contemporary. And\\r\\nwhat this is, we may soon gain some idea of, by imagining all the grave-yards,\\r\\ncemeteries, and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all\\r\\nthe men, women, and children who were alive seventy-five years ago; and adding\\r\\nthis countless host to the present human population of the globe.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his species,\\r\\nhowever perishable in his individuality. He swam the seas before the continents\\r\\nbroke water; he once swam over the site of the Tuileries, and Windsor Castle,\\r\\nand the Kremlin. In Noah\\'s flood he despised Noah\\'s Ark; and if ever the world\\r\\nis to be again flooded, like the Netherlands, to kill off its rats, then the\\r\\neternal whale will still survive, and rearing upon the topmost crest of the\\r\\nequatorial flood, spout his frothed defiance to the skies.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 106</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAhab\\'s Leg\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel Enderby\\r\\nof London, had not been unattended with some small violence to his own person.\\r\\nHe had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg\\r\\nhad received a half-splintering shock. And when after gaining his own deck, and\\r\\nhis own pivot-hole there, he so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command\\r\\nto the steersman (it was, as ever, something about his not steering inflexibly\\r\\nenough); then, the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and\\r\\nwrench, that though it still remained entire, and to all appearances lusty, yet\\r\\nAhab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his pervading, mad\\r\\nrecklessness, Ahab, did at times give careful heed to the condition of that\\r\\ndead bone upon which he partly stood. For it had not been very long prior to\\r\\nthe Pequod\\'s sailing from Nantucket, that he had been found one night lying\\r\\nprone upon the ground, and insensible; by some unknown, and seemingly\\r\\ninexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his ivory limb having been so violently\\r\\ndisplaced, that it had stake-wise smitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor\\r\\nwas it without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all the\\r\\nanguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a former\\r\\nwoe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most poisonous reptile of\\r\\nthe marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the\\r\\ngrove; so, equally with every felicity, all miserable events do naturally beget\\r\\ntheir like. Yea, more than equally, thought Ahab; since both the ancestry and\\r\\nposterity of Grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not\\r\\nto hint of this: that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings, that\\r\\nwhile some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the\\r\\nother world, but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the joy-childlessness\\r\\nof all hell\\'s despair; whereas, some guilty mortal miseries shall still\\r\\nfertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond\\r\\nthe grave; not at all to hint of this, there still seems an inequality in the\\r\\ndeeper analysis of the thing. For, thought Ahab, while even the highest earthly\\r\\nfelicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them, but, at\\r\\nbottom, all heartwoes, a mystic significance, and, in some men, an archangelic\\r\\ngrandeur; so do their diligent tracings-out not belie the obvious deduction. To\\r\\ntrail the genealogies of these high mortal miseries, carries us at last among\\r\\nthe sourceless primogenitures of the gods; so that, in the face of all the\\r\\nglad, hay-making suns, and softcymballing, round harvest-moons, we must needs\\r\\ngive in to this: that the gods themselves are not for ever glad. The\\r\\nineffaceable, sad birth-mark in the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in\\r\\nthe signers.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nUnwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more properly,\\r\\nin set way, have been disclosed before. With many other particulars concerning\\r\\nAhab, always had it remained a mystery to some, why it was, that for a certain\\r\\nperiod, both before and after the sailing of the Pequod, he had hidden himself\\r\\naway with such Grand-Lama-like exclusiveness; and, for that one interval,\\r\\nsought speechless refuge, as it were, among the marble senate of the dead.\\r\\nCaptain Peleg\\'s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate;\\r\\nthough, indeed, as touching all Ahab\\'s deeper part, every revelation partook\\r\\nmore of significant darkness than of explanatory light. But, in the end, it all\\r\\ncame out; this one matter did, at least. That direful mishap was at the bottom\\r\\nof his temporary recluseness. And not only this, but to that ever-contracting,\\r\\ndropping circle ashore, who for any reason, possessed the privilege of a less\\r\\nbanned approach to him; to that timid circle the above hinted\\r\\ncasualty\\xe2\\x80\\x94remaining, as it did, moodily unaccounted for by Ahab\\xe2\\x80\\x94invested itself\\r\\nwith terrors, not entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails. So\\r\\nthat, through their zeal for him, they had all conspired, so far as in them\\r\\nlay, to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others; and hence it was,\\r\\nthat not till a considerable interval had elapsed, did it transpire upon the\\r\\nPequod\\'s decks.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the air, or the\\r\\nvindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or not with earthly Ahab,\\r\\nyet, in this present matter of his leg, he took plain practical procedures;\\xe2\\x80\\x94 he\\r\\ncalled the carpenter.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without delay set\\r\\nabout making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him supplied with all the\\r\\nstuds and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale) which had thus far been accumulated\\r\\non the voyage, in order that a careful selection of the stoutest,\\r\\nclearest-grained stuff might be secured. This done, the carpenter received\\r\\norders to have the leg completed that night; and to provide all the fittings\\r\\nfor it, independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use. Moreover,\\r\\nthe ship\\'s forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the\\r\\nhold; and, to accelerate the affair, the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at\\r\\nonce to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 107</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Carpenter\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSeat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high abstracted\\r\\nman alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe.

But most humble\\r\\nthough he was, and far from furnishing an example of the high, humane\\r\\nabstraction; the Pequod\\'s carpenter was no duplicate; hence, he now comes in\\r\\nperson on this stage.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLike all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging to\\r\\nwhaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-hand, practical extent, alike\\r\\nexperienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own; the\\r\\ncarpenter\\'s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those\\r\\nnumerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary\\r\\nmaterial. But, besides the application to him of the generic remark above, this\\r\\ncarpenter of the Pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless\\r\\nmechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship, upon a three or\\r\\nfour years\\' voyage, in uncivilized and far-distant seas. For not to speak of\\r\\nhis readiness in ordinary duties:\\xe2\\x80\\x94 repairing stove boats, sprung spars,\\r\\nreforming the shape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull\\'s eyes in the deck,\\r\\nor new tree-nails in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more\\r\\ndirectly pertaining to his special business; he was moreover unhesitatingly\\r\\nexpert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes, both useful and capricious.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold, was his\\r\\nvice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices, of\\r\\ndifferent sizes, and both of iron and of wood. At all times except when whales\\r\\nwere alongside, this bench was securely lashed athwartships against the rear of\\r\\nthe Try-works.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole: the\\r\\ncarpenter claps it into one of his ever ready vices, and straightway files it\\r\\nsmaller. A lost landbird of strange plumage strays on board, and is made a\\r\\ncaptive: out of clean shaved rods of right-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm\\r\\nwhale ivory, the carpenter makes a pagoda-looking cage for it. An oarsman\\r\\nsprains his wrist: the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion. Stubb longed for\\r\\nvermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar; screwing each\\r\\noar in his big vice of wood, the carpenter symmetrically supplies the\\r\\nconstellation. A sailor takes a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the\\r\\ncarpenter drills his ears. Another has the toothache: the carpenter out\\r\\npincers, and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there; but the\\r\\npoor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation; whirling round\\r\\nthe handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that,\\r\\nif he would have him draw the tooth.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent and\\r\\nwithout respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he deemed but\\r\\ntop-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But while now upon so\\r\\nwide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness\\r\\nin him, too; all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of\\r\\nintelligence. But not precisely so. For nothing was this man more remarkable,\\r\\nthan for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it\\r\\nso shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things, that it seemed one with\\r\\nthe general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world; which while\\r\\npauselessly active in uncounted modes, still eternally holds its peace, and\\r\\nignores you, though you dig foundations for cathedrals. Yet was this\\r\\nhalf-horrible stolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an\\r\\nall-ramifying heartlessness;\\xe2\\x80\\x94 yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an old,\\r\\ncrutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now and then\\r\\nwith a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have served to pass the time\\r\\nduring the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of Noah\\'s ark. Was it that\\r\\nthis old carpenter had been a life-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and\\r\\nfro, not only had gathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever\\r\\nsmall outward clingings might have originally pertained to him? He was a stript\\r\\nabstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born babe; living\\r\\nwithout premeditated reference to this world or the next. You might almost say,\\r\\nthat this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence;\\r\\nfor in his numerous trades, he did not seem to work so much by reason or by\\r\\ninstinct, or simply because he had been tutored to it, or by any intermixture\\r\\nof all these, even or uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb,\\r\\nspontaneous literal process. He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had\\r\\never had one, must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers. He\\r\\nwas like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful, multum in parvo,\\r\\nSheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior\\xe2\\x80\\x94 though a little swelled\\xe2\\x80\\x94of a\\r\\ncommon pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of various sizes, but also\\r\\nscrew-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls, pens, rulers, nail-filers,\\r\\ncountersinkers. So, if his superiors wanted to use the carpenter for a\\r\\nscrew-driver, all they had to do was to open that part of him, and the screw\\r\\nwas fast: or if for tweezers, take him up by the legs, and there they were.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nYet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter, was, after\\r\\nall, no mere machine of an automaton. If he did not have a common soul in him,\\r\\nhe had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its duty. What that was,\\r\\nwhether essence of quicksilver, or a few drops of hartshorn, there is no\\r\\ntelling. But there it was; and there it had abided for now some sixty years or\\r\\nmore. And this it was, this same unaccountable, cunning life-principle in him;\\r\\nthis it was, that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing; but only\\r\\nlike an unreasoning wheel, which also hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his\\r\\nbody was a sentry-box and this soliloquizer on guard there, and talking all the\\r\\ntime to keep himself awake.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 108</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAhab and the Carpenter\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Deck - First Night Watch\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n(Carpenter standing before his vice-bench, and by the light of two lanterns\\r\\nbusily filing the ivory joist for the leg, which joist is firmly fixed in the\\r\\nvice.

How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking thing may not\\r\\nbe invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where thou now\\r\\nstandest; aye, and standing there in thy spite? In thy most solitary hours,\\r\\nthen, dost thou not fear eavesdroppers? Hold, don\\'t speak! And if I still feel\\r\\nthe smart of my crushed leg, though it be now so long dissolved; then, why\\r\\nmayest not thou, carpenter, feel the fiery pains of hell for ever, and without\\r\\na body? Hah!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nGood Lord! Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over again;<br>\\r\\nI think I didn\\'t carry a small figure, sir.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLook ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.\\xe2\\x80\\x94How long before this leg is\\r\\ndone?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPerhaps an hour, sir.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBungle away at it then, and bring it to me (turns to go). Oh, Life. Here I am,\\r\\nproud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for a bone to\\r\\nstand on! Cursed be that mortal inter-indebtedness which will not do away with\\r\\nledgers.

I am\\r\\nso rich, I could have given bid for bid with the wealthiest Praetorians at the\\r\\nauction of the Roman empire (which was the world\\'s); and yet I owe for the\\r\\nflesh in the tongue I brag with. By heavens! I\\'ll get a crucible, and into it,\\r\\nand dissolve myself down to one small, compendious vertebra. So.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCarpenter ( resuming his work).\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWell, well, well!

And here\\'s his leg. Yes, now that I\\r\\nthink of it, here\\'s his bed-fellow! has a stick of whale\\'s jaw-bone for a wife!\\r\\nAnd this is his leg; he\\'ll stand on this. What was that now about one leg\\r\\nstanding in three places, and all three places standing in one hell\\xe2\\x80\\x94 how was\\r\\nthat? Oh! I don\\'t wonder he looked so scornful at me! I\\'m a sort of\\r\\nstrange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that\\'s only haphazard-like. Then, a\\r\\nshort, little old body like me, should never undertake to wade out into deep\\r\\nwaters with tall, heron-built captains; the water chucks you under the chin\\r\\npretty quick, and there\\'s a great cry for life-boats. And here\\'s the heron\\'s\\r\\nleg! long and slim, sure enough! Now, for most folks one pair of legs lasts a\\r\\nlifetime, and that must be because they use them mercifully, as a\\r\\ntender-hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old coach-horses. But Ahab; oh he\\'s\\r\\na hard driver. Look, driven one leg to death, and spavined the other for life,\\r\\nand now wears out bone legs by the cord. Halloa, there, you Smut! bear a hand\\r\\nthere with those screws, and let\\'s finish it before the resurrection fellow\\r\\ncomes a-calling with his horn for all legs, true or false, as brewery men go\\r\\nround collecting old beer barrels, to fill \\'em up again. What a leg this is! It\\r\\nlooks like a real live leg, filed down to nothing but the core; he\\'ll be\\r\\nstanding on this to-morrow; he\\'ll be taking altitudes on it. Halloa!

Much concern was shown; and Starbuck went down into the cabin to\\r\\nreport this unfavorable affair.*\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n*In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board, it is a\\r\\nregular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and drench the casks\\r\\nwith sea-water; which afterwards, at varying intervals, is removed by the\\r\\nship\\'s pumps. Hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight; while by the\\r\\nchanged character of the withdrawn water, the mariners readily detect any\\r\\nserious leakage in the precious cargo.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa and the\\r\\nBashee Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets from the China\\r\\nwaters into the Pacific.

So with poor Queequeg, who, as harpooneer, must not only face\\r\\nall the rage of the living whale, but\\xe2\\x80\\x94as we have elsewhere seen\\xe2\\x80\\x94mount his dead\\r\\nback in a rolling sea; and finally descend into the gloom of the hold, and\\r\\nbitterly sweating all day in that subterraneous confinement, resolutely\\r\\nmanhandle the clumsiest casks and see to their stowage. To be short, among\\r\\nwhalemen, the harpooneers are the holders, so called.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPoor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should have\\r\\nstooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there; where, stripped to\\r\\nhis woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that dampness\\r\\nand slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well. And a well, or\\r\\nan ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor pagan; where, strange to say, for\\r\\nall the heat of his sweatings, he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a\\r\\nfever; and at last, after some days\\' suffering, laid him in his hammock, close\\r\\nto the very sill of the door of death. How he wasted and wasted away in those\\r\\nfew long-lingering days, till there seemed but little left of him but his frame\\r\\nand tattooing. But as all else in him thinned, and his cheek-bones grew\\r\\nsharper, his eyes, nevertheless, seemed growing fuller and fuller; they became\\r\\nof a strange softness of lustre; and mildly but deeply looked out at you there\\r\\nfrom his sickness, a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which\\r\\ncould not die, or be weakened. And like circles on the water, which, as they\\r\\ngrow fainter, expand; so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings\\r\\nof Eternity. An awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the\\r\\nside of this waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any\\r\\nbeheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died. For whatever is truly wondrous\\r\\nand fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books. And the drawing near\\r\\nof Death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all with a last revelation,\\r\\nwhich only an author from the dead could adequately tell. So that\\xe2\\x80\\x94let us say it\\r\\nagain\\xe2\\x80\\x94 no dying Chaldee or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those,\\r\\nwhose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as he\\r\\nquietly lay in his swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking\\r\\nhim to his final rest, and the ocean\\'s invisible flood-tide lifted him higher\\r\\nand higher towards his destined heaven.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNot a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself, what he\\r\\nthought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favor he asked. He called\\r\\none to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was just breaking, and\\r\\ntaking his hand, said that while in Nantucket he had chanced to see certain\\r\\nlittle canoes of dark wood, like the rich war-wood of his native isle; and upon\\r\\ninquiry, he had learned that all whalemen who died in Nantucket, were laid in\\r\\nthose same dark canoes, and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased\\r\\nhim; for it was not unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a\\r\\ndead warrior, stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be floated\\r\\naway to the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they believe that the stars\\r\\nare isles, but that far beyond all visible horizons, their own mild,\\r\\nuncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens; and so form the white\\r\\nbreakers of the milky way. He added, that he shuddered at the thought of being\\r\\nburied in his hammock, according to the usual sea-custom, tossed like something\\r\\nvile to the death-devouring sharks. No: he desired a canoe like those of\\r\\nNantucket, all the more congenial to him, being a whaleman, that like a\\r\\nwhale-boat these coffin-canoes were without a keel; though that involved but\\r\\nuncertain steering, and much lee-way adown the dim ages.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter was at\\r\\nonce commanded to do Queequeg\\'s bidding, whatever it might include. There was\\r\\nsome heathenish, coffin-colored old lumber aboard, which, upon a long previous\\r\\nvoyage, had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands, and\\r\\nfrom these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be made. No sooner was the\\r\\ncarpenter apprised of the order, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all\\r\\nthe indifferent promptitude of his character, proceeded into the forecastle and\\r\\ntook Queequeg\\'s measure with great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg\\'s\\r\\nperson as he shifted the rule.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Ah! poor fellow! he\\'ll have to die now,\" ejaculated the<br>\\r\\nLong Island sailor.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nGoing to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general\\r\\nreference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin was to\\r\\nbe, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its\\r\\nextremities. This done, he marshalled the planks and his tools, and to work.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he lightly\\r\\nshouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring whether they were\\r\\nready for it yet in that direction.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOverhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people on deck\\r\\nbegan to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every one\\'s consternation,\\r\\ncommanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him, nor was there any\\r\\ndenying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some dying men are the most\\r\\ntyrannical; and certainly, since they will shortly trouble us so little for\\r\\nevermore, the poor fellows ought to be indulged.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLeaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an\\r\\nattentive eye. He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock drawn from\\r\\nit, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the\\r\\npaddles of his boat. All by his own request, also, biscuits were then ranged\\r\\nround the sides within; a flask of fresh water was placed at the head, and a\\r\\nsmall bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot; and a piece of\\r\\nsail-cloth being rolled up for a pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted\\r\\ninto his final bed, that he might make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He\\r\\nlay without moving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring out\\r\\nhis little god, Yojo. Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo between,\\r\\nhe called for the coffin lid (hatch he called it) to be placed over him. The\\r\\nhead part turned over with a leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg in his\\r\\ncoffin with little but his composed countenance in view. \"Rarmai\" (it will do;\\r\\nit is easy), he murmured at last, and signed to be replaced in his hammock.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all the while,\\r\\ndrew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings, took him by the hand; in\\r\\nthe other, holding his tambourine.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving? Where go ye\\r\\nnow? But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where the beaches are\\r\\nonly beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little errand for me?

So, to my fond faith, poor Pip, in this strange sweetness of his\\r\\nlunacy, brings heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes.

Shame! shame!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDuring all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream.<br>\\r\\nPip was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now that his\\r\\ncoffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon there seemed no\\r\\nneed of the carpenter\\'s box; and thereupon, when some expressed their delighted\\r\\nsurprise, he, in substance, said, that the cause of his sudden convalescence\\r\\nwas this;\\xe2\\x80\\x94 at a critical moment, he had just recalled a little duty ashore,\\r\\nwhich he was leaving undone; and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he\\r\\ncould not die yet, he averred. They asked him, then, whether to live or die was\\r\\na matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a\\r\\nword, it was Queequeg\\'s conceit, that if a man made up his mind to live, mere\\r\\nsickness could not kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent,\\r\\nungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized; that\\r\\nwhile a sick, civilized man may be six months convalescing, generally speaking,\\r\\na sick savage is almost half-well again in a day. So, in good time my Queequeg\\r\\ngained strength; and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent\\r\\ndays (but eating with a vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet,\\r\\nthrew out his arms and legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned a little\\r\\nbit, and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat, and poising a\\r\\nharpoon, pronounced himself fit for a fight.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWith a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and emptying\\r\\ninto it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there. Many spare hours he\\r\\nspent, in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque figures and drawings;\\r\\nand it seemed that hereby he was striving, in his rude way, to copy parts of\\r\\nthe twisted tattooing on his body. And this tattooing had been the work of a\\r\\ndeparted prophet and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had\\r\\nwritten out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a\\r\\nmystical treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that Queequeg in his own\\r\\nproper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous work in one volume; but whose\\r\\nmysteries not even himself could read, though his own live heart beat against\\r\\nthem; and these mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away\\r\\nwith the living parchment whereon they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to\\r\\nthe last. And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild\\r\\nexclamation of his, when one morning turning away from surveying poor\\r\\nQueequeg\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Oh, devilish tantalization of the gods!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 111</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Pacific\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great South Sea;\\r\\nwere it not for other things I could have greeted my dear Pacific with\\r\\nuncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of my youth was answered; that\\r\\nserene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues of blue.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose gently awful\\r\\nstirrings seems to speak of some hidden soul beneath; like those fabled\\r\\nundulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St. John. And meet\\r\\nit is, that over these sea-pastures, wide-rolling watery prairies and Potters\\'\\r\\nFields of all four continents, the waves should rise and fall, and ebb and flow\\r\\nunceasingly; for here, millions of mixed shades and shadows, drowned dreams,\\r\\nsomnambulisms, reveries; all that we call lives and souls, lie dreaming,\\r\\ndreaming, still; tossing like slumberers in their beds; the ever-rolling waves\\r\\nbut made so by their restlessness.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTo any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld, must ever\\r\\nafter be the sea of his adoption. It rolls the midmost waters of the world, the\\r\\nIndian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms. The same waves wash the moles of\\r\\nthe new-built California towns, but yesterday planted by the recentest race of\\r\\nmen and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than\\r\\nAbraham; while all between float milky-ways of coral isles, and low-lying,\\r\\nendless, unknown Archipelagoes, and impenetrable Japans. Thus this mysterious,\\r\\ndivine Pacific zones the world\\'s whole bulk about; makes all coasts one bay to\\r\\nit; seems the tide-beating heart of earth. Lifted by those eternal swells, you\\r\\nneeds must own the seductive god, bowing your head to Pan.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab\\'s brain, as standing, like an iron statue\\r\\nat his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with one nostril he\\r\\nunthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee isles (in whose sweet\\r\\nwoods mild lovers must be walking), and with the other consciously inhaled the\\r\\nsalt breath of the new found sea; that sea in which the hated White Whale must\\r\\neven then be swimming. Launched at length upon these almost final waters, and\\r\\ngliding towards the Japanese cruising-ground, the old man\\'s purpose intensified\\r\\nitself. His firm lips met like the lips of a vice; the Delta of his forehead\\'s\\r\\nveins swelled like overladen brooks; in his very sleep, his ringing cry ran\\r\\nthrough the vaulted hull, \"Stern all! the White Whale spouts thick blood!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 112</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Blacksmith\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAvailing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned in these\\r\\nlatitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits shortly to be\\r\\nanticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered old blacksmith, had not removed his\\r\\nportable forge to the hold again, after concluding his contributory work for\\r\\nAhab\\'s leg, but still retained it on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the\\r\\nforemast; being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and\\r\\nharpooneers, and bowsmen to do some little job for them; altering, or\\r\\nrepairing, or new shaping their various weapons and boat furniture. Often he\\r\\nwould be surrounded by an eager circle, all waiting to be served; holding\\r\\nboat-spades, pikeheads, harpoons, and lances, and jealously watching his every\\r\\nsooty movement, as he toiled. Nevertheless, this old man\\'s was a patient hammer\\r\\nwielded by a patient arm. No murmur, no impatience, no petulance did come from\\r\\nhim. Silent, slow, and solemn; bowing over still further his chronically broken\\r\\nback, he toiled away, as if toil were life itself, and the heavy beating of his\\r\\nhammer the heavy beating of his heart. And so it was.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Most miserable!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful appearing yawing\\r\\nin his gait, had at an early period of the voyage excited the curiosity of the\\r\\nmariners. And to the importunity of their persisted questionings he had finally\\r\\ngiven in; and so it came to pass that every one now knew the shameful story of\\r\\nhis wretched fate.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBelated, and not innocently, one bitter winter\\'s midnight, on the road running\\r\\nbetween two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly felt the deadly\\r\\nnumbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a leaning, dilapidated barn.\\r\\nThe issue was, the loss of the extremities of both feet. Out of this\\r\\nrevelation, part by part, at last came out the four acts of the gladness, and\\r\\nthe one long, and as yet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his life\\'s\\r\\ndrama.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly encountered\\r\\nthat thing in sorrow\\'s technicals called ruin. He had been an artisan of famed\\r\\nexcellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house and garden; embraced a\\r\\nyouthful, daughter-like, loving wife, and three blithe, ruddy children; every\\r\\nSunday went to a cheerful-looking church, planted in a grove. But one night,\\r\\nunder cover of darkness, and further concealed in a most cunning disguisement,\\r\\na desperate burglar slid into his happy home, and robbed them all of\\r\\neverything. And darker yet to tell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly\\r\\nconduct this burglar into his family\\'s heart. It was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon\\r\\nthe opening of that fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his\\r\\nhome. Now, for prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith\\'s shop\\r\\nwas in the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so\\r\\nthat always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy\\r\\nnervousness, but with vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing of her\\r\\nyoung-armed old husband\\'s hammer; whose reverberations, muffled by passing\\r\\nthrough the floors and walls, came up to her, not unsweetly, in her nursery;\\r\\nand so, to stout Labor\\'s iron lullaby, the blacksmith\\'s infants were rocked to\\r\\nslumber.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely? Hadst thou\\r\\ntaken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him, then had\\r\\nthe young widow had a delicious grief, and her orphans a truly venerable,\\r\\nlegendary sire to dream of in their after years; and all of them a care-killing\\r\\ncompetency. But Death plucked down some virtuous elder brother, on whose\\r\\nwhistling daily toil solely hung the responsibilities of some other family, and\\r\\nleft the worse than useless old man standing, till the hideous rot of life\\r\\nshould make him easier to harvest.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhy tell the whole? The blows of the basement hammer every day grew more and\\r\\nmore between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the last; the wife sat\\r\\nfrozen at the window, with tearless eyes, glitteringly gazing into the weeping\\r\\nfaces of her children; the bellows fell; the forge choked up with cinders; the\\r\\nhouse was sold; the mother dived down into the long church-yard grass; her\\r\\nchildren twice followed her thither; and the houseless, familyless old man\\r\\nstaggered off a vagabond in crape; his every woe unreverenced; his grey head a\\r\\nscorn to flaxen curls!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDeath seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but Death is only\\r\\na launching into the region of the strange Untried; it is but the first\\r\\nsalutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote, the Wild, the Watery,\\r\\nthe Unshored; therefore, to the death-longing eyes of such men, who still have\\r\\nleft in them some interior compunctions against suicide, does the\\r\\nall-contributed and all-receptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain\\r\\nof unimaginable, taking terrors, and wonderful, new-life adventures; and from\\r\\nthe hearts of infinite Pacifics, the thousand mermaids sing to them\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Come\\r\\nhither, broken-hearted; here is another life without the guilt of intermediate\\r\\ndeath; here are wonders supernatural, without dying for them.

Ahoy, there!\\r\\nTashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me as much blood\\r\\nas will cover this barb?\" holding it high up. A cluster of dark nods replied,\\r\\nYes. Three punctures were made in the heathen flesh, and the White Whale\\'s\\r\\nbarbs were then tempered.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!\" deliriously\\r\\nhowled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the baptismal blood.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of hickory, with\\r\\nthe bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the socket of the iron. A\\r\\ncoil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some fathoms of it taken to the\\r\\nwindlass, and stretched to a great tension. Pressing his foot upon it, till the\\r\\nrope hummed like a harp-string, then eagerly bending over it, and seeing no\\r\\nstrandings, Ahab exclaimed, \"Good! and now for the seizings.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread yarns were\\r\\nall braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the pole was then driven\\r\\nhard up into the socket; from the lower end the rope was traced halfway along\\r\\nthe pole\\'s length, and firmly secured so, with inter-twistings of twine. This\\r\\ndone, pole, iron, and rope\\xe2\\x80\\x94like the Three Fates\\xe2\\x80\\x94 remained inseparable, and Ahab\\r\\nmoodily stalked away with the weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the sound\\r\\nof the hickory pole, both hollowly ringing along every plank. But ere he\\r\\nentered his cabin, a light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous sound\\r\\nwas heard. Oh! Pip, thy wretched laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy\\r\\nstrange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the\\r\\nmelancholy ship, and mocked it!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 114</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Gilder\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPenetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising ground\\r\\nthe Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery.

And all this mixes with your most mystic mood; so that fact\\r\\nand fancy, half-way meeting, interpenetrate, and form one seamless whole.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as temporary\\r\\nan effect on Ahab.

Signals, ensigns, and jacks of all colors were flying from her\\r\\nrigging, on every side. Sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were\\r\\ntwo barrels of sperm; above which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender\\r\\nbreakers of the same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen\\r\\nlamp.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most surprising\\r\\nsuccess; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in the same seas\\r\\nnumerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish.\\r\\nNot only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far\\r\\nmore valuable sperm, but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for,\\r\\nfrom the ships she had met; and these were stowed along the deck, and in the\\r\\ncaptain\\'s and officers\\' state-rooms. Even the cabin table itself had been\\r\\nknocked into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an\\r\\noil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece. In the forecastle, the\\r\\nsailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests, and filled them; it was\\r\\nhumorously added, that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler, and\\r\\nfilled it; that the steward had plugged his spare coffee-pot and filled it;\\r\\nthat the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them;\\r\\nthat indeed everything was filled with sperm, except the captain\\'s pantaloons\\r\\npockets, and those he reserved to thrust his hands into, in self-complacent\\r\\ntestimony of his entire satisfaction.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the barbarian\\r\\nsound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawing still nearer, a\\r\\ncrowd of her men were seen standing round her huge try-pots, which, covered\\r\\nwith the parchment-like poke or stomach skin of the black fish, gave forth a\\r\\nloud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew. On the\\r\\nquarter-deck, the mates and harpooneers were dancing with the olive-hued girls\\r\\nwho had eloped with them from the Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an\\r\\nornamented boat, firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three\\r\\nLong Island negroes, with glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were presiding\\r\\nover the hilarious jig. Meanwhile, others of the ship\\'s company were\\r\\ntumultuously busy at the masonry of the try-works, from which the huge pots had\\r\\nbeen removed. You would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed\\r\\nBastille, such wild cries they raised, as the now useless brick and mortar were\\r\\nbeing hurled into the sea.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the ship\\'s\\r\\nelevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was full before him,\\r\\nand seemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black, with a\\r\\nstubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other\\'s wakes\\xe2\\x80\\x94 one all\\r\\njubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings as to things to\\r\\ncome\\xe2\\x80\\x94their two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast\\r\\nof the scene.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Come aboard, come aboard!\" cried the gay Bachelor\\'s commander, lifting a glass\\r\\nand a bottle in the air.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Hast seen the White Whale?\" gritted Ahab in reply.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"No; only heard of him; but don\\'t believe in him at all,\" said the other\\r\\ngood-humoredly. \"Come aboard!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Thou art too damned jolly.

And as Ahab, leaning over the taffrail, eyed the homewardbound craft, he\\r\\ntook from his pocket a small vial of sand, and then looking from the ship to\\r\\nthe vial, seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together, for that\\r\\nvial was filled with Nantucket soundings.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 116</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Dying Whale\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNot seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune\\'s favorites sail\\r\\nclose by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the rushing\\r\\nbreeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out.

In good time\\r\\nthe order came. It was hard upon high noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his\\r\\nhigh-hoisted boat, was about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to\\r\\ndetermine his latitude.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of effulgences.\\r\\nThat unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy\\r\\nocean\\'s immeasurable burning-glass.

Well that Ahab\\'s quadrant was furnished\\r\\nwith colored glasses, through which to take sight of that solar fire. So,\\r\\nswinging his seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his\\r\\nastrological-looking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in that posture\\r\\nfor some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its\\r\\nprecise meridian. Meantime while his whole attention was absorbed, the Parsee\\r\\nwas kneeling beneath him on the ship\\'s deck, and with face thrown up like\\r\\nAhab\\'s, was eyeing the same sun with him; only the lids of his eyes half hooded\\r\\ntheir orbs, and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness. At\\r\\nlength the desired observation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory\\r\\nleg, Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant.\\r\\nThen falling into a moment\\'s revery, he again looked up towards the sun and\\r\\nmurmured to himself: \"Thou seamark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou tellest me\\r\\ntruly where I am\\xe2\\x80\\x94but canst thou cast the least hint where I shall be?

But as this conductor\\r\\nmust descend to considerable depth, that its end may avoid all contact with the\\r\\nhull; and as moreover, if kept constantly towing there, it would be liable to\\r\\nmany mishaps, besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging, and\\r\\nmore or less impeding the vessel\\'s way in the water; because of all this, the\\r\\nlower parts of a ship\\'s lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are\\r\\ngenerally made in long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up\\r\\ninto the chains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"The rods! the rods!\" cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished to\\r\\nvigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux, to light\\r\\nAhab to his post. \"Are they overboard? drop them over, fore and aft. Quick!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Avast!\" cried Ahab; \"let\\'s have fair play here, though we be the weaker side.\\r\\nYet I\\'ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and Andes, that all the\\r\\nworld may be secured; but out on privileges!

Relieved against the ghostly light, the gigantic jet negro, Daggoo,\\r\\nloomed up to thrice his real stature, and seemed the black cloud from which the\\r\\nthunder had come. The parted mouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth,\\r\\nwhich strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit\\r\\nup by the preternatural light, Queequeg\\'s tattooing burned like Satanic blue\\r\\nflames on his body.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more the\\r\\nPequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment or two\\r\\npassed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one. It was Stubb.\\r\\n\"What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not the same in the\\r\\nsong.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"No, no, it wasn\\'t; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I hope they\\r\\nwill, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?\\xe2\\x80\\x94have they no bowels for\\r\\na laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck\\xe2\\x80\\x94but it\\'s too dark to look. Hear me, then; I\\r\\ntake that mast-head flame we saw for a sign of good luck; for those masts are\\r\\nrooted in a hold that is going to be chock a\\' block with sperm-oil, d\\'ye see;\\r\\nand so, all that sperm will work up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes,\\r\\nour three masts will yet be as three spermaceti candles\\xe2\\x80\\x94 that\\'s the good\\r\\npromise we saw.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb\\'s face slowly beginning to\\r\\nglimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he cried: \"See! see!\" and once more the\\r\\nhigh tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled supernaturalness in\\r\\ntheir pallor.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"The corpusants have mercy on us all,\" cried Stubb, again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt the base of the main-mast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame, the\\r\\nParsee was kneeling in Ahab\\'s front, but with his head bowed away from him;\\r\\nwhile near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where they had just\\r\\nbeen engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen, arrested by the glare,\\r\\nnow cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a knot of numbed wasps from a\\r\\ndrooping, orchard twig. In various enchanted attitudes like the standing, or\\r\\nstepping, or running skeletons in Herculaneum, others remained rooted to the\\r\\ndeck; but all their eyes upcast.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Aye, aye, men!\" cried Ahab. \"Look up at it; mark it well; the white flame but\\r\\nlights the way to the White Whale! Hand me those mainmast links there; I would\\r\\nfain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against it; blood against fire! So.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen turning\\xe2\\x80\\x94the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his foot upon the\\r\\nParsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm, he stood erect\\r\\nbefore the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian once did\\r\\nworship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that to this hour I\\r\\nbear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and I now know that thy\\r\\nright worship is defiance. To neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind; and\\r\\ne\\'en for hate thou canst but kill; and all are killed. No fearless fool now\\r\\nfronts thee.

Take the homage of these poor eyes, and\\r\\nshutter-hands. I would not take it.

As the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent\\'s tongue, Starbuck\\r\\ngrasped Ahab by the arm\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"God, God is against thee, old man; forbear! \\'t is an\\r\\nill voyage! ill begun, ill continued; let me square the yards, while we may,\\r\\nold man, and make a fair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than\\r\\nthis.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOverhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the\\r\\nbraces\\xe2\\x80\\x94though not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast mate\\'s\\r\\nthoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But dashing the\\r\\nrattling lightning links to the deck, and snatching the burning harpoon, Ahab\\r\\nwaved it like a torch among them; swearing to transfix with it the first sailor\\r\\nthat but cast loose a rope\\'s end. Petrified by his aspect, and still more\\r\\nshrinking from the fiery dart that he held, the men fell back in dismay, and\\r\\nAhab again spoke:\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and heart,\\r\\nsoul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound.

Never mind; catch the turn there, and\\r\\npass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors now as if they were\\r\\nnever going to be used again. Tying these two anchors here, Flask, seems like\\r\\ntying a man\\'s hands behind him. And what big generous hands they are, to be\\r\\nsure. These are your iron fists, hey? What a hold they have, too! I wonder,\\r\\nFlask, whether the world is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings with an\\r\\nuncommon long cable, though. There, hammer that knot down, and we\\'ve done. So;\\r\\nnext to touching land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory. I say, just\\r\\nwring out my jacket skirts, will ye? Thank ye. They laugh at long-togs so,\\r\\nFlask; but seems to me, a long-tailed coat ought always to be worn in all\\r\\nstorms afloat. The tails tapering down that way, serve to carry off the water,\\r\\nd\\'ye see. Same with cocked hats; the cocks form gable-end eave-troughs, Flask.\\r\\nNo more monkey-jackets and tarpaulins for me; I must mount a swallow-tail, and\\r\\ndrive down a beaver; so.

It was thus with the Pequod\\'s; at almost every\\r\\nshock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which\\r\\nthey revolved upon the cards; it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold\\r\\nwithout some sort of unwonted emotion.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSome hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through the\\r\\nstrenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb\\xe2\\x80\\x94 one engaged forward and the other\\r\\naft\\xe2\\x80\\x94the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main-top-sails were cut\\r\\nadrift from the spars, and went eddying away to leeward, like the feathers of\\r\\nan albatross, which sometimes are cast to the winds when that storm-tossed bird\\r\\nis on the wing.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a storm-trysail\\r\\nwas set further aft; so that the ship soon went through the water with some\\r\\nprecision again; and the course\\xe2\\x80\\x94 for the present, East-south-east\\xe2\\x80\\x94which he was\\r\\nto steer, if practicable, was once more given to the helmsman. For during the\\r\\nviolence of the gale, he had only steered according to its vicissitudes. But as\\r\\nhe was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible, watching the\\r\\ncompass meanwhile, lo! a good sign! the wind seemed coming round astern; aye,\\r\\nthe foul breeze became fair!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nInstantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of \"Ho! the fair wind!\\r\\noh-ye-ho cheerly, men!\" the crew singing for joy, that so promising an event\\r\\nshould so soon have falsified the evil portents preceding it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn compliance with the standing order of his commander\\xe2\\x80\\x94 to report immediately,\\r\\nand at any one of the twenty-four hours, any decided change in the affairs of\\r\\nthe deck,\\xe2\\x80\\x94Starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to the breeze\\xe2\\x80\\x94however\\r\\nreluctantly and gloomily,\\xe2\\x80\\x94than he mechanically went below to apprise Captain\\r\\nAhab of the circumstance.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEre knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it a moment. The\\r\\ncabin lamp\\xe2\\x80\\x94taking long swings this way and that\\xe2\\x80\\x94 was burning fitfully, and\\r\\ncasting fitful shadows upon the old man\\'s bolted door,\\xe2\\x80\\x94a thin one, with fixed\\r\\nblinds inserted, in place of upper panels. The isolated subterraneousness of\\r\\nthe cabin made a certain humming silence to reign there, though it was hooped\\r\\nround by all the roar of the elements. The loaded muskets in the rack were\\r\\nshiningly revealed, as they stood upright against the forward bulkhead.\\r\\nStarbuck was an honest, upright man; but out of Starbuck\\'s heart, at that\\r\\ninstant when he saw the muskets, there strangely evolved an evil thought; but\\r\\nso blent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly\\r\\nknew it for itself.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"He would have shot me once,\" he murmured, \"yes, there\\'s the very musket that\\r\\nhe pointed at me;\\xe2\\x80\\x94that one with the studded stock; let me touch it\\xe2\\x80\\x94lift it.\\r\\nStrange, that I, who have handled so many deadly lances, strange, that I should\\r\\nshake so now.

Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant? and in\\r\\nthese same perilous seas, gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the\\r\\nerror-abounding log? and in this very Typhoon, did he not swear that he would\\r\\nhave no lightning-rods? But shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to\\r\\ndrag a whole ship\\'s company down to doom with him?\\xe2\\x80\\x94Yes, it would make him the\\r\\nwilful murderer of thirty men and more, if this ship come to any deadly harm;\\r\\nand come to deadly harm, my soul swears this ship will, if Ahab have his way.\\r\\nIf, then, he were this instant\\xe2\\x80\\x94 put aside, that crime would not be his. Ha! is\\r\\nhe muttering in his sleep? Yes, just there,\\xe2\\x80\\x94in there, he\\'s sleeping. Sleeping?\\r\\naye, but still alive, and soon awake again. I can\\'t withstand thee, then, old\\r\\nman. Not reasoning; not remonstrance; not entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all\\r\\nthis thou scornest. Flat obedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou\\r\\nbreathest. Aye, and say\\'st the men have vow\\'d thy vow; say\\'st all of us are\\r\\nAhabs. Great God forbid!\\xe2\\x80\\x94 But is there no other way? no lawful way?\\xe2\\x80\\x94Make him a\\r\\nprisoner to be taken home? What! hope to wrest this old man\\'s living power from\\r\\nhis own living hands? Only a fool would try it. Say he were pinioned even;\\r\\nknotted all over with ropes and hawsers; chained down to ring-bolts on this\\r\\ncabin floor; he would be more hideous than a caged tiger, then. I could not\\r\\nendure the sight; could not possibly fly his howlings; all comfort, sleep\\r\\nitself, inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage. What,\\r\\nthen, remains? The land is hundreds of leagues away, and locked Japan the\\r\\nnearest. I stand alone here upon an open sea, with two oceans and a whole\\r\\ncontinent between me and law.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Aye, aye, \\'tis so.\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Is heaven a murderer when its\\r\\nlightning strikes a would-be murderer in his bed, tindering sheets and skin\\r\\ntogether?\\xe2\\x80\\x94 And would I be a murderer, then, if\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94and slowly, stealthily, and\\r\\nhalf sideways looking, he placed the loaded musket\\'s end against the door.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"On this level, Ahab\\'s hammock swings within; his head this way.

The strong unstaggering breeze abounded so, that sky and air\\r\\nseemed vast outbellying sails; the whole world boomed before the wind. Muffled\\r\\nin the full morning light, the invisible sun was only known by the spread\\r\\nintensity of his place; where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks.\\r\\nEmblazonings, as of crowned Babylonian kings and queens, reigned over\\r\\neverything. The sea was as a crucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps\\r\\nwith light and heat.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLong maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every time the\\r\\nteetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to eye the\\r\\nbright sun\\'s rays produced ahead; and when she profoundly settled by the stern,\\r\\nhe turned behind, and saw the sun\\'s rearward place, and how the same yellow\\r\\nrays were blending with his undeviating wake.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot of the\\r\\nsun. Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring the sun to ye! Yoke on the\\r\\nfurther billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the sea!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards the helm,\\r\\nhuskily demanding how the ship was heading.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"East-sou-east, sir,\" said the frightened steersman.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Thou liest!\" smiting him with his clenched fist.<br>\\r\\n\"Heading East at this hour in the morning, and the sun astern?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nUpon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then observed by\\r\\nAhab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its very blinding\\r\\npalpableness must have been the cause.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThrusting his head half-way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one glimpse of the\\r\\ncompasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment he almost seemed to\\r\\nstagger. Standing behind him Starbuck looked, and lo! the two compasses pointed\\r\\nEast, and the Pequod was as infallibly going West.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the old<br>\\r\\nman with a rigid laugh exclaimed, \"I have it! It has happened before.<br>\\r\\nMr. Starbuck, last night\\'s thunder turned our compasses\\xe2\\x80\\x94that\\'s all.<br>\\r\\nThou hast before now heard of such a thing, I take it.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir,\" said the pale mate,\\r\\ngloomily.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHere, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than one\\r\\ncase occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as developed in\\r\\nthe mariner\\'s needle, is, as all know, essentially one with the electricity\\r\\nbeheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much marvelled at, that such things\\r\\nshould be. In instances where the lightning has actually struck the vessel, so\\r\\nas to smite down some of the spars and rigging, the effect upon the needle has\\r\\nat times been still more fatal; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so\\r\\nthat the before magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife\\'s knitting\\r\\nneedle. But in either case, the needle never again, of itself, recovers the\\r\\noriginal virtue thus marred or lost; and if the binnacle compasses be affected,\\r\\nthe same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship; even were the\\r\\nlowermost one inserted into the kelson.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDeliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the transpointed\\r\\ncompasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took the\\r\\nprecise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were exactly\\r\\ninverted, shouted out his orders for the ship\\'s course to be changed\\r\\naccordingly. The yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod thrust her\\r\\nundaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair one had only been\\r\\njuggling her.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMeanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said nothing, but\\r\\nquietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and Flask\\xe2\\x80\\x94who in some small\\r\\ndegree seemed then to be sharing his feelings\\xe2\\x80\\x94likewise unmurmuringly\\r\\nacquiesced. As for the men, though some of them lowly rumbled, their fear of\\r\\nAhab was greater than their fear of Fate. But as ever before, the pagan\\r\\nharpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was only\\r\\nwith a certain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible\\r\\nAhab\\'s.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries. But chancing to\\r\\nslip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper sight-tubes of the quadrant\\r\\nhe had the day before dashed to the deck.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun\\'s pilot! yesterday I wrecked thee, and\\r\\nto-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me. So, so. But Ahab is lord over\\r\\nthe level loadstone yet. Mr. Starbuck\\xe2\\x80\\x94a lance without the pole; a top-maul, and\\r\\nthe smallest of the sail-maker\\'s needles. Quick!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAccessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about to do,\\r\\nwere certain prudential motives, whose object might have been to revive the\\r\\nspirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill, in a matter so wondrous\\r\\nas that of the inverted compasses. Besides, the old man well knew that to steer\\r\\nby transpointed needles, though clumsily practicable, was not a thing to be\\r\\npassed over by superstitious sailors, without some shudderings and evil\\r\\nportents.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Men,\" said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed him the\\r\\nthings he had demanded, \"my men, the thunder turned old Ahab\\'s needles; but out\\r\\nof this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own, that will point as true as\\r\\nany.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAbashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as this was\\r\\nsaid; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might follow. But\\r\\nStarbuck looked away.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWith a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance, and\\r\\nthen handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade him hold it upright,\\r\\nwithout its touching the deck. Then, with the maul, after repeatedly smiting\\r\\nthe upper end of this iron rod, he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top\\r\\nof it, and less strongly hammered that, several times, the mate still holding\\r\\nthe rod as before. Then going through some small strange motions with\\r\\nit\\xe2\\x80\\x94whether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to\\r\\naugment the awe of the crew, is uncertain\\xe2\\x80\\x94 he called for linen thread; and\\r\\nmoving to the binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there, and\\r\\nhorizontally suspended the sail-needle by its middle, over one of the compass\\r\\ncards. At first, the steel went round and round, quivering and vibrating at\\r\\neither end; but at last it settled to its place, when Ahab, who had been\\r\\nintently watching for this result, stepped frankly back from the binnacle, and\\r\\npointing his stretched arm towards it, exclaimed,\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Look ye, for yourselves, if\\r\\nAhab be not the lord of the level loadstone! The sun is East, and that compass\\r\\nswears it!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOne after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes could persuade\\r\\nsuch ignorance as theirs, and one after another they slunk away.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his fatal\\r\\npride.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 125</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Log and Line\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhile now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log and\\r\\nline had but very seldom been in use. Owing to a confident reliance upon other\\r\\nmeans of determining the vessel\\'s place, some merchantmen, and many whalemen,\\r\\nespecially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave the log; though at the same\\r\\ntime, and frequently more for form\\'s sake than anything else, regularly putting\\r\\ndown upon the customary slate the course steered by the ship, as well as the\\r\\npresumed average rate of progression every hour. It had been thus with the\\r\\nPequod. The wooden reel and angular log attached hung, long untouched, just\\r\\nbeneath the railing of the after bulwarks. Rains and spray had damped it; the\\r\\nsun and wind had warped it; all the elements had combined to rot a thing that\\r\\nhung so idly. But heedless of all this, his mood seized Ahab, as he happened to\\r\\nglance upon the reel, not many hours after the magnet scene, and he remembered\\r\\nhow his quadrant was no more, and recalled his frantic oath about the level log\\r\\nand line. The ship was sailing plungingly; astern the billows rolled in riots.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Forward, there! Heave the log!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTwo seamen came. The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman.<br>\\r\\n\"Take the reel, one of ye, I\\'ll heave.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey went towards the extreme stern, on the ship\\'s lee side, where the deck,\\r\\nwith the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping into the creamy,\\r\\nsidelong-rushing sea.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting\\r\\nhandle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved, so stood\\r\\nwith the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced to him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAhab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty turns to\\r\\nform a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old Manxman, who was\\r\\nintently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to speak.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Sir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have spoiled\\r\\nit.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"\\'Twill hold, old gentleman. Long heat and wet, have they spoiled thee?<br>\\r\\nThou seem\\'st to hold. Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee; not thou it.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I hold the spool, sir. But just as my captain says. With these grey hairs of\\r\\nmine \\'tis not worth while disputing, \\'specially with a superior, who\\'ll ne\\'er\\r\\nconfess.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What\\'s that? There now\\'s a patched professor in Queen Nature\\'s granite-founded\\r\\nCollege; but methinks he\\'s too subservient. Where wert thou born?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Excellent! Thou\\'st hit the world by that.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I know not, sir, but I was born there.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"In the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, it\\'s good.<br>\\r\\nHere\\'s a man from Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now<br>\\r\\nunmanned of Man; which is sucked in\\xe2\\x80\\x94by what? Up with the reel!<br>\\r\\nThe dead, blind wall butts all inquiring heads at last.<br>\\r\\nUp with it! So.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe log was heaved. The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long dragging\\r\\nline astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to whirl. In turn, jerkingly\\r\\nraised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing resistance of the log\\r\\ncaused the old reelman to stagger strangely.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Hold hard!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSnap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the tugging log\\r\\nwas gone.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad sea parts\\r\\nthe log-line.

Making so long a passage through such unfrequented waters,\\r\\ndescrying no ships, and ere long, sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds,\\r\\nover waves monotonously mild; all these seemed the strange calm things\\r\\npreluding some riotous and desperate scene.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the\\r\\nEquatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before the dawn,\\r\\nwas sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch\\xe2\\x80\\x94then headed by Flask\\xe2\\x80\\x94was\\r\\nstartled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly\\xe2\\x80\\x94like half-articulated\\r\\nwailings of the ghosts of all Herod\\'s murdered Innocents\\xe2\\x80\\x94that one and all, they\\r\\nstarted from their reveries, and for the space of some moments stood, or sat,\\r\\nor leaned all transfixed by listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that\\r\\nwild cry remained within hearing. The Christian or civilized part of the crew\\r\\nsaid it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan harpooneers remained\\r\\nunappalled. Yet the grey Manxman\\xe2\\x80\\x94the oldest mariner of all\\xe2\\x80\\x94declared that the\\r\\nwild thrilling sounds that were heard, were the voices of newly drowned men in\\r\\nthe sea.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBelow in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when he came to\\r\\nthe deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask, not unaccompanied with hinted\\r\\ndark meanings. He hollowly laughed, and thus explained the wonder.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThose rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers of\\r\\nseals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or some dams that had\\r\\nlost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her,\\r\\ncrying and sobbing with their human sort of wail. But this only the more\\r\\naffected some of them, because most mariners cherish a very superstitious\\r\\nfeeling about seals, arising not only from their peculiar tones when in\\r\\ndistress, but also from the human look of their round heads and\\r\\nsemi-intelligent faces, seen peeringly uprising from the water alongside. In\\r\\nthe sea, under certain circumstances, seals have more than once been mistaken\\r\\nfor men.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible\\r\\nconfirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning. At sun-rise this\\r\\nman went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore; and whether it was that\\r\\nhe was not yet half waked from his sleep (for sailors sometimes go aloft in a\\r\\ntransition state), whether it was thus with the man, there is now no telling;\\r\\nbut, be that as it may, he had not been long at his perch, when a cry was\\r\\nheard\\xe2\\x80\\x94a cry and a rushing\\xe2\\x80\\x94and looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the\\r\\nair; and looking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the\\r\\nsea.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe life-buoy\\xe2\\x80\\x94a long slender cask\\xe2\\x80\\x94was dropped from the stern, where it always\\r\\nhung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to seize it, and the sun\\r\\nhaving long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so that it slowly filled, and\\r\\nthe parched wood also filled at its every pore; and the studded iron-bound cask\\r\\nfollowed the sailor to the bottom, as if to yield him his pillow, though in\\r\\nsooth but a hard one.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the\\r\\nWhite Whale, on the White Whale\\'s own peculiar ground; that man was swallowed\\r\\nup in the deep. But few, perhaps, thought of that at the time. Indeed, in some\\r\\nsort, they were not grieved at this event, at least as a portent; for they\\r\\nregarded it, not as a fore-shadowing of evil in the future, but as the\\r\\nfulfilment of an evil already presaged. They declared that now they knew the\\r\\nreason of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before. But again the old\\r\\nManxman said nay.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to see to it;\\r\\nbut as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and as in the feverish\\r\\neagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage, all hands were\\r\\nimpatient of any toil but what was directly connected with its final end,\\r\\nwhatever that might prove to be; therefore, they were going to leave the ship\\'s\\r\\nstern unprovided with a buoy, when by certain strange signs and inuendoes\\r\\nQueequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"A life-buoy of a coffin!\" cried Starbuck, starting.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Rather queer, that, I should say,\" said Stubb.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"It will make a good enough one,\" said Flask, \"the carpenter here can arrange\\r\\nit easily.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Bring it up; there\\'s nothing else for it,\" said Starbuck, after a melancholy\\r\\npause. \"Rig it, carpenter; do not look at me so\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the coffin, I mean. Dost thou\\r\\nhear me? Rig it.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"And shall I nail down the lid, sir?\" moving his hand as with a hammer.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Aye.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"And shall I caulk the seams, sir?\" moving his hand as with a caulking-iron.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Aye.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?\" moving his hand as with a\\r\\npitch-pot.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAway! What possesses thee to this? Make a life-buoy of the coffin, and no\\r\\nmore.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"He goes off in a huff. The whole he can endure; at the parts he baulks. Now I\\r\\ndon\\'t like this. I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he wears it like a\\r\\ngentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he won\\'t put his head into\\r\\nit. Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin? And now I\\'m ordered to\\r\\nmake a life-buoy of it. It\\'s like turning an old coat; going to bring the flesh\\r\\non the other side now. I don\\'t like this cobbling sort of business\\xe2\\x80\\x94 I don\\'t\\r\\nlike it at all; it\\'s undignified; it\\'s not my place. Let tinkers\\' brats do\\r\\ntinkerings; we are their betters. I like to take in hand none but clean,\\r\\nvirgin, fair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that regularly begins at\\r\\nthe beginning, and is at the middle when midway, and comes to an end at the\\r\\nconclusion; not a cobbler\\'s job, that\\'s at an end in the middle, and at the\\r\\nbeginning at the end. It\\'s the old woman\\'s tricks to be giving cobbling jobs.\\r\\nLord! what an affection all old women have for tinkers. I know an old woman of\\r\\nsixty-five who ran away with a bald-headed young tinker once. And that\\'s the\\r\\nreason I never would work for lonely widow old women ashore when I kept my\\r\\njob-shop in the Vineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads\\r\\nto run off with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let\\r\\nme see. Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with pitch;\\r\\nbatten them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over the ship\\'s stern.\\r\\nWere ever such things done before with a coffin? Some superstitious old\\r\\ncarpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging, ere they would do the job.\\r\\nBut I\\'m made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I don\\'t budge. Cruppered with a\\r\\ncoffin! Sailing about with a grave-yard tray! But never mind. We workers in\\r\\nwoods make bridal bedsteads and card-tables, as well as coffins and hearses. We\\r\\nwork by the month, or by the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask the why\\r\\nand wherefore of our work, unless it be too confounded cobbling, and then we\\r\\nstash it if we can. Hem! I\\'ll do the job, now, tenderly. I\\'ll have me\\xe2\\x80\\x94let\\'s\\r\\nsee\\xe2\\x80\\x94how many in the ship\\'s company, all told? But I\\'ve forgotten. Any way, I\\'ll\\r\\nhave me thirty separate, Turk\\'s-headed life-lines, each three feet long hanging\\r\\nall round to the coffin. Then, if the hull go down, there\\'ll be thirty lively\\r\\nfellows all fighting for one coffin, a sight not seen very often beneath the\\r\\nsun! Come hammer, caulking-iron, pitch-pot, and marling-spike!

At the time the Pequod\\r\\nwas making good speed through the water; but as the broad-winged windward\\r\\nstranger shot nigh to her, the boastful sails all fell together as blank\\r\\nbladders that are burst, and all life fled from the smitten hull.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Bad news; she brings bad news,\" muttered the old Manxman. But ere her\\r\\ncommander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere he could\\r\\nhopefully hail, Ahab\\'s voice was heard.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Hast seen the White Whale?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Aye, yesterday. Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThrottling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question; and\\r\\nwould then have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger captain himself,\\r\\nhaving stopped his vessel\\'s way, was seen descending her side. A few keen\\r\\npulls, and his boat-hook soon clinched the Pequod\\'s main-chains, and he sprang\\r\\nto the deck. Immediately he was recognized by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew.\\r\\nBut no formal salutation was exchanged.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Where was he?\\xe2\\x80\\x94not killed!\\xe2\\x80\\x94not killed!\" cried Ahab, closely advancing.<br>\\r\\n\"How was it?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous, while three\\r\\nof the stranger\\'s boats were engaged with a shoal of whales, which had led them\\r\\nsome four or five miles from the ship; and while they were yet in swift chase\\r\\nto windward, the white hump and head of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of\\r\\nthe blue water, not very far to leeward; whereupon, the fourth rigged boat\\xe2\\x80\\x94 a\\r\\nreserved one\\xe2\\x80\\x94had been instantly lowered in chase. After a keen sail before the\\r\\nwind, this fourth boat\\xe2\\x80\\x94the swiftest keeled of all\\xe2\\x80\\x94seemed to have succeeded in\\r\\nfastening\\xe2\\x80\\x94at least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell anything\\r\\nabout it. In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat; and then a swift\\r\\ngleam of bubbling white water; and after that nothing more; whence it was\\r\\nconcluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his\\r\\npursuers, as often happens. There was some apprehension, but no positive alarm,\\r\\nas yet. The recall signals were placed in the rigging; darkness came on; and\\r\\nforced to pick up her three far to windward boats\\xe2\\x80\\x94ere going in quest of the\\r\\nfourth one in the precisely opposite direction\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the ship had not only been\\r\\nnecessitated to leave that boat to its fate till near midnight, but, for the\\r\\ntime, to increase her distance from it. But the rest of her crew being at last\\r\\nsafe aboard, she crowded all sail\\xe2\\x80\\x94stunsail on stunsail\\xe2\\x80\\x94 after the missing boat;\\r\\nkindling a fire in her try-pots for a beacon; and every other man aloft on the\\r\\nlook-out. But though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the\\r\\npresumed place of the absent ones when last seen; though she then paused to\\r\\nlower her spare boats to pull all around her; and not finding anything, had\\r\\nagain dashed on; again paused, and lowered her boats; and though she had thus\\r\\ncontinued doing till daylight; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel\\r\\nhad been seen.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his object\\r\\nin boarding the Pequod. He desired that ship to unite with his own in the\\r\\nsearch; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart, on parallel\\r\\nlines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I will wager something now,\" whispered Stubb to Flask, \"that some one in that\\r\\nmissing boat wore off that Captain\\'s best coat; mayhap, his watch\\xe2\\x80\\x94 he\\'s so\\r\\ncursed anxious to get it back.

But the captain, for some unknown constitutional reason, had\\r\\nrefrained from mentioning all this, and not till forced to it by Ahab\\'s iciness\\r\\ndid he allude to his one yet missing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old,\\r\\nwhose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer\\'s\\r\\npaternal love, had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders\\r\\nof a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor does it\\r\\nunfrequently occur, that Nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age\\r\\naway from them, for a protracted three or four years\\' voyage in some other ship\\r\\nthan their own; so that their first knowledge of a whaleman\\'s career shall be\\r\\nunenervated by any chance display of a father\\'s natural but untimely\\r\\npartiality, or undue apprehensiveness and concern.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMeantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab; and Ahab\\r\\nstill stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without the least\\r\\nquivering of his own.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I will not go,\" said the stranger, \"till you say aye to me.

As the unsetting polar\\r\\nstar, which through the livelong, arctic, six months\\' night sustains its\\r\\npiercing, steady, central gaze; so Ahab\\'s purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon\\r\\nthe constant midnight of the gloomy crew. It domineered above them so, that all\\r\\ntheir bodings, doubts, misgivings, fears, were fain to hide beneath their\\r\\nsouls, and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn this foreshadowing interval, too, all humor, forced or natural, vanished.\\r\\nStubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more strove to check one.\\r\\nAlike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed ground to finest dust, and\\r\\npowdered, for the time, in the clamped mortar of Ahab\\'s iron soul. Like\\r\\nmachines, they dumbly moved about the deck, ever conscious that the old man\\'s\\r\\ndespot eye was on them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours when he\\r\\nthought no glance but one was on him; then you would have seen that even as\\r\\nAhab\\'s eyes so awed the crew\\'s, the inscrutable Parsee\\'s glance awed his; or\\r\\nsomehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affected it. Such an added,\\r\\ngliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah now; such ceaseless\\r\\nshudderings shook him; that the men looked dubious at him; half uncertain, as\\r\\nit seemed, whether indeed he were a mortal substance, or else a tremulous\\r\\nshadow cast upon the deck by some unseen being\\'s body. And that shadow was\\r\\nalways hovering there. For not by night, even, had Fedallah ever certainly been\\r\\nknown to slumber, or go below. He would stand still for hours: but never sat or\\r\\nleaned; his wan but wondrous eyes did plainly say\\xe2\\x80\\x94 We two watchmen never rest.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the deck,\\r\\nunless Ahab was before them; either standing in his pivot-hole, or exactly\\r\\npacing the planks between two undeviating limits,\\xe2\\x80\\x94the main-mast and the mizen;\\r\\nor else they saw him standing in the cabin-scuttle,\\xe2\\x80\\x94his living foot advanced\\r\\nupon the deck, as if to step; his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that\\r\\nhowever motionless he stood, however the days and nights were added on, that he\\r\\nhad not swung in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could\\r\\nnever tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at\\r\\ntimes; or whether he was still intently scanning them; no matter, though he\\r\\nstood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and the unheeded\\r\\nnight-damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat and hat. The\\r\\nclothes that the night had wet, the next day\\'s sunshine dried upon him; and so,\\r\\nday after day, and night after night; he went no more beneath the planks;\\r\\nwhatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,\\xe2\\x80\\x94 breakfast and\\r\\ndinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly grew all\\r\\ngnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still grow idly on at\\r\\nnaked base, though perished in the upper verdure. But though his whole life was\\r\\nnow become one watch on deck; and though the Parsee\\'s mystic watch was without\\r\\nintermission as his own; yet these two never seemed to speak\\xe2\\x80\\x94one man to the\\r\\nother\\xe2\\x80\\x94unless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it\\r\\nnecessary. Though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain;\\r\\nopenly, and to the awe-struck crew, they seemed pole-like asunder. If by day\\r\\nthey chanced to speak one word; by night, dumb men were both, so far as\\r\\nconcerned the slightest verbal interchange. At times, for longest hours,\\r\\nwithout a single hail, they stood far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his\\r\\nscuttle, the Parsee by the main-mast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other;\\r\\nas if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the Parsee his\\r\\nabandoned substance.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd yet, somehow, did Ahab\\xe2\\x80\\x94in his own proper self, as daily, hourly, and every\\r\\ninstant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Ahab seemed an independent\\r\\nlord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both seemed yoked together, and an\\r\\nunseen tyrant driving them; the lean shade siding the solid rib. For be this\\r\\nParsee what he may, all rib and keel was solid Ahab.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard from\\r\\naft,\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Man the mast-heads!\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94and all through the day, till after sunset and after\\r\\ntwilight, the same voice every hour, at the striking of the helmsman\\'s bell,\\r\\nwas heard\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"What d\\'ye see?\\xe2\\x80\\x94 sharp! sharp! sharp!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the children-seeking\\r\\nRachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the monomaniac old man seemed\\r\\ndistrustful of his crew\\'s fidelity; at least, of nearly all except the Pagan\\r\\nharpooneers; he seemed to doubt, even, whether Stubb and Flask might not\\r\\nwillingly overlook the sight he sought. But if these suspicions were really\\r\\nhis, he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them, however his\\r\\nactions might seem to hint them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I will have the first sight of the whale myself,\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94 he said. \"Aye! Ahab must\\r\\nhave the doubloon! and with his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed\\r\\nbowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved block, to secure to\\r\\nthe mainmast head, he received the two ends of the downwardreeved rope; and\\r\\nattaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end, in order to\\r\\nfasten it at the rail. This done, with that end yet in his hand and standing\\r\\nbeside the pin, he looked round upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other;\\r\\npausing his glance long upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah;\\r\\nand then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said,\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Take the\\r\\nrope, sir\\xe2\\x80\\x94I give it into thy hands, Starbuck.\" Then arranging his person in the\\r\\nbasket, he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch, Starbuck being the\\r\\none who secured the rope at last; and afterwards stood near it. And thus, with\\r\\none hand clinging round the royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for\\r\\nmiles and miles,\\xe2\\x80\\x94ahead astern, this side, and that,\\xe2\\x80\\x94within the wide expanded\\r\\ncircle commanded at so great a height.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the\\r\\nrigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is hoisted up\\r\\nto that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these circumstances, its\\r\\nfastened end on deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who has\\r\\nthe special watch of it. Because in such a wilderness of running rigging, whose\\r\\nvarious different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what\\r\\nis seen of them at the deck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being\\r\\nevery few minutes cast down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural\\r\\nfatality, if, unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor should by\\r\\nsome carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea.\\r\\nSo Ahab\\'s proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only strange thing\\r\\nabout them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man who had ever\\r\\nventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to\\r\\ndecision\\xe2\\x80\\x94 one of those too, whose faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to\\r\\ndoubt somewhat; it was strange, that this was the very man he should select for\\r\\nhis watchman; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted\\r\\nperson\\'s hands.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten minutes;\\r\\none of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly incommodiously\\r\\nclose round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these latitudes; one of these\\r\\nbirds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift\\r\\ncirclings. Then it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air; then\\r\\nspiralized downwards, and went eddying again round his head.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed not to\\r\\nmark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked it much, it\\r\\nbeing no uncommon circumstance; only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to\\r\\nsee some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Your hat, your hat, sir!\" suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who being posted\\r\\nat the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab, though somewhat lower than\\r\\nhis level, and with a deep gulf of air dividing them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut already the sable wing was before the old man\\'s eyes; the long hooked bill\\r\\nat his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted away with his prize.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAn eagle flew thrice round Tarquin\\'s head, removing his cap to replace it, and\\r\\nthereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin would be king of Rome. But\\r\\nonly by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good. Ahab\\'s hat was\\r\\nnever restored; the wild hawk flew on and on with it; far in advance of the\\r\\nprow: and at last disappeared; while from the point of that disappearance, a\\r\\nminute black spot was dimly discerned, falling from that vast height into the\\r\\nsea.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 131</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Pequod Meets The Delight\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the\\r\\nlife-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably misnamed\\r\\nthe Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were fixed upon her broad\\r\\nbeams, called shears, which, in some whaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at\\r\\nthe height of eight or nine feet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or\\r\\ndisabled boats.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nUpon the stranger\\'s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and some few\\r\\nsplintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you now saw through\\r\\nthis wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled, half-unhinged, and\\r\\nbleaching skeleton of a horse.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Hast seen the White Whale?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Look!\" replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and with his\\r\\ntrumpet he pointed to the wreck.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Hast killed him?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"The harpoon is not yet forged that will ever will do that,\" answered the\\r\\nother, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose gathered sides\\r\\nsome noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Not forged!\" and snatching Perth\\'s levelled iron from the crotch, Ahab held it\\r\\nout, exclaiming\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this hand I hold his death!\\r\\nTempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are these barbs; and I swear to\\r\\ntemper them triply in that hot place behind the fin, where the White Whale most\\r\\nfeels his accursed life!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Then God keep thee, old man\\xe2\\x80\\x94see\\'st thou that\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94 pointing to the hammock\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"I bury\\r\\nbut one of five stout men, who were alive only yesterday; but were dead ere\\r\\nnight.

The firmaments of air and sea were hardly\\r\\nseparable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was transparently\\r\\npure and soft, with a woman\\'s look, and the robust and man-like sea heaved with\\r\\nlong, strong, lingering swells, as Samson\\'s chest in his sleep.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small, unspeckled\\r\\nbirds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air; but to and fro in\\r\\nthe deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed mighty leviathans,\\r\\nsword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong, troubled, murderous\\r\\nthinkings of the masculine sea.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and shadows\\r\\nwithout; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it were, that\\r\\ndistinguished them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle air to\\r\\nthis bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom. And at the girdling line of\\r\\nthe horizon, a soft and tremulous motion\\xe2\\x80\\x94 most seen here at the Equator\\xe2\\x80\\x94denoted\\r\\nthe fond, throbbing trust, the loving alarms, with which the poor bride gave\\r\\nher bosom away.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly firm and\\r\\nunyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the ashes of ruin;\\r\\nuntottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn; lifting his\\r\\nsplintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl\\'s forehead of heaven.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure!

But the lovely aromas in that\\r\\nenchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a moment, the cankerous thing in\\r\\nhis soul. That glad, happy air, that winsome sky, did at last stroke and caress\\r\\nhim; the step-mother world, so long cruel\\xe2\\x80\\x94forbidding\\xe2\\x80\\x94now threw affectionate\\r\\narms round his stubborn neck, and did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over\\r\\none, that however wilful and erring, she could yet find it in her heart to save\\r\\nand to bless.

Sleeping?\\r\\nAye, toil we how we may, we all sleep at last on the field. Sleep?

He declared that a\\r\\nwhale must be near. Soon that peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance\\r\\ngiven forth by the living sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was\\r\\nany mariner surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the\\r\\ndog-vane, and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as\\r\\npossible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship\\'s course to be slightly altered, and\\r\\nthe sail to be shortened.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at\\r\\ndaybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise\\r\\nahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering\\r\\nit, the polished metallic-like marks of some swift tide-rip, at the mouth of a\\r\\ndeep, rapid stream.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Man the mast-heads! Call all hands!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle deck,\\r\\nDaggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they seemed to exhale\\r\\nfrom the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in\\r\\ntheir hands.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What d\\'ye see?\" cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Nothing, nothing sir!\" was the sound hailing down in reply.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"T\\'gallant sails!\\xe2\\x80\\x94stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAll sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for swaying him\\r\\nto the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were hoisting him\\r\\nthither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft, and while peering ahead\\r\\nthrough the horizontal vacancy between the main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail,\\r\\nhe raised a gull-like cry in the air. \"There she blows!\\xe2\\x80\\x94there she blows! A hump\\r\\nlike a snow-hill! It is Moby Dick!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three look-outs,\\r\\nthe men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so\\r\\nlong been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final perch, some feet above the\\r\\nother look-outs, Tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the\\r\\ntop-gallant-mast, so that the Indian\\'s head was almost on a level with Ahab\\'s\\r\\nheel. From this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every\\r\\nroll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his\\r\\nsilent spout into the air. To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent\\r\\nspout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"And did none of ye see it before?\" cried Ahab, hailing the perched men all\\r\\naround him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I cried\\r\\nout,\" said Tashtego.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Not the same instant; not the same\\xe2\\x80\\x94no, the doubloon is mine, Fate reserved the\\r\\ndoubloon for me. I only; none of ye could have raised the White Whale first.\\r\\nThere she blows! there she blows!\\xe2\\x80\\x94 there she blows!\\xe2\\x80\\x94there she blows! There\\r\\nagain!\\xe2\\x80\\x94there again!\" he cried, in long-drawn, lingering, methodic tones,\\r\\nattuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale\\'s visible jets. \"He\\'s going to\\r\\nsound! In stunsails! Down top-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats. Mr.\\r\\nStarbuck, remember, stay on board, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a\\r\\npoint! So; steady, man, steady! There go flukes! No, no; only black water! All\\r\\nready the boats there? Stand by, stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck; lower,\\r\\nlower,\\xe2\\x80\\x94quick, quicker!\" and he slid through the air to the deck.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"He is heading straight to leeward, sir,\" cried Stubb, \"right away from us;\\r\\ncannot have seen the ship yet.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Be dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!\\xe2\\x80\\x94brace up!<br>\\r\\nShiver her!\\xe2\\x80\\x94shiver her!\\xe2\\x80\\x94So; well that! Boats, boats!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSoon all the boats but Starbuck\\'s were dropped; all the boat-sails set\\xe2\\x80\\x94 all the\\r\\npaddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to leeward; and Ahab heading\\r\\nthe onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up Fedallah\\'s sunken eyes; a hideous\\r\\nmotion gnawed his mouth.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLike noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea; but\\r\\nonly slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew still more\\r\\nsmooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a noon-meadow, so\\r\\nserenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly\\r\\nunsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible,\\r\\nsliding along the sea as if an isolated thing, and continually set in a\\r\\nrevolving ring of finest, fleecy, greenish foam. He saw the vast, involved\\r\\nwrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft\\r\\nTurkish-rugged waters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky\\r\\nforehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and behind, the\\r\\nblue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady\\r\\nwake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side. But these\\r\\nwere broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowls softly feathering\\r\\nthe sea, alternate with their fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising\\r\\nfrom the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent\\r\\nlance projected from the white whale\\'s back; and at intervals one of the cloud\\r\\nof soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the\\r\\nfish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail feathers\\r\\nstreaming like pennons.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA gentle joyousness\\xe2\\x80\\x94a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested the\\r\\ngliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with ravished Europa\\r\\nclinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering eyes sideways intent upon\\r\\nthe maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness, rippling straight for the nuptial\\r\\nbower in Crete; not Jove, not that great majesty Supreme! did surpass the\\r\\nglorified White Whale as he so divinely swam.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOn each soft side\\xe2\\x80\\x94coincident with the parted swell, that but once leaving him\\r\\nthen flowed so wide away\\xe2\\x80\\x94on each bright side, the whale shed off enticings. No\\r\\nwonder there had been some among the hunters who namelessly transported and\\r\\nallured by all this serenity, had ventured to assail it; but had fatally found\\r\\nthat quietude but the vesture of tornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale!\\r\\nthou glidest on, to all who for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in\\r\\nthat same way thou mayst have bejuggled and destroyed before.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among waves\\r\\nwhose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby Dick moved on,\\r\\nstill withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged trunk, entirely\\r\\nhiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw. But soon the fore part of him\\r\\nslowly rose from the water; for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a\\r\\nhigh arch, like Virginia\\'s Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered\\r\\nflukes in the air, the grand god revealed himself, sounded and went out of\\r\\nsight. Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls\\r\\nlongingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWith oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift, the three\\r\\nboats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick\\'s reappearance.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"An hour,\" said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat\\'s stern; and he gazed beyond\\r\\nthe whale\\'s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing vacancies to\\r\\nleeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed whirling round in\\r\\nhis head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze now freshened; the sea began\\r\\nto swell.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"The birds!\\xe2\\x80\\x94the birds!\" cried Tashtego.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now all\\r\\nflying towards Ahab\\'s boat; and when within a few yards began fluttering over\\r\\nthe water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous, expectant cries. Their\\r\\nvision was keener than man\\'s; Ahab could discover no sign in the sea. But\\r\\nsuddenly as he peered down and down into its depths, he profoundly saw a white\\r\\nliving spot no bigger than a white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising,\\r\\nand magnifying as it rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed\\r\\ntwo long crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the\\r\\nundiscoverable bottom. It was Moby Dick\\'s open mouth and scrolled jaw; his\\r\\nvast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea. The\\r\\nglittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble tomb; and\\r\\ngiving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled the craft aside\\r\\nfrom this tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon Fedallah to change places\\r\\nwith him, went forward to the bows, and seizing Perth\\'s harpoon, commanded his\\r\\ncrew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis, its bow,\\r\\nby anticipation, was made to face the whale\\'s head while yet under water. But\\r\\nas if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that malicious intelligence\\r\\nascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted himself, as it were, in an instant,\\r\\nshooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThrough and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for an\\r\\ninstant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a biting shark\\r\\nslowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth, so that the long,\\r\\nnarrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air, and one of the\\r\\nteeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was\\r\\nwithin six inches of Ahab\\'s head, and reached higher than that. In this\\r\\nattitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her\\r\\nmouse. With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the\\r\\ntiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other\\'s heads to gain the uttermost\\r\\nstern.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the whale\\r\\ndallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his body being\\r\\nsubmerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from the bows, for the\\r\\nbows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while the other boats\\r\\ninvoluntarily paused, as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand, then it\\r\\nwas that monomaniac Ahab, furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe,\\r\\nwhich placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied\\r\\nwith all this, he seized the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove\\r\\nto wrench it from its gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from\\r\\nhim; the frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an\\r\\nenormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in twain, and\\r\\nlocked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the two floating\\r\\nwrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew at the\\r\\nstern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast to the oars to\\r\\nlash them across.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first to\\r\\nperceive the whale\\'s intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a movement\\r\\nthat loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand had made one final\\r\\neffort to push the boat out of the bite. But only slipping further into the\\r\\nwhale\\'s mouth, and tilting over sideways as it slipped, the boat had shaken off\\r\\nhis hold on the jaw; spilled him out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he\\r\\nfell flat-faced upon the sea.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nRipplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little distance,\\r\\nvertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the billows; and at\\r\\nthe same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body; so that when his vast\\r\\nwrinkled forehead rose\\xe2\\x80\\x94 some twenty or more feet out of the water\\xe2\\x80\\x94the now\\r\\nrising swells, with all their confluent waves, dazzlingly broke against it;\\r\\nvindictively tossing their shivered spray still higher into the air.* So, in a\\r\\ngale, the but half baffled Channel billows only recoil from the base of the\\r\\nEddystone, triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its designation\\r\\n(pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary up-and-down poise of\\r\\nthe whale-lance, in the exercise called pitchpoling, previously described. By\\r\\nthis motion the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever objects\\r\\nmay be encircling him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round and\\r\\nround the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake, as if\\r\\nlashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault. The sight of the\\r\\nsplintered boat seemed to madden him, as the blood of grapes and mulberries\\r\\ncast before Antiochus\\'s elephants in the book of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half\\r\\nsmothered in the foam of the whale\\'s insolent tail, and too much of a cripple\\r\\nto swim,\\xe2\\x80\\x94though he could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a\\r\\nwhirlpool as that; helpless Ahab\\'s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which\\r\\nthe least chance shock might burst. From the boat\\'s fragmentary stern, Fedallah\\r\\nincuriously and mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other drifting end,\\r\\ncould not succor him; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves.\\r\\nFor so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale\\'s aspect, and so planetarily\\r\\nswift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he seemed horizontally\\r\\nswooping upon them. And though the other boats, unharmed, still hovered hard\\r\\nby; still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike, lest that should be the\\r\\nsignal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all;\\r\\nnor in that case could they themselves hope to escape. With straining eyes,\\r\\nthen, they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose centre had now\\r\\nbecome the old man\\'s head.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMeantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship\\'s mast\\r\\nheads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene; and was now\\r\\nso nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Sail on the\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94 but that moment a\\r\\nbreaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and whelmed him for the time. But\\r\\nstruggling out of it again, and chancing to rise on a towering crest, he\\r\\nshouted,\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Sail on the whale!\\xe2\\x80\\x94Drive him off!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Pequod\\'s prows were pointed-, and breaking up the charmed circle, she\\r\\neffectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he sullenly swam off,\\r\\nthe boats flew to the rescue.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDragged into Stubb\\'s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white brine caking\\r\\nin his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab\\'s bodily strength did crack, and\\r\\nhelplessly he yielded to his body\\'s doom for a time, lying all crushed in the\\r\\nbottom of Stubb\\'s boat, like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants. Far\\r\\ninland, nameless wails came from him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more\\r\\nabbreviate it. In an instant\\'s compass, great hearts sometimes condense to one\\r\\ndeep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused through feebler\\r\\nmen\\'s whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary in each one suffering;\\r\\nstill, if the gods decree it, in their life-time aggregate a whole age of woe,\\r\\nwholly made up of instantaneous intensities; for even in their pointless\\r\\ncentres, those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior\\r\\nsouls.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"The harpoon,\" said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on one bended\\r\\narm\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"is it safe?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,\" said Stubb, showing it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Lay it before me;\\xe2\\x80\\x94any missing men?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"One, two, three, four, five;\\xe2\\x80\\x94there were five oars, sir, and here are five\\r\\nmen.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"That\\'s good.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so, I see him!<br>\\r\\nthere! there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!\\xe2\\x80\\x94<br>\\r\\nHands off from me! The eternal sap runs up in Ahab\\'s bones again!<br>\\r\\nSet the sail; out oars; the helm!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked up by\\r\\nanother boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is thus continued\\r\\nwith what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now. But the added power of\\r\\nthe boat did not equal the added power of the whale, for he seemed to have\\r\\ntreble-banked his every fin; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed,\\r\\nthat if now, under these circumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an\\r\\nindefinitely prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so\\r\\nlong a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing\\r\\nbarely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude. The ship itself, then, as\\r\\nit sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate means of\\r\\novertaking the chase. Accordingly, the boats now made for her, and were soon\\r\\nswayed up to their cranes\\xe2\\x80\\x94the two parts of the wrecked boat having been\\r\\npreviously secured by her\\xe2\\x80\\x94and then hoisting everything to her side, and\\r\\nstacking her canvas high up, and sideways outstretching it with stunsails, like\\r\\nthe double-jointed wings of an albatross; the Pequod bore down in the leeward\\r\\nwake of Moby Dick. At the well known, methodic intervals, the whale\\'s\\r\\nglittering spout was regularly announced from the manned mast-heads; and when\\r\\nhe would be reported as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then\\r\\npacing the deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the\\r\\nallotted hour expired, his voice was heard.\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Whose is the doubloon now? D\\'ye\\r\\nsee him?\" and if the reply was No, sir! straightway he commanded them to lift\\r\\nhim to his perch. In this way the day wore on; Ahab, now aloft and motionless;\\r\\nanon, unrestingly pacing the planks.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men aloft, or to\\r\\nbid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a still greater\\r\\nbreadth\\xe2\\x80\\x94thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat, at every turn he\\r\\npassed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped upon the quarter-deck, and\\r\\nlay there reversed; broken bow to shattered stern. At last he paused before it;\\r\\nand as in an already over-clouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes\\r\\nsail across, so over the old man\\'s face there now stole some such added gloom\\r\\nas this.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nStubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to evince his\\r\\nown unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place in his Captain\\'s mind,\\r\\nhe advanced, and eyeing the wreck exclaimed\\xe2\\x80\\x94 \"The thistle the ass refused; it\\r\\npricked his mouth too keenly, sir; ha! ha! ha!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck?<br>\\r\\nMan, man! did I not know thee brave as fearless fire<br>\\r\\n(and as mechanical) I could swear thou wert a poltroon.<br>\\r\\nGroan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Aye, sir,\" said Starbuck drawing near, \"\\'tis a solemn sight; an omen, and an\\r\\nill one.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Omen? omen?\\xe2\\x80\\x94the dictionary!

Away now! the deck is thine, sir!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and slouching his\\r\\nhat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals rousing himself to see how\\r\\nthe night wore on.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 134</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Chase - Second Day\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"D\\'ye see him?\" cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light to\\r\\nspread.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"See nothing, sir.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought for;\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the\\r\\ntop-gallant sails!\\xe2\\x80\\x94aye, they should have been kept on her all night. But no\\r\\nmatter\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\'tis but resting for the rush.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHere be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale,\\r\\ncontinued through day into night, and through night into day, is a thing by no\\r\\nmeans unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is the wonderful skill,\\r\\nprescience of experience, and invincible confidence acquired by some great\\r\\nnatural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders; that from the simple\\r\\nobservation of a whale when last descried, they will, under certain given\\r\\ncircumstances, pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will\\r\\ncontinue to swim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his probable rate\\r\\nof progression during that period. And, in these cases, somewhat as a pilot,\\r\\nwhen about losing sight of a coast, whose general trending he well knows, and\\r\\nwhich he desires shortly to return to again, but at some further point; like as\\r\\nthis pilot stands by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the cape at\\r\\npresent visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen\\r\\nheadland, eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman, at his compass, with\\r\\nthe whale; for after being chased, and diligently marked, through several hours\\r\\nof daylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the creature\\'s future wake\\r\\nthrough the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the\\r\\nhunter, as the pilot\\'s coast is to him. So that to this hunter\\'s wondrous\\r\\nskill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water, a wake, is to all\\r\\ndesired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land. And as the mighty\\r\\niron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in its every pace,\\r\\nthat, with watches in their hands, men time his rate as doctors that of a\\r\\nbaby\\'s pulse; and lightly say of it, the up train or the down train will reach\\r\\nsuch or such a spot, at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are\\r\\noccasions when these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep,\\r\\naccording to the observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so many\\r\\nhours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have about\\r\\nreached this or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to render this\\r\\nacuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the sea must be the\\r\\nwhaleman\\'s allies; for of what present avail to the becalmed or wind-bound\\r\\nmariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a\\r\\nquarter from his port? Inferable from these statements, are many collateral\\r\\nsubtile matters touching the chase of whales.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannonball,\\r\\nmissent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level field.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"By salt and hemp!\" cried Stubb, \"but this swift motion of the deck creeps up\\r\\none\\'s legs and tingles at the heart. This ship and I are two brave fellows!\\xe2\\x80\\x94Ha,\\r\\nha! Some one take me up, and launch me, spine-wise, on the sea,\\xe2\\x80\\x94for by\\r\\nlive-oaks! my spine\\'s a keel.

The frenzies of the\\r\\nchase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine worked anew.\\r\\nWhatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt before; these\\r\\nwere not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of Ahab, but they\\r\\nwere broken up, and on all sides routed, as timid prairie hares that scatter\\r\\nbefore the bounding bison. The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls; and\\r\\nby the stirring perils of the previous day; the rack of the past night\\'s\\r\\nsuspense; the fixed, unfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft\\r\\nwent plunging towards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were\\r\\nbowled along. The wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the\\r\\nvessel on by arms invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of that\\r\\nunseen agency which so enslaved them to the race.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them all; though\\r\\nit was put together of all contrasting things\\xe2\\x80\\x94oak, and maple, and pine wood;\\r\\niron, and pitch, and hemp\\xe2\\x80\\x94yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete\\r\\nhull, which shot on its way, both balanced and directed by the long central\\r\\nkeel; even so, all the individualities of the crew, this man\\'s valor, that\\r\\nman\\'s fear; guilt and guiltiness, all varieties were welded into oneness, and\\r\\nwere all directed to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did\\r\\npoint to.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were\\r\\noutspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one hand,\\r\\nsome reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others, shading their eyes\\r\\nfrom the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking yards; all the spars in\\r\\nfull bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for their fate. Ah! how they still\\r\\nstrove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy\\r\\nthem!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?\" cried Ahab, when, after the lapse\\r\\nof some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard. \"Sway me up, men;\\r\\nye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd jet that way, and then\\r\\ndisappears.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some other\\r\\nthing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for hardly had Ahab\\r\\nreached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck, when he\\r\\nstruck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the air vibrate as with the\\r\\ncombined discharge of rifles. The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs\\r\\nwas heard, as\\xe2\\x80\\x94 much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet,\\r\\nless than a mile ahead\\xe2\\x80\\x94Moby Dick bodily burst into view! For not by any calm\\r\\nand indolent spoutings; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in\\r\\nhis head, did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more\\r\\nwondrous phenomenon of breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the\\r\\nfurthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure\\r\\nelement of air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to\\r\\nthe distance of seven miles and more. In those moments, the torn, enraged waves\\r\\nhe shakes off, seem his mane; in some cases, this breaching is his act of\\r\\ndefiance.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"There she breaches! there she breaches!\" was the cry, as in his immeasurable\\r\\nbravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to Heaven. So suddenly\\r\\nseen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved against the still bluer margin\\r\\nof the sky, the spray that he raised, for the moment, intolerably glittered and\\r\\nglared like a glacier; and stood there gradually fading and fading away from\\r\\nits first sparkling intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a\\r\\nvale.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!\" cried Ahab, \"thy hour and thy\\r\\nharpoon are at hand!\\xe2\\x80\\x94Down! down all of ye, but one man at the fore. The\\r\\nboats!\\xe2\\x80\\x94stand by!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nUnmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like shooting\\r\\nstars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and halyards; while Ahab,\\r\\nless dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped from his perch.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Lower away,\" he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat\\xe2\\x80\\x94a spare one, rigged\\r\\nthe afternoon previous. \"Mr. Starbuck, the ship is thine\\xe2\\x80\\x94 keep away from the\\r\\nboats, but keep near them. Lower, all!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first\\r\\nassailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the three\\r\\ncrews. Ahab\\'s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told them he would\\r\\ntake the whale head-and-head,\\xe2\\x80\\x94 that is, pull straight up to his forehead,\\xe2\\x80\\x94a not\\r\\nuncommon thing; for when within a certain limit, such a course excludes the\\r\\ncoming onset from the whale\\'s sidelong vision. But ere that close limit was\\r\\ngained, and while yet all three boats were plain as the ship\\'s three masts to\\r\\nhis eye; the White Whale churning himself into furious speed, almost in an\\r\\ninstant as it were, rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail,\\r\\noffered appalling battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him\\r\\nfrom every boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of\\r\\nwhich those boats were made. But skilfully manoeuvred, incessantly wheeling\\r\\nlike trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while eluded him; though,\\r\\nat times, but by a plank\\'s breadth; while all the time, Ahab\\'s unearthly slogan\\r\\ntore every other cry but his to shreds.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed and\\r\\nrecrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines now\\r\\nfast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves, warped the devoted\\r\\nboats towards the planted irons in him; though now for a moment the whale drew\\r\\naside a little, as if to rally for a more tremendous charge. Seizing that\\r\\nopportunity, Ahab first paid out more line; and then was rapidly hauling and\\r\\njerking in upon it again\\xe2\\x80\\x94 hoping that way to disencumber it of some snarls\\xe2\\x80\\x94when\\r\\nlo!\\xe2\\x80\\x94 a sight more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCaught and twisted\\xe2\\x80\\x94corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons and\\r\\nlances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing and dripping\\r\\nup to the chocks in the bows of Ahab\\'s boat. Only one thing could be done.\\r\\nSeizing the boat-knife, he critically reached within\\xe2\\x80\\x94through\\xe2\\x80\\x94and then,\\r\\nwithout\\xe2\\x80\\x94the rays of steel; dragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to\\r\\nthe bowsman, and then, twice sundering the rope near the chocks\\xe2\\x80\\x94dropped the\\r\\nintercepted fagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again. That instant,\\r\\nthe White Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other\\r\\nlines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and\\r\\nFlask towards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a\\r\\nsurf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a boiling\\r\\nmaelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced\\r\\nround and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhile the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after the\\r\\nrevolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while aslope little\\r\\nFlask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching his legs upwards to\\r\\nescape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was lustily singing out for some\\r\\none to ladle him up; and while the old man\\'s line\\xe2\\x80\\x94now parting\\xe2\\x80\\x94admitted of his\\r\\npulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he could;\\xe2\\x80\\x94 in that wild\\r\\nsimultaneousness of a thousand concreted perils,\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Ahab\\'s yet unstricken boat\\r\\nseemed drawn up towards Heaven by invisible wires,\\xe2\\x80\\x94as, arrow-like, shooting\\r\\nperpendicularly from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against\\r\\nits bottom, and sent it turning over and over, into the air; till it fell\\r\\nagain\\xe2\\x80\\x94 gunwale downwards\\xe2\\x80\\x94and Ahab and his men struggled out from under it, like\\r\\nseals from a sea-side cave.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe first uprising momentum of the whale\\xe2\\x80\\x94modifying its direction as he struck\\r\\nthe surface\\xe2\\x80\\x94involuntarily launched him along it, to a little distance from the\\r\\ncentre of the destruction he had made; and with his back to it, he now lay for\\r\\na moment slowly feeling with his flukes from side to side; and whenever a stray\\r\\noar, bit of plank, the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his\\r\\ntail swiftly drew back, and came sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if\\r\\nsatisfied that his work for that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead\\r\\nthrough the ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his\\r\\nleeward way at a traveller\\'s methodic pace.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again came\\r\\nbearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the floating\\r\\nmariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at, and safely landed\\r\\nthem on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists, and ankles; livid\\r\\ncontusions; wrenched harpoons and lances; inextricable intricacies of rope;\\r\\nshattered oars and planks; all these were there; but no fatal or even serious\\r\\nill seemed to have befallen any one. As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab\\r\\nwas now found grimly clinging to his boat\\'s broken half, which afforded a\\r\\ncomparatively easy float; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day\\'s\\r\\nmishap.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as instead\\r\\nof standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of Starbuck, who\\r\\nhad thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory leg had been snapped\\r\\noff, leaving but one short sharp splinter.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Aye, aye, Starbuck, \\'tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he will;\\r\\nand would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"The ferrule has not stood, sir,\" said the carpenter, now coming up;<br>\\r\\nI put good work into that leg.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"But no bones broken, sir, I hope,\" said Stubb with true concern.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!\\xe2\\x80\\x94d\\'ye see it.\\xe2\\x80\\x94 But even with a broken\\r\\nbone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living bone of mine one jot more\\r\\nme, than this dead one that\\'s lost. Nor white whale, nor man, nor fiend, can so\\r\\nmuch as graze old Ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being. Can any lead\\r\\ntouch yonder floor, any mast scrape yonder roof?\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Aloft there! which way?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Dead to leeward, sir.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest of the\\r\\nspare boats and rig them\\xe2\\x80\\x94Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the boat\\'s crews.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed fate! that the\\r\\nunconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Sir?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"My body, man, not thee.

Meantime, of the broken keel of Ahab\\'s wrecked craft the carpenter made\\r\\nhim another leg; while still as on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed\\r\\nwithin his scuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on\\r\\nits dial; sat due eastward for the earliest sun.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2>CHAPTER 135</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Chase - Third Day\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the solitary\\r\\nnight-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the daylight\\r\\nlook-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"D\\'ye see him?\" cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that\\'s all.

And\\r\\nyet, \\'tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind! who ever conquered it? In every\\r\\nfight it has the last and bitterest blow. Run tilting at it, and you but run\\r\\nthrough it. Ha! a coward wind that strikes stark naked men, but will not stand\\r\\nto receive a single blow. Even Ahab is a braver thing\\xe2\\x80\\x94a nobler thing than that.\\r\\nWould now the wind but had a body; but all the things that most exasperate and\\r\\noutrage mortal man, all these things are bodiless, but only bodiless as\\r\\nobjects, not as agents. There\\'s a most special, a most cunning, oh, a most\\r\\nmalicious difference! And yet, I say again, and swear it now, that there\\'s\\r\\nsomething all glorious and gracious in the wind. These warm Trade Winds, at\\r\\nleast, that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in strong and steadfast,\\r\\nvigorous mildness; and veer not from their mark, however the baser currents of\\r\\nthe sea may turn and tack, and mightiest Mississippies of the land swift and\\r\\nswerve about, uncertain where to go at last. And by the eternal Poles! these\\r\\nsame Trades that so directly blow my good ship on; these Trades, or something\\r\\nlike them\\xe2\\x80\\x94something so unchangeable, and full as strong, blow my keeled soul\\r\\nalong! To it! Aloft there! What d\\'ye see?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Nothing, sir.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Nothing! and noon at hand! The doubloon goes a-begging! See the sun! Aye, aye,\\r\\nit must be so. I\\'ve over-sailed him. How, got the start? Aye, he\\'s chasing me\\r\\nnow; not I, him\\xe2\\x80\\x94 that\\'s bad; I might have known it, too. Fool! the lines\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the\\r\\nharpoons he\\'s towing. Aye, aye, I have run him by last night. About! about!\\r\\nCome down, all of ye, but the regular look outs! Man the braces!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSteering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod\\'s quarter,\\r\\nso that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the braced ship sailed hard\\r\\nupon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own white wake.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw,\" murmured Starbuck to\\r\\nhimself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail. \"God keep us,\\r\\nbut already my bones feel damp within me, and from the inside wet my flesh. I\\r\\nmisdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Stand by to sway me up!\" cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket.<br>\\r\\n\"We should meet him soon.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" and straightway Starbuck did Ahab\\'s bidding, and once more\\r\\nAhab swung on high.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. Time itself now held long\\r\\nbreaths with keen suspense. But at last, some three points off the weather bow,\\r\\nAhab descried the spout again, and instantly from the three mast-heads three\\r\\nshrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick! On deck\\r\\nthere!\\xe2\\x80\\x94brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind\\'s eye. He\\'s too far off to\\r\\nlower yet, Mr. Starbuck. The sails shake! Stand over that helmsman with a\\r\\ntop-maul! So, so; he travels fast, and I must down. But let me have one more\\r\\ngood round look aloft here at the sea; there\\'s time for that. An old, old\\r\\nsight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and not changed a wink since I first saw\\r\\nit, a boy, from the sand-hills of Nantucket! The same\\xe2\\x80\\x94the same!\\xe2\\x80\\x94 the same to\\r\\nNoah as to me. There\\'s a soft shower to leeward. Such lovely leewardings! They\\r\\nmust lead somewhere\\xe2\\x80\\x94 to something else than common land, more palmy than the\\r\\npalms. Leeward! the white whale goes that way; look to windward, then; the\\r\\nbetter if the bitterer quarter. But good bye, good bye, old mast-head! What\\'s\\r\\nthis?\\xe2\\x80\\x94green? aye, tiny mosses in these warped cracks. No such green weather\\r\\nstains on Ahab\\'s head! There\\'s the difference now between man\\'s old age and\\r\\nmatter\\'s. But aye, old mast, we both grow old together; sound in our hulls,\\r\\nthough are we not, my ship? Aye, minus a leg, that\\'s all. By heaven this dead\\r\\nwood has the better of my live flesh every way. I can\\'t compare with it; and\\r\\nI\\'ve known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the\\r\\nmost vital stuff of vital fathers. What\\'s that he said? he should still go\\r\\nbefore me, my pilot; and yet to be seen again? But where? Will I have eyes at\\r\\nthe bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs? and all night\\r\\nI\\'ve been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to. Aye, aye, like many more\\r\\nthou told\\'st direful truth as touching thyself, O Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy\\r\\nshot fell short. Good bye, mast-head\\xe2\\x80\\x94keep a good eye upon the whale, the while\\r\\nI\\'m gone. We\\'ll talk to-morrow, nay, to-night, when the white whale lies down\\r\\nthere, tied by head and tail.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered through the\\r\\ncloven blue air to the deck.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallop\\'s stern,\\r\\nAhab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to the mate,\\xe2\\x80\\x94who held\\r\\none of the tackle\\xe2\\x80\\x94ropes on deck\\xe2\\x80\\x94 and bade him pause.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Starbuck!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Sir?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"For the third time my soul\\'s ship starts upon this voyage, Starbuck.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Aye, sir, thou wilt have it so.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing, Starbuck!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Truth, sir: saddest truth.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the\\r\\nflood;\\xe2\\x80\\x94and I feel now like a billow that\\'s all one crested comb, Starbuck. I am\\r\\nold;\\xe2\\x80\\x94shake hands with me, man.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTheir hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck\\'s tears the glue.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Oh, my captain, my captain!\\xe2\\x80\\x94noble heart\\xe2\\x80\\x94go not\\xe2\\x80\\x94go not!\\xe2\\x80\\x94see, it\\'s a brave man\\r\\nthat weeps; how great the agony of the persuasion then!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Lower away!\"-cried Ahab, tossing the mate\\'s arm from him.<br>\\r\\n\"Stand by for the crew!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"The sharks! the sharks!\" cried a voice from the low cabin-window there;<br>\\r\\n\"O master, my master, come back!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and the boat\\r\\nleaped on.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nYet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when numbers\\r\\nof sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the hull,\\r\\nmaliciously snapped at the blades of the oars, every time they dipped in the\\r\\nwater; and in this way accompanied the boat with their bites. It is a thing not\\r\\nuncommonly happening to the whale-boats in those swarming seas; the sharks at\\r\\ntimes apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover\\r\\nover the banners of marching regiments in the east. But these were the first\\r\\nsharks that had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been\\r\\nfirst descried; and whether it was that Ahab\\'s crew were all such tiger-yellow\\r\\nbarbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharks\\xe2\\x80\\x94 a\\r\\nmatter sometimes well known to affect them,\\xe2\\x80\\x94however it was, they seemed to\\r\\nfollow that one boat without molesting the others.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Heart of wrought steel!\" murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and following\\r\\nwith his eyes the receding boat\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"canst thou yet ring boldly to that\\r\\nsight?\\xe2\\x80\\x94lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and followed by them,\\r\\nopen-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical third day?\\xe2\\x80\\x94For when three days\\r\\nflow together in one continuous intense pursuit; be sure the first is the\\r\\nmorning, the second the noon, and the third the evening and the end of that\\r\\nthing\\xe2\\x80\\x94be that end what it may. Oh! my God! what is this that shoots through me,\\r\\nand leaves me so deadly calm, yet expectant,\\xe2\\x80\\x94fixed at the top of a shudder!\\r\\nFuture things swim before me, as in empty outlines and skeletons; all the past\\r\\nis somehow grown dim. Mary, girl; thou fadest in pale glories behind me; boy! I\\r\\nseem to see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life seem\\r\\nclearing; but clouds sweep between\\xe2\\x80\\x94Is my journey\\'s end coming? My legs feel\\r\\nfaint; like his who has footed it all day. Feel thy heart,\\xe2\\x80\\x94beats it yet? Stir\\r\\nthyself, Starbuck!\\xe2\\x80\\x94 stave it off\\xe2\\x80\\x94move, move! speak aloud!\\xe2\\x80\\x94Mast-head there! See\\r\\nye my boy\\'s hand on the hill?\\xe2\\x80\\x94Crazed; aloft there!\\xe2\\x80\\x94 keep thy keenest eye upon\\r\\nthe boats:\\xe2\\x80\\x94mark well the whale!\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Ho! again!\\xe2\\x80\\x94drive off that hawk! see! he\\r\\npecks\\xe2\\x80\\x94he tears the vane\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94 pointing to the red flag flying at the\\r\\nmain-truck\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Ha, he soars away with it!\\xe2\\x80\\x94Where\\'s the old man now? see\\'st thou\\r\\nthat sight, oh Ahab!\\xe2\\x80\\x94shudder, shudder!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mast-heads\\xe2\\x80\\x94 a\\r\\ndownward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had sounded; but intending to be\\r\\nnear him at the next rising, he held on his way a little sideways from the\\r\\nvessel; the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence, as the\\r\\nhead-bent waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads drive them\\r\\nin! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and no hearse can be\\r\\nmine:\\xe2\\x80\\x94and hemp only can kill me! Ha! ha!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSuddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then quickly\\r\\nupheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice, swiftly rising\\r\\nto the surface. A low rumbling sound was heard; a subterraneous hum; and then\\r\\nall held their breaths; as bedraggled with trailing ropes, and harpoons, and\\r\\nlances, a vast form shot lengthwise, but obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a\\r\\nthin drooping veil of mist, it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and\\r\\nthen fell swamping back into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters\\r\\nflashed for an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower\\r\\nof flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble\\r\\ntrunk of the whale.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Give way!\" cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to the\\r\\nattack; but maddened by yesterday\\'s fresh irons that corroded in him, Moby Dick\\r\\nseemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven. The wide\\r\\ntiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead, beneath the\\r\\ntransparent skin, looked knitted together; as head on, he came churning his\\r\\ntail among the boats; and once more flailed them apart; spilling out the irons\\r\\nand lances from the two mates\\' boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part\\r\\nof their bows, but leaving Ahab\\'s almost without a scar.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhile Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the whale\\r\\nswimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he shot by them\\r\\nagain; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round and round to the fish\\'s\\r\\nback; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which, during the past night, the\\r\\nwhale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him, the half torn body of\\r\\nthe Parsee was seen; his sable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes\\r\\nturned full upon old Ahab.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe harpoon dropped from his hand.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Befooled, befooled!\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94drawing in a long lean breath\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Aye, Parsee! I see thee\\r\\nagain.\\xe2\\x80\\x94Aye, and thou goest before; and this, this then is the hearse that thou\\r\\ndidst promise. But I hold thee to the last letter of thy word. Where is the\\r\\nsecond hearse? Away, mates, to the ship! those boats are useless now; repair\\r\\nthem if ye can in time, and return to me; if not, Ahab is enough to die\\xe2\\x80\\x94Down,\\r\\nmen! the first thing that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that\\r\\nthing I harpoon. Ye are not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey\\r\\nme.\\xe2\\x80\\x94 Where\\'s the whale? gone down again?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the corpse\\r\\nhe bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a\\r\\nstage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again steadily swimming forward;\\r\\nand had almost passed the ship,\\xe2\\x80\\x94which thus far had been sailing in the contrary\\r\\ndirection to him, though for the present her headway had been stopped. He\\r\\nseemed swimming with his utmost velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing his\\r\\nown straight path in the sea.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Oh! Ahab,\" cried Starbuck, \"not too late is it, even now, the third day, to\\r\\ndesist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that madly seekest\\r\\nhim!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSetting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to\\r\\nleeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was sliding by the\\r\\nvessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck\\'s face as he leaned over the\\r\\nrail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and follow him, not too swiftly,\\r\\nat a judicious interval. Glancing upwards he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and\\r\\nDaggoo, eagerly mounting to the three mast-heads; while the oarsmen were\\r\\nrocking in the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side,\\r\\nand were busily at work in repairing them. One after the other, through the\\r\\nport-holes, as he sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask,\\r\\nbusying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances. As he saw all\\r\\nthis; as he heard the hammers in the broken boats; far other hammers seemed\\r\\ndriving a nail into his heart. But he rallied. And now marking that the vane or\\r\\nflag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had just\\r\\ngained that perch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer and nails,\\r\\nand so nail it to the mast.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhether fagged by the three days\\' running chase, and the resistance to his\\r\\nswimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some latent\\r\\ndeceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White Whale\\'s way now\\r\\nbegan to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more;\\r\\nthough indeed the whale\\'s last start had not been so long a one as before. And\\r\\nstill as Ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him; and\\r\\nso pertinaciously stuck to the boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars,\\r\\nthat the blades became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the\\r\\nsea, at almost every dip.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars.<br>\\r\\nPull on! \\'tis the better rest, the sharks\\' jaw than the yielding water.\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"They will last long enough! pull on!\\xe2\\x80\\x94But who can tell\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94 he muttered\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"whether\\r\\nthese sharks swim to feast on the whale or on Ahab?\\xe2\\x80\\x94But pull on! Aye, all\\r\\nalive, now\\xe2\\x80\\x94we near him. The helm! take the helm! let me pass,\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94and so saying\\r\\ntwo of the oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still flying boat.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along with the\\r\\nWhite Whale\\'s flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its advance\\xe2\\x80\\x94as the whale\\r\\nsometimes will\\xe2\\x80\\x94and Ahab was fairly within the smoky mountain mist, which,\\r\\nthrown off from the whale\\'s spout, curled round his great Monadnock hump; he\\r\\nwas even thus close to him; when, with body arched back, and both arms\\r\\nlengthwise high-lifted to the poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far\\r\\nfiercer curse into the hated whale. As both steel and curse sank to the socket,\\r\\nas if sucked into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled\\r\\nhis nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so suddenly\\r\\ncanted the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale\\r\\nto which he then clung, Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea. As\\r\\nit was, three of the oarsmen\\xe2\\x80\\x94who foreknew not the precise instant of the dart,\\r\\nand were therefore unprepared for its effects\\xe2\\x80\\x94 these were flung out; but so\\r\\nfell, that, in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to\\r\\nits level on a combing wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third\\r\\nman helplessly dropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAlmost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated, instantaneous\\r\\nswiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering sea. But when Ahab\\r\\ncried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line, and hold it so; and\\r\\ncommanded the crew to turn round on their seats, and tow the boat up to the\\r\\nmark; the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug, it\\r\\nsnapped in the empty air!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"What breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\'tis whole again; oars! oars!<br>\\r\\nBurst in upon him!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled round\\r\\nto present his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution, catching sight of\\r\\nthe nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing in it the source of all\\r\\nhis persecutions; bethinking it\\xe2\\x80\\x94it may be\\xe2\\x80\\x94a larger and nobler foe; of a sudden,\\r\\nhe bore down upon its advancing prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of\\r\\nfoam.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAhab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. \"I grow blind; hands! stretch out\\r\\nbefore me that I may yet grope my way. Is\\'t night?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"The whale! The ship!\" cried the cringing oarsmen.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"Oars! oars! Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea that ere it be for ever too\\r\\nlate, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark! I see: the ship! the\\r\\nship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the sledge-hammering\\r\\nseas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks burst through, and in an\\r\\ninstant almost, the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves;\\r\\nits half-wading, splashing crew, trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the\\r\\npouring water.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMeantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego\\'s mast-head hammer remained\\r\\nsuspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him as with a plaid,\\r\\nthen streamed itself straight out from him, as his own forward-flowing heart;\\r\\nwhile Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the bowsprit beneath, caught sight of\\r\\nthe down-coming monster just as soon as he.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"The whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers of air, now\\r\\nhug me close!

And now poor\\r\\nStubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft; would it were stuffed\\r\\nwith brushwood! I grin at thee, thou grinning whale! Look ye, sun, moon, and\\r\\nstars!

Some fell flat\\r\\nupon their faces. Like dislodged trucks, the heads of the harpooneers aloft\\r\\nshook on their bull-like necks. Through the breach, they heard the waters pour,\\r\\nas mountain torrents down a flume.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"The ship! The hearse!\\xe2\\x80\\x94the second hearse!\" cried Ahab from the boat; \"its wood\\r\\ncould only be American!\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDiving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its keel; but\\r\\nturning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far off the other bow,\\r\\nbut within a few yards of Ahab\\'s boat, where, for a time, he lay quiescent.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\"I turn my body from the sun.

And now, concentric circles seized the lone boat itself,\\r\\nand all its crew, and each floating oar, and every lancepole, and spinning,\\r\\nanimate and inanimate, all round and round in one vortex, carried the smallest\\r\\nchip of the Pequod out of sight.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head\\r\\nof the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet\\r\\nvisible, together with long streaming yards of the flag, which calmly\\r\\nundulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying billows they almost\\r\\ntouched;\\xe2\\x80\\x94at that instant, a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in\\r\\nthe open air, in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the\\r\\nsubsiding spar. A sky-hawk that tauntingly had followed the main-truck\\r\\ndownwards from its natural home among the stars, pecking at the flag, and\\r\\nincommoding Tashtego there; this bird now chanced to intercept its broad\\r\\nfluttering wing between the hammer and the wood; and simultaneously feeling\\r\\nthat etherial thrill, the submerged savage beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his\\r\\nhammer frozen there; and so the bird of heaven, with archangelic shrieks, and\\r\\nhis imperial beak thrust upwards, and his whole captive form folded in the flag\\r\\nof Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like Satan, would not sink to hell\\r\\ntill she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her, and helmeted\\r\\nherself with it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen white surf\\r\\nbeat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the great shroud of the\\r\\nsea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEpilogue\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\"AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE\"<br>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0Job.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe drama\\'s done.

So, floating on the margin of the\\r\\nensuing scene, and in full sight of it, when the halfspent suction of the sunk\\r\\nship reached me, I was then, but slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex. When\\r\\nI reached it, it had subsided to a creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever\\r\\ncontracting towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly\\r\\nwheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that vital\\r\\ncentre, the black bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by reason of its\\r\\ncunning spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising with great force, the\\r\\ncoffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and floated by my\\r\\nside. Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost one whole day and night, I floated\\r\\non a soft and dirgelike main. The unharming sharks, they glided by as if with\\r\\npadlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks. On\\r\\nthe second day, a sail drew near, nearer, and picked me up at last. It was the\\r\\ndevious-cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search after her missing\\r\\nchildren, only found another orphan.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2> ETYMOLOGY</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n(Supplied by a Late Consumptive Usher to a Grammar School)\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe pale Usher\\xe2\\x80\\x94threadbare in coat, heart, body, and brain; I see him now.

style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nThe Mountain\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie was the son of Peter the miner.  He lived with his father and\\r\\nmother in a cottage built on a mountain, and he worked with his father\\r\\ninside the mountain.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA mountain is a strange and awful thing.  In old times, without knowing\\r\\nso much of their strangeness and awfulness as we do, people were yet\\r\\nmore afraid of mountains.  But then somehow they had not come to see\\r\\nhow beautiful they are as well as awful, and they hated them\\xe2\\x80\\x94and what\\r\\npeople hate they must fear.  Now that we have learned to look at them\\r\\nwith admiration, perhaps we do not feel quite awe enough of them.  To\\r\\nme they are beautiful terrors.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI will try to tell you what they are.  They are portions of the heart\\r\\nof the earth that have escaped from the dungeon down below, and rushed\\r\\nup and out.  For the heart of the earth is a great wallowing mass, not\\r\\nof blood, as in the hearts of men and animals, but of glowing hot,\\r\\nmelted metals and stones.  And as our hearts keep us alive, so that\\r\\ngreat lump of heat keeps the earth alive: it is a huge power of buried\\r\\nsunlight\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is what it is.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow think: out of that cauldron, where all the bubbles would be as big\\r\\nas the Alps if it could get room for its boiling, certain bubbles have\\r\\nbubbled out and escaped\\xe2\\x80\\x94up and away, and there they stand in the cool,\\r\\ncold sky\\xe2\\x80\\x94mountains.  Think of the change, and you will no more wonder\\r\\nthat there should be something awful about the very look of a mountain:\\r\\nfrom the darkness\\xe2\\x80\\x94for where the light has nothing to shine upon, much\\r\\nthe same as darkness\\xe2\\x80\\x94from the heat, from the endless tumult of boiling\\r\\nunrest\\xe2\\x80\\x94up, with a sudden heavenward shoot, into the wind, and the\\r\\ncold, and the starshine, and a cloak of snow that lies like ermine\\r\\nabove the blue-green mail of the glaciers; and the great sun, their\\r\\ngrandfather, up there in the sky; and their little old cold aunt, the\\r\\nmoon, that comes wandering about the house at night; and everlasting\\r\\nstillness, except for the wind that turns the rocks and caverns into a\\r\\nroaring organ for the young archangels that are studying how to let out\\r\\nthe pent-up praises of their hearts, and the molten music of the\\r\\nstreams, rushing ever from the bosoms of the glaciers fresh born.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThink, too, of the change in their own substance\\xe2\\x80\\x94no longer molten and\\r\\nsoft, heaving and glowing, but hard and shining and cold. Think of the\\r\\ncreatures scampering over and burrowing in it, and the birds building\\r\\ntheir nests upon it, and the trees growing out of its sides, like hair\\r\\nto clothe it, and the lovely grass in the valleys, and the gracious\\r\\nflowers even at the very edge of its armour of ice, like the rich\\r\\nembroidery of the garment below, and the rivers galloping down the\\r\\nvalleys in a tumult of white and green!  And along with all these,\\r\\nthink of the terrible precipices down which the traveller may fall and\\r\\nbe lost, and the frightful gulfs of blue air cracked in the glaciers,\\r\\nand the dark profound lakes, covered like little arctic oceans with\\r\\nfloating lumps of ice.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAll this outside the mountain!  But the inside, who shall tell what\\r\\nlies there?  Caverns of awfullest solitude, their walls miles thick,\\r\\nsparkling with ores of gold or silver, copper or iron, tin or mercury,\\r\\nstudded perhaps with precious stones\\xe2\\x80\\x94perhaps a brook, with eyeless\\r\\nfish in it, running, running ceaselessly, cold and babbling, through\\r\\nbanks crusted with carbuncles and golden topazes, or over a gravel of\\r\\nwhich some of the stones arc rubies and emeralds, perhaps diamonds and\\r\\nsapphires\\xe2\\x80\\x94who can tell?\\xe2\\x80\\x94and whoever can\\'t tell is free to think\\xe2\\x80\\x94all\\r\\nwaiting to flash, waiting for millions of ages\\xe2\\x80\\x94ever since the earth\\r\\nflew off from the sun, a great blot of fire, and began to cool.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen there are caverns full of water, numbingly cold, fiercely\\r\\nhot\\xe2\\x80\\x94hotter than any boiling water.  From some of these the water\\r\\ncannot get out, and from others it runs in channels as the blood in the\\r\\nbody: little veins bring it down from the ice above into the great\\r\\ncaverns of the mountain\\'s heart, whence the arteries let it out again,\\r\\ngushing in pipes and clefts and ducts of all shapes and kinds, through\\r\\nand through its bulk, until it springs newborn to the light, and rushes\\r\\ndown the Mountainside in torrents, and down the valleys in\\r\\nrivers\\xe2\\x80\\x94down, down, rejoicing, to the mighty lungs of the world, that\\r\\nis the sea, where it is tossed in storms and cyclones, heaved up in\\r\\nbillows, twisted in waterspouts, dashed to mist upon rocks, beaten by\\r\\nmillions of tails, and breathed by millions of gills, whence at last,\\r\\nmelted into vapour by the sun, it is lifted up pure into the air, and\\r\\nborne by the servant winds back to the mountaintops and the snow, the\\r\\nsolid ice, and the molten stream.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWell, when the heart of the earth has thus come rushing up among her\\r\\nchildren, bringing with it gifts of all that she possesses, then\\r\\nstraightway into it rush her children to see what they can find there.\\r\\nWith pickaxe and spade and crowbar, with boring chisel and blasting\\r\\npowder, they force their way back: is it to search for what toys they\\r\\nmay have left in their long-forgotten nurseries? Hence the mountains\\r\\nthat lift their heads into the clear air, and are dotted over with the\\r\\ndwellings of men, are tunnelled and bored in the darkness of their\\r\\nbosoms by the dwellers in the houses which they hold up to the sun and\\r\\nair.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie and his father were of these: their business was to bring to\\r\\nlight hidden things; they sought silver in the rock and found it, and\\r\\ncarried it out.  Of the many other precious things in their mountain\\r\\nthey knew little or nothing.  Silver ore was what they were sent to\\r\\nfind, and in darkness and danger they found it.  But oh, how sweet was\\r\\nthe air on the mountain face when they came out at sunset to go home to\\r\\nwife and mother!  They did breathe deep then!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe mines belonged to the king of the country, and the miners were his\\r\\nservants, working under his overseers and officers.  He was a real\\r\\nking\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is, one who ruled for the good of his people and not to\\r\\nplease himself, and he wanted the silver not to buy rich things for\\r\\nhimself, but to help him to govern the country, and pay the ones that\\r\\ndefended it from certain troublesome neighbours, and the judges whom he\\r\\nset to portion out righteousness among the people, that so they might\\r\\nlearn it themselves, and come to do without judges at all.  Nothing\\r\\nthat could be got from the heart of the earth could have been put to\\r\\nbetter purposes than the silver the king\\'s miners got for him.  There\\r\\nwere people in the country who, when it came into their hands, degraded\\r\\nit by locking it up in a chest, and then it grew diseased and was\\r\\ncalled mammon, and bred all sorts of quarrels; but when first it left\\r\\nthe king\\'s hands it never made any but friends, and the air of the\\r\\nworld kept it clean.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAbout a year before this story began, a series of very remarkable\\r\\nevents had just ended.  I will narrate as much of them as will serve to\\r\\nshow the tops of the roots of my tree.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nUpon the mountain, on one of its many claws, stood a grand old house,\\r\\nhalf farmhouse, half castle, belonging to the king; and there his only\\r\\nchild, the Princess Irene, had been brought up till she was nearly nine\\r\\nyears old, and would doubtless have continued much longer, but for the\\r\\nstrange events to which I have referred.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt that time the hollow places of the mountain were inhabited by\\r\\ncreatures called goblins, who for various reasons and in various ways\\r\\nmade themselves troublesome to all, but to the little princess\\r\\ndangerous.  Mainly by the watchful devotion and energy of Curdie,\\r\\nhowever, their designs had been utterly defeated, and made to recoil\\r\\nupon themselves to their own destruction, so that now there were very\\r\\nfew of them left alive, and the miners did not believe there was a\\r\\nsingle goblin remaining in the whole inside of the mountain.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe king had been so pleased with the boy\\xe2\\x80\\x94then approaching thirteen\\r\\nyears of age\\xe2\\x80\\x94that when he carried away his daughter he asked him to\\r\\naccompany them; but he was still better pleased with him when he found\\r\\nthat he preferred staying with his father and mother.  He was a right\\r\\ngood king and knew that the love of a boy who would not leave his\\r\\nfather and mother to be made a great man was worth ten thousand offers\\r\\nto die for his sake, and would prove so when the right time came.  As\\r\\nfor his father and mother, they would have given him up without a\\r\\ngrumble, for they were just as good as the king, and he and they\\r\\nunderstood each other perfectly; but in this matter, not seeing that he\\r\\ncould do anything for the king which one of his numerous attendants\\r\\ncould not do as well, Curdie felt that it was for him to decide.  So\\r\\nthe king took a kind farewell of them all and rode away, with his\\r\\ndaughter on his horse before him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA gloom fell upon the mountain and the miners when she was gone, and\\r\\nCurdie did not whistle for a whole week.  As for his verses, there was\\r\\nno occasion to make any now.  He had made them only to drive away the\\r\\ngoblins, and they were all gone\\xe2\\x80\\x94a good riddance\\xe2\\x80\\x94only the princess was\\r\\ngone too!  He would rather have had things as they were, except for the\\r\\nprincess\\'s sake.  But whoever is diligent will soon be cheerful, and\\r\\nthough the miners missed the household of the castle, they yet managed\\r\\nto get on without them. Peter and his wife, however, were troubled with\\r\\nthe fancy that they had stood in the way of their boy\\'s good fortune.\\r\\nIt would have been such a fine thing for him and them, too, they\\r\\nthought, if he had ridden with the good king\\'s train.  How beautiful he\\r\\nlooked, they said, when he rode the king\\'s own horse through the river\\r\\nthat the goblins had sent out of the hill!  He might soon have been a\\r\\ncaptain, they did believe!  The good, kind people did not reflect that\\r\\nthe road to the next duty is the only straight one, or that, for their\\r\\nfancied good, we should never wish our children or friends to do what\\r\\nwe would not do ourselves if we were in their position.  We must accept\\r\\nrighteous sacrifices as well as make them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap02\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 2\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nThe White Pigeon\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen in the winter they had had their supper and sat about the fire, or\\r\\nwhen in the summer they lay on the border of the rock-margined stream\\r\\nthat ran through their little meadow close by the door of their\\r\\ncottage, issuing from the far-up whiteness often folded in clouds,\\r\\nCurdie\\'s mother would not seldom lead the conversation to one peculiar\\r\\npersonage said and believed to have been much concerned in the late\\r\\nissue of events.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThat personage was the great-great-grandmother of the princess, of whom\\r\\nthe princess had often talked, but whom neither Curdie nor his mother\\r\\nhad ever seen.  Curdie could indeed remember, although already it\\r\\nlooked more like a dream than he could account for if it had really\\r\\ntaken place, how the princess had once led him up many stairs to what\\r\\nshe called a beautiful room in the top of the tower, where she went\\r\\nthrough all the\\xe2\\x80\\x94what should he call it?\\xe2\\x80\\x94the behaviour of presenting\\r\\nhim to her grandmother, talking now to her and now to him, while all\\r\\nthe time he saw nothing but a bare garret, a heap of musty straw, a\\r\\nsunbeam, and a withered apple. Lady, he would have declared before the\\r\\nking himself, young or old, there was none, except the princess\\r\\nherself, who was certainly vexed that he could not see what she at\\r\\nleast believed she saw.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs for his mother, she had once seen, long before Curdie was born, a\\r\\ncertain mysterious light of the same description as one Irene spoke of,\\r\\ncalling it her grandmother\\'s moon; and Curdie himself had seen this\\r\\nsame light, shining from above the castle, just as the king and\\r\\nprincess were taking their leave.  Since that time neither had seen or\\r\\nheard anything that could be supposed connected with her.  Strangely\\r\\nenough, however, nobody had seen her go away.  If she was such an old\\r\\nlady, she could hardly be supposed to have set out alone and on foot\\r\\nwhen all the house was asleep.  Still, away she must have gone, for, of\\r\\ncourse, if she was so powerful, she would always be about the princess\\r\\nto take care of her.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut as Curdie grew older, he doubted more and more whether Irene had\\r\\nnot been talking of some dream she had taken for reality: he had heard\\r\\nit said that children could not always distinguish betwixt dreams and\\r\\nactual events.  At the same time there was his mother\\'s testimony: what\\r\\nwas he to do with that?  His mother, through whom he had learned\\r\\neverything, could hardly be imagined by her own dutiful son to have\\r\\nmistaken a dream for a fact of the waking world.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo he rather shrank from thinking about it, and the less he thought\\r\\nabout it, the less he was inclined to believe it when he did think\\r\\nabout it, and therefore, of course, the less inclined to talk about it\\r\\nto his father and mother; for although his father was one of those men\\r\\nwho for one word they say think twenty thoughts, Curdie was well\\r\\nassured that he would rather doubt his own eyes than his wife\\'s\\r\\ntestimony.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere were no others to whom he could have talked about it.  The miners\\r\\nwere a mingled company\\xe2\\x80\\x94some good, some not so good, some rather\\r\\nbad\\xe2\\x80\\x94none of them so bad or so good as they might have been; Curdie\\r\\nliked most of them, and was a favourite with all; but they knew very\\r\\nlittle about the upper world, and what might or might not take place\\r\\nthere.  They knew silver from copper ore; they understood the\\r\\nunderground ways of things, and they could look very wise with their\\r\\nlanterns in their hands searching after this or that sign of ore, or\\r\\nfor some mark to guide their way in the hollows of the earth; but as to\\r\\ngreat-great-grandmothers, they would have mocked Curdie all the rest of\\r\\nhis life for the absurdity of not being absolutely certain that the\\r\\nsolemn belief of his father and mother was nothing but ridiculous\\r\\nnonsense.  Why, to them the very word \\'great-great-grandmother\\' would\\r\\nhave been a week\\'s laughter!  I am not sure that they were able quite\\r\\nto believe there were such persons as great-great-grandmothers; they\\r\\nhad never seen one.  They were not companions to give the best of help\\r\\ntoward progress, and as Curdie grew, he grew at this time faster in\\r\\nbody than in mind\\xe2\\x80\\x94with the usual consequence, that he was getting\\r\\nrather stupid\\xe2\\x80\\x94one of the chief signs of which was that he believed\\r\\nless and less in things he had never seen.  At the same time I do not\\r\\nthink he was ever so stupid as to imagine that this was a sign of\\r\\nsuperior faculty and strength of mind.  Still, he was becoming more and\\r\\nmore a miner, and less and less a man of the upper world where the wind\\r\\nblew.  On his way to and from the mine he took less and less notice of\\r\\nbees and butterflies, moths and dragonflies, the flowers and the brooks\\r\\nand the clouds.  He was gradually changing into a commonplace man.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere is this difference between the growth of some human beings and\\r\\nthat of others: in the one case it is a continuous dying, in the other\\r\\na continuous resurrection.  One of the latter sort comes at length to\\r\\nknow at once whether a thing is true the moment it comes before him;\\r\\none of the former class grows more and more afraid of being taken in,\\r\\nso afraid of it that he takes himself in altogether, and comes at\\r\\nlength to believe in nothing but his dinner: to be sure of a thing with\\r\\nhim is to have it between his teeth.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie was not in a very good way, then, at that time.  His father and\\r\\nmother had, it is true, no fault to find with him and yet\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\r\\nyet\\xe2\\x80\\x94neither of them was ready to sing when the thought of him came up.\\r\\nThere must be something wrong when a mother catches herself sighing\\r\\nover the time when her boy was in petticoats, or a father looks sad\\r\\nwhen he thinks how he used to carry him on his shoulder.  The boy\\r\\nshould enclose and keep, as his life, the old child at the heart of\\r\\nhim, and never let it go.  He must still, to be a right man, be his\\r\\nmother\\'s darling, and more, his father\\'s pride, and more.  The child is\\r\\nnot meant to die, but to be forever fresh born.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie had made himself a bow and some arrows, and was teaching himself\\r\\nto shoot with them.  One evening in the early summer, as he was walking\\r\\nhome from the mine with them in his hand, a light flashed across his\\r\\neyes.  He looked, and there was a snow-white pigeon settling on a rock\\r\\nin front of him, in the red light of the level sun.  There it fell at\\r\\nonce to work with one of its wings, in which a feather or two had got\\r\\nsome sprays twisted, causing a certain roughness unpleasant to the\\r\\nfastidious creature of the air.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was indeed a lovely being, and Curdie thought how happy it must be\\r\\nflitting through the air with a flash\\xe2\\x80\\x94a live bolt of light. For a\\r\\nmoment he became so one with the bird that he seemed to feel both its\\r\\nbill and its feathers, as the one adjusted the other to fly again, and\\r\\nhis heart swelled with the pleasure of its involuntary sympathy.\\r\\nAnother moment and it would have been aloft in the waves of rosy\\r\\nlight\\xe2\\x80\\x94it was just bending its little legs to spring: that moment it\\r\\nfell on the path broken-winged and bleeding from Curdie\\'s cruel arrow.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWith a gush of pride at his skill, and pleasure at his success, he ran\\r\\nto pick up his prey.  I must say for him he picked it up\\r\\ngently\\xe2\\x80\\x94perhaps it was the beginning of his repentance.  But when he\\r\\nhad the white thing in his hands its whiteness stained with another red\\r\\nthan that of the sunset flood in which it had been revelling\\xe2\\x80\\x94ah God!\\r\\nwho knows the joy of a bird, the ecstasy of a creature that has neither\\r\\nstorehouse nor barn!\\xe2\\x80\\x94when he held it, I say, in his victorious hands,\\r\\nthe winged thing looked up in his face\\xe2\\x80\\x94and with such eyes!\\xe2\\x80\\x94asking\\r\\nwhat was the matter, and where the red sun had gone, and the clouds,\\r\\nand the wind of its flight.  Then they closed, but to open again\\r\\npresently, with the same questions in them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd as they closed and opened, their look was fixed on his.  It did not\\r\\nonce flutter or try to get away; it only throbbed and bled and looked\\r\\nat him.  Curdie\\'s heart began to grow very large in his bosom.  What\\r\\ncould it mean?  It was nothing but a pigeon, and why should he not kill\\r\\na pigeon?  But the fact was that not till this very moment had he ever\\r\\nknown what a pigeon was.  A good many discoveries of a similar kind\\r\\nhave to be made by most of us.  Once more it opened its eyes\\xe2\\x80\\x94then\\r\\nclosed them again, and its throbbing ceased.  Curdie gave a sob: its\\r\\nlast look reminded him of the princess\\xe2\\x80\\x94he did not know why.  He\\r\\nremembered how hard he had laboured to set her beyond danger, and yet\\r\\nwhat dangers she had had to encounter for his sake: they had been\\r\\nsaviours to each other\\xe2\\x80\\x94and what had he done now?  He had stopped\\r\\nsaving, and had begun killing!  What had he been sent into the world\\r\\nfor?  Surely not to be a death to its joy and loveliness.  He had done\\r\\nthe thing that was contrary to gladness; he was a destroyer!  He was\\r\\nnot the Curdie he had been meant to be!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen the underground waters gushed from the boy\\'s heart.  And with the\\r\\ntears came the remembrance that a white pigeon, just before the\\r\\nprincess went away with her father, came from somewhere\\xe2\\x80\\x94yes, from the\\r\\ngrandmother\\'s lamp, and flew round the king and Irene and himself, and\\r\\nthen flew away: this might be that very pigeon! Horrible to think!  And\\r\\nif it wasn\\'t, yet it was a white pigeon, the same as this.  And if she\\r\\nkept a great Many pigeons\\xe2\\x80\\x94and white ones, as Irene had told him, then\\r\\nwhose pigeon could he have killed but the grand old princess\\'s?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSuddenly everything round about him seemed against him.  The red sunset\\r\\nstung him; the rocks frowned at him; the sweet wind that had been\\r\\nlaving his face as he walked up the hill dropped\\xe2\\x80\\x94as if he wasn\\'t fit\\r\\nto be kissed any more.  Was the whole world going to cast him out?\\r\\nWould he have to stand there forever, not knowing what to do, with the\\r\\ndead pigeon in his hand?  Things looked bad indeed.  Was the whole\\r\\nworld going to make a work about a pigeon\\xe2\\x80\\x94a white pigeon?  The sun\\r\\nwent down.  Great clouds gathered over the west, and shortened the\\r\\ntwilight.  The wind gave a howl, and then lay down again.  The clouds\\r\\ngathered thicker.  Then came a rumbling.  He thought it was thunder.\\r\\nIt was a rock that fell inside the mountain.  A goat ran past him down\\r\\nthe hill, followed by a dog sent to fetch him home.  He thought they\\r\\nwere goblin creatures, and trembled.  He used to despise them.  And\\r\\nstill he held the dead pigeon tenderly in his hand.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt grew darker and darker.  An evil something began to move in his\\r\\nheart.  \\'What a fool I am!\\' he said to himself.  Then he grew angry,\\r\\nand was just going to throw the bird from him and whistle, when a\\r\\nbrightness shone all round him.  He lifted his eyes, and saw a great\\r\\nglobe of light\\xe2\\x80\\x94like silver at the hottest heat: he had once seen\\r\\nsilver run from the furnace.  It shone from somewhere above the roofs\\r\\nof the castle: it must be the great old princess\\'s moon!  How could she\\r\\nbe there?  Of course she was not there!  He had asked the whole\\r\\nhousehold, and nobody knew anything about her or her globe either.  It\\r\\ncouldn\\'t be!  And yet what did that signify, when there was the white\\r\\nglobe shining, and here was the dead white bird in his hand?  That\\r\\nmoment the pigeon gave a little flutter.  \\'It\\'s not dead!\\' cried\\r\\nCurdie, almost with a shriek.  The same instant he was running full\\r\\nspeed toward the castle, never letting his heels down, lest he should\\r\\nshake the poor, wounded bird.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap03\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 3\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nThe Mistress of the Silver Moon\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen Curdie reached the castle, and ran into the little garden in front\\r\\nof it, there stood the door wide open.  This was as he had hoped, for\\r\\nwhat could he have said if he had had to knock at it? Those whose\\r\\nbusiness it is to open doors, so often mistake and shut them!  But the\\r\\nwoman now in charge often puzzled herself greatly to account for the\\r\\nstrange fact that however often she shut the door, which, like the\\r\\nrest, she took a great deal of unnecessary trouble to do, she was\\r\\ncertain, the next time she went to it, to find it open.  I speak now of\\r\\nthe great front door, of course: the back door she as persistently kept\\r\\nwide: if people could only go in by that, she said, she would then know\\r\\nwhat sort they were, and what they wanted.  But she would neither have\\r\\nknown what sort Curdie was, nor what he wanted, and would assuredly\\r\\nhave denied him admittance, for she knew nothing of who was in the\\r\\ntower.  So the front door was left open for him, and in he walked.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut where to go next he could not tell.  It was not quite dark: a dull,\\r\\nshineless twilight filled the place.  All he knew was that he must go\\r\\nup, and that proved enough for the present, for there he saw the great\\r\\nstaircase rising before him.  When he reached the top of it, he knew\\r\\nthere must be more stairs yet, for he could not be near the top of the\\r\\ntower.  Indeed by the situation of the stairs, he must be a good way\\r\\nfrom the tower itself.  But those who work well in the depths more\\r\\neasily understand the heights, for indeed in their true nature they are\\r\\none and the same; miners are in mountains; and Curdie, from knowing the\\r\\nways of the king\\'s mines, and being able to calculate his whereabouts\\r\\nin them, was now able to find his way about the king\\'s house.  He knew\\r\\nits outside perfectly, and now his business was to get his notion of\\r\\nthe inside right with the outside.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo he shut his eyes and made a picture of the outside of it in his\\r\\nmind.  Then he came in at the door of the picture, and yet kept the\\r\\npicture before him all the time\\xe2\\x80\\x94for you can do that kind of thing in\\r\\nyour mind\\xe2\\x80\\x94and took every turn of the stair over again, always watching\\r\\nto remember, every time he turned his face, how the tower lay, and then\\r\\nwhen he came to himself at the top where he stood, he knew exactly\\r\\nwhere it was, and walked at once in the right direction.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOn his way, however, he came to another stair, and up that he went, of\\r\\ncourse, watching still at every turn how the tower must lie.  At the\\r\\ntop of this stair was yet another\\xe2\\x80\\x94they were the stairs up which the\\r\\nprincess ran when first, without knowing it, she was on her way to find\\r\\nher great-great-grandmother.  At the top of the second stair he could\\r\\ngo no farther, and must therefore set out again to find the tower,\\r\\nwhich, as it rose far above the rest of the house, must have the last\\r\\nof its stairs inside itself.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHaving watched every turn to the very last, he still knew quite well in\\r\\nwhat direction he must go to find it, so he left the stair and went\\r\\ndown a passage that led, if not exactly toward it, yet nearer it.  This\\r\\npassage was rather dark, for it was very long, with only one window at\\r\\nthe end, and although there were doors on both sides of it, they were\\r\\nall shut.  At the distant window glimmered the chill east, with a few\\r\\nfeeble stars in it, and its like was dreary and old, growing brown, and\\r\\nlooking as if it were thinking about the day that was just gone.\\r\\nPresently he turned into another passage, which also had a window at\\r\\nthe end of it; and in at that window shone all that was left of the\\r\\nsunset, just a few ashes, with here and there a little touch of warmth:\\r\\nit was nearly as sad as the east, only there was one difference\\xe2\\x80\\x94it was\\r\\nvery plainly thinking of tomorrow.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut at present Curdie had nothing to do with today or tomorrow; his\\r\\nbusiness was with the bird, and the tower where dwelt the grand old\\r\\nprincess to whom it belonged.  So he kept on his way, still eastward,\\r\\nand came to yet another passage, which brought him to a door.  He was\\r\\nafraid to open it without first knocking.  He knocked, but heard no\\r\\nanswer.  He was answered nevertheless; for the door gently opened, and\\r\\nthere was a narrow stair\\xe2\\x80\\x94and so steep that, big lad as he was, he,\\r\\ntoo, like the Princess Irene before him, found his hands needful for\\r\\nthe climbing.  And it was a long climb, but he reached the top at\\r\\nlast\\xe2\\x80\\x94a little landing, with a door in front and one on each side.\\r\\nWhich should he knock at?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs he hesitated, he heard the noise of a spinning wheel.  He knew it at\\r\\nonce, because his mother\\'s spinning wheel had been his governess long\\r\\nago, and still taught him things.  It was the spinning wheel that first\\r\\ntaught him to make verses, and to sing, and to think whether all was\\r\\nright inside him; or at least it had helped him in all these things.\\r\\nHence it was no wonder he should know a spinning wheel when he heard it\\r\\nsing\\xe2\\x80\\x94even although as the bird of paradise to other birds was the song\\r\\nof that wheel to the song of his mother\\'s.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe stood listening, so entranced that he forgot to knock, and the wheel\\r\\nwent on and on, spinning in his brain songs and tales and rhymes, till\\r\\nhe was almost asleep as well as dreaming, for sleep does not always\\r\\ncome first.  But suddenly came the thought of the poor bird, which had\\r\\nbeen lying motionless in his hand all the time, and that woke him up,\\r\\nand at once he knocked.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Come in, Curdie,\\' said a voice.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie shook.  It was getting rather awful.  The heart that had never\\r\\nmuch heeded an army of goblins trembled at the soft word of invitation.\\r\\nBut then there was the red-spotted white thing in his hand!  He dared\\r\\nnot hesitate, though.  Gently he opened the door through which the\\r\\nsound came, and what did he see?  Nothing at first\\xe2\\x80\\x94except indeed a\\r\\ngreat sloping shaft of moonlight that came in at a high window, and\\r\\nrested on the floor.  He stood and stared at it, forgetting to shut the\\r\\ndoor.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Why don\\'t you come in, Curdie?\\' said the voice.  \\'Did you never see\\r\\nmoonlight before?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Never without a moon,\\' answered Curdie, in a trembling tone, but\\r\\ngathering courage.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Certainly not,\\' returned the voice, which was thin and quavering: \\'I\\r\\nnever saw moonlight without a moon.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'But there\\'s no moon outside,\\' said Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Ah! but you\\'re inside now,\\' said the voice.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe answer did not satisfy Curdie; but the voice went on.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'There are more moons than you know of, Curdie.  Where there is one sun\\r\\nthere are many moons\\xe2\\x80\\x94and of many sorts.  Come in and look out of my\\r\\nwindow, and you will soon satisfy yourself that there is a moon looking\\r\\nin at it.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe gentleness of the voice made Curdie remember his manners.  He shut\\r\\nthe door, and drew a step or two nearer to the moonlight.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAll the time the sound of the spinning had been going on and on, and\\r\\nCurdie now caught sight of the wheel.  Oh, it was such a thin, delicate\\r\\nthing\\xe2\\x80\\x94reminding him of a spider\\'s web in a hedge.  It stood in the\\r\\nmiddle of the moonlight, and it seemed as if the moonlight had nearly\\r\\nmelted it away.  A step nearer, he saw, with a start, two little hands\\r\\nat work with it.  And then at last, in the shadow on the other side of\\r\\nthe moonlight which came like silver between, he saw the form to which\\r\\nthe hands belonged: a small withered creature, so old that no age would\\r\\nhave seemed too great to write under her picture, seated on a stool\\r\\nbeyond the spinning wheel, which looked very large beside her, but, as\\r\\nI said, very thin, like a long-legged spider holding up its own web,\\r\\nwhich was the round wheel itself She sat crumpled together, a filmy\\r\\nthing that it seemed a puff would blow away, more like the body of a\\r\\nfly the big spider had sucked empty and left hanging in his web, than\\r\\nanything else I can think of.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen Curdie saw her, he stood still again, a good deal in wonder, a\\r\\nvery little in reverence, a little in doubt, and, I must add, a little\\r\\nin amusement at the odd look of the old marvel.  Her grey hair mixed\\r\\nwith the moonlight so that he could not tell where the one began and\\r\\nthe other ended.  Her crooked back bent forward over her chest, her\\r\\nshoulders nearly swallowed up her head between them, and her two little\\r\\nhands were just like the grey claws of a hen, scratching at the thread,\\r\\nwhich to Curdie was of course invisible across the moonlight.  Indeed\\r\\nCurdie laughed within himself, just a little, at the sight; and when he\\r\\nthought of how the princess used to talk about her huge, great, old\\r\\ngrandmother, he laughed more.  But that moment the little lady leaned\\r\\nforward into the moonlight, and Curdie caught a glimpse of her eyes,\\r\\nand all the laugh went out of him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'What do you come here for, Curdie?\\' she said, as gently as before.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen Curdie remembered that he stood there as a culprit, and worst of\\r\\nall, as one who had his confession yet to make.  There was no time to\\r\\nhesitate over it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Oh, ma\\'am!  See here,\\' he said, and advanced a step or two, holding\\r\\nout the pigeon.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'What have you got there?\\' she asked.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAgain Curdie advanced a few steps, and held out his hand with the\\r\\npigeon, that she might see what it was, into the moonlight.  The moment\\r\\nthe rays fell upon it the pigeon gave a faint flutter.  The old lady\\r\\nput out her old hands and took it, and held it to her bosom, and rocked\\r\\nit, murmuring over it as if it were a sick baby.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen Curdie saw how distressed she was he grew sorrier still, and said:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I didn\\'t mean to do any harm, ma\\'am.  I didn\\'t think of its being\\r\\nyours.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Ah, Curdie!  If it weren\\'t mine, what would become of it now?\\' she\\r\\nreturned.  \\'You say you didn\\'t mean any harm: did you mean any good,\\r\\nCurdie?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'No,\\' answered Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Remember, then, that whoever does not mean good is always in danger of\\r\\nharm.  But I try to give everybody fair play; and those that are in the\\r\\nwrong are in far more need of it always than those who are in the\\r\\nright: they can afford to do without it.  Therefore I say for you that\\r\\nwhen you shot that arrow you did not know what a pigeon is.  Now that\\r\\nyou do know, you are sorry.  It is very dangerous to do things you\\r\\ndon\\'t know about.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'But, please, ma\\'am\\xe2\\x80\\x94I don\\'t mean to be rude or to contradict you,\\'\\r\\nsaid Curdie, \\'but if a body was never to do anything but what he knew\\r\\nto be good, he would have to live half his time doing nothing.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'There you are much mistaken,\\' said the old quavering voice.  \\'How\\r\\nlittle you must have thought!  Why, you don\\'t seem even to know the\\r\\ngood of the things you are constantly doing.  Now don\\'t mistake me. I\\r\\ndon\\'t mean you are good for doing them.  It is a good thing to eat your\\r\\nbreakfast, but you don\\'t fancy it\\'s very good of you to do it.  The\\r\\nthing is good, not you.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie laughed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'There are a great many more good things than bad things to do. Now\\r\\ntell me what bad thing you have done today besides this sore hurt to my\\r\\nlittle white friend.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhile she talked Curdie had sunk into a sort of reverie, in which he\\r\\nhardly knew whether it was the old lady or his own heart that spoke.\\r\\nAnd when she asked him that question, he was at first much inclined to\\r\\nconsider himself a very good fellow on the whole.  \\'I really don\\'t\\r\\nthink I did anything else that was very bad all day,\\' he said to\\r\\nhimself.  But at the same time he could not honestly feel that he was\\r\\nworth standing up for.  All at once a light seemed to break in upon his\\r\\nmind, and he woke up and there was the withered little atomy of the old\\r\\nlady on the other side of the moonlight, and there was the spinning\\r\\nwheel singing on and on in the middle of it!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I know now, ma\\'am; I understand now,\\' he said.  \\'Thank you, ma\\'am, for\\r\\nspinning it into me with your wheel.  I see now that I have been doing\\r\\nwrong the whole day, and such a many days besides! Indeed, I don\\'t know\\r\\nwhen I ever did right, and yet it seems as if I had done right some\\r\\ntime and had forgotten how.  When I killed your bird I did not know I\\r\\nwas doing wrong, just because I was always doing wrong, and the wrong\\r\\nhad soaked all through me.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'What wrong were you doing all day, Curdie?  It is better to come to\\r\\nthe point, you know,\\' said the old lady, and her voice was gentler even\\r\\nthan before.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I was doing the wrong of never wanting or trying to be better. And now\\r\\nI see that I have been letting things go as they would for a long time.\\r\\nWhatever came into my head I did, and whatever didn\\'t come into my head\\r\\nI didn\\'t do.  I never sent anything away, and never looked out for\\r\\nanything to come.  I haven\\'t been attending to my mother\\xe2\\x80\\x94or my father\\r\\neither.  And now I think of it, I know I have often seen them looking\\r\\ntroubled, and I have never asked them what was the matter.  And now I\\r\\nsee, too, that I did not ask because I suspected it had something to do\\r\\nwith me and my behaviour, and didn\\'t want to hear the truth.  And I\\r\\nknow I have been grumbling at my work, and doing a hundred other things\\r\\nthat are wrong.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'You have got it, Curdie,\\' said the old lady, in a voice that sounded\\r\\nalmost as if she had been crying.  \\'When people don\\'t care to be better\\r\\nthey must be doing everything wrong.  I am so glad you shot my bird!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Ma\\'am!\\' exclaimed Curdie.  \\'How can you be?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Because it has brought you to see what sort you were when you did it,\\r\\nand what sort you will grow to be again, only worse, if you don\\'t mind.\\r\\nNow that you are sorry, my poor bird will be better. Look up, my dovey.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe pigeon gave a flutter, and spread out one of its red-spotted wings\\r\\nacross the old woman\\'s bosom.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I will mend the little angel,\\' she said, \\'and in a week or two it will\\r\\nbe flying again.  So you may ease your heart about the pigeon.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Oh, thank you!  Thank you!\\' cried Curdie.  \\'I don\\'t know how to thank\\r\\nyou.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Then I will tell you.  There is only one way I care for.  Do better,\\r\\nand grow better, and be better.  And never kill anything without a good\\r\\nreason for it.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Ma\\'am, I will go and fetch my bow and arrows, and you shall burn them\\r\\nyourself.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I have no fire that would burn your bow and arrows, Curdie.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Then I promise you to burn them all under my mother\\'s porridge pot\\r\\ntomorrow morning.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'No, no, Curdie.  Keep them, and practice with them every day, and grow\\r\\na good shot.  There are plenty of bad things that want killing, and a\\r\\nday will come when they will prove useful.  But I must see first\\r\\nwhether you will do as I tell you.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'That I will!\\' said Curdie.  \\'What is it, ma\\'am?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Only something not to do,\\' answered the old lady; \\'if you should hear\\r\\nanyone speak about me, never to laugh or make fun of me.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Oh, ma\\'am!\\' exclaimed Curdie, shocked that she should think such a\\r\\nrequest needful.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Stop, stop,\\' she went on.  \\'People hereabout sometimes tell very odd\\r\\nand in fact ridiculous stories of an old woman who watches what is\\r\\ngoing on, and occasionally interferes.  They mean me, though what they\\r\\nsay is often great nonsense.  Now what I want of you is not to laugh,\\r\\nor side with them in any way; because they will take that to mean that\\r\\nyou don\\'t believe there is any such person a bit more than they do.\\r\\nNow that would not be the case\\xe2\\x80\\x94would it, Curdie?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'No, indeed, ma\\'am.  I\\'ve seen you.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe old woman smiled very oddly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Yes, you\\'ve seen me,\\' she said.  \\'But mind,\\' she continued, \\'I don\\'t\\r\\nwant you to say anything\\xe2\\x80\\x94only to hold your tongue, and not seem to\\r\\nside with them.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'That will be easy,\\'said Curdie,\\'now that I\\'ve seen you with my very\\r\\nown eyes, ma\\'am.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Not so easy as you think, perhaps,\\' said the old lady, with another\\r\\ncurious smile.  \\'I want to be your friend,\\' she added after a little\\r\\npause, \\'but I don\\'t quite know yet whether you will let me.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Indeed I will, ma\\'am,\\' said Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'That is for me to find out,\\' she rejoined, with yet another strange\\r\\nsmile.  \\'In the meantime all I can say is, come to me again when you\\r\\nfind yourself in any trouble, and I will see what I can do for\\r\\nyou\\xe2\\x80\\x94only the canning depends on yourself.  I am greatly pleased with\\r\\nyou for bringing me my pigeon, doing your best to set right what you\\r\\nhad set wrong.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs she spoke she held out her hand to him, and when he took it she made\\r\\nuse of his to help herself up from her stool, and\\xe2\\x80\\x94when or how it came\\r\\nabout, Curdie could not tell\\xe2\\x80\\x94the same instant she stood before him a\\r\\ntall, strong woman\\xe2\\x80\\x94plainly very old, but as grand as she was old, and\\r\\nonly rather severe-looking.  Every trace of the decrepitude and\\r\\nwitheredness she showed as she hovered like a film about her wheel, had\\r\\nvanished.  Her hair was very white, but it hung about her head in great\\r\\nplenty, and shone like silver in the moonlight.  Straight as a pillar\\r\\nshe stood before the astonished boy, and the wounded bird had now\\r\\nspread out both its wings across her bosom, like some great mystical\\r\\nornament of frosted silver.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Oh, now I can never forget you!\\' cried Curdie.  \\'I see now what you\\r\\nreally are!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Did I not tell you the truth when I sat at my wheel?\\' said the old\\r\\nlady.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Yes, ma\\'am,\\' answered Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I can do no more than tell you the truth now,\\' she rejoined.  \\'It is a\\r\\nbad thing indeed to forget one who has told us the truth.  Now go.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie obeyed, and took a few steps toward the door.  \\'Please,\\r\\nma\\'am\\xe2\\x80\\x94what am I to call you?\\' he was going to say; but when he turned\\r\\nto speak, he saw nobody.  Whether she was there or not he could not\\r\\ntell, however, for the moonlight had vanished, and the room was utterly\\r\\ndark.  A great fear, such as he had never before known, came upon him,\\r\\nand almost overwhelmed him.  He groped his way to the door, and crawled\\r\\ndown the stair\\xe2\\x80\\x94in doubt and anxiety as to how he should find his way\\r\\nout of the house in the dark.  And the stair seemed ever so much longer\\r\\nthan when he came up.  Nor was that any wonder, for down and down he\\r\\nwent, until at length his foot struck a door, and when he rose and\\r\\nopened it, he found himself under the starry, moonless sky at the foot\\r\\nof the tower.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe soon discovered the way out of the garden, with which he had some\\r\\nacquaintance already, and in a few minutes was climbing the mountain\\r\\nwith a solemn and cheerful heart.  It was rather dark, but he knew the\\r\\nway well.  As he passed the rock from which the poor pigeon fell\\r\\nwounded with his arrow, a great joy filled his heart at the thought\\r\\nthat he was delivered from the blood of the little bird, and he ran the\\r\\nnext hundred yards at full speed up the hill. Some dark shadows passed\\r\\nhim: he did not even care to think what they were, but let them run.\\r\\nWhen he reached home, he found his father and mother waiting supper for\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap04\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 4\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCurdie\\'s Father and Mother\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe eyes of the fathers and mothers are quick to read their children\\'s\\r\\nlooks, and when Curdie entered the cottage, his parents saw at once\\r\\nthat something unusual had taken place.  When he said to his mother, \\'I\\r\\nbeg your pardon for being so late,\\' there was something in the tone\\r\\nbeyond the politeness that went to her heart, for it seemed to come\\r\\nfrom the place where all lovely things were born before they began to\\r\\ngrow in this world.  When he set his father\\'s chair to the table, an\\r\\nattention he had not shown him for a long time, Peter thanked him with\\r\\nmore gratitude than the boy had ever yet felt in all his life.  It was\\r\\na small thing to do for the man who had been serving him since ever he\\r\\nwas born, but I suspect there is nothing a man can be so grateful for\\r\\nas that to which he has the most right.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere was a change upon Curdie, and father and mother felt there must\\r\\nbe something to account for it, and therefore were pretty sure he had\\r\\nsomething to tell them.  For when a child\\'s heart is all right, it is\\r\\nnot likely he will want to keep anything from his parents.  But the\\r\\nstory of the evening was too solemn for Curdie to come out with all at\\r\\nonce.  He must wait until they had had their porridge, and the affairs\\r\\nof this world were over for the day.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut when they were seated on the grassy bank of the brook that went so\\r\\nsweetly blundering over the great stones of its rocky channel, for the\\r\\nwhole meadow lay on the top of a huge rock, then he felt that the right\\r\\nhour had come for sharing with them the wonderful things that had come\\r\\nto him.  It was perhaps the loveliest of all hours in the year.  The\\r\\nsummer was young and soft, and this was the warmest evening they had\\r\\nyet had\\xe2\\x80\\x94dusky, dark even below, while above, the stars were bright and\\r\\nlarge and sharp in the blackest blue sky.  The night came close around\\r\\nthem, clasping them in one universal arm of love, and although it\\r\\nneither spoke nor smiled, seemed all eye and ear, seemed to see and\\r\\nhear and know everything they said and did.  It is a way the night has\\r\\nsometimes, and there is a reason for it.  The only sound was that of\\r\\nthe brook, for there was no wind, and no trees for it to make its music\\r\\nupon if there had been, for the cottage was high up on the mountain, on\\r\\na great shoulder of stone where trees would not grow.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere, to the accompaniment of the water, as it hurried down to the\\r\\nvalley and the sea, talking busily of a thousand true things which it\\r\\ncould not understand, Curdie told his tale, outside and in, to his\\r\\nfather and mother.  What a world had slipped in between the mouth of\\r\\nthe mine and his mother\\'s cottage!  Neither of them said a word until\\r\\nhe had ended.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Now what am I to make of it, Mother? it\\'s so strange!\\' he said, and\\r\\nstopped.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'It\\'s easy enough to see what Curdie has got to make of it, isn\\'t it,\\r\\nPeter?\\' said the good woman, turning her face toward all she could see\\r\\nof her husband\\'s.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'It seems so to me,\\' answered Peter, with a smile which only the night\\r\\nsaw, but his wife felt in the tone of his words.  They were the\\r\\nhappiest couple in that country, because they always understood each\\r\\nother, and that was because they always meant the same thing, and that\\r\\nwas because they always loved what was fair and true and right better,\\r\\nnot than anything else, but than everything else put together.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Then will you tell Curdie?\\' said she.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'You can talk best, Joan,\\' said he.  \\'You tell him, and I will\\r\\nlisten\\xe2\\x80\\x94and learn how to say what I think,\\' he added.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I,\\' said Curdie, \\'don\\'t know what to think.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'It does not matter so much,\\' said his mother.  \\'If only you know what\\r\\nto make of a thing, you\\'ll know soon enough what to think of it.  Now I\\r\\nneedn\\'t tell you, surely, Curdie, what you\\'ve got to do with this?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I suppose you mean, Mother,\\' answered Curdie, \\'that I must do as the\\r\\nold lady told me?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'That is what I mean: what else could it be?  Am I not right, Peter?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Quite right, Joan,\\' answered Peter, \\'so far as my judgement goes. It\\r\\nis a very strange story, but you see the question is not about\\r\\nbelieving it, for Curdie knows what came to him.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'And you remember, Curdie,\\' said his mother, \\'that when the princess\\r\\ntook you up that tower once before, and there talked to her\\r\\ngreat-great-grandmother, you came home quite angry with her, and said\\r\\nthere was nothing in the place but an old tub, a heap of straw\\xe2\\x80\\x94oh, I\\r\\nremember your inventory quite well!\\xe2\\x80\\x94an old tub, a heap of straw, a\\r\\nwithered apple, and a sunbeam.  According to your eyes, that was all\\r\\nthere was in the great, old, musty garret.  But now you have had a\\r\\nglimpse of the old princess herself!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Yes, Mother, I did see her\\xe2\\x80\\x94or if I didn\\'t\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\' said Curdie very\\r\\nthoughtfully\\xe2\\x80\\x94then began again.  \\'The hardest thing to believe, though\\r\\nI saw it with my own eyes, was when the thin, filmy creature that\\r\\nseemed almost to float about in the moonlight like a bit of the silver\\r\\npaper they put over pictures, or like a handkerchief made of spider\\r\\nthreads, took my hand, and rose up.  She was taller and stronger than\\r\\nyou, Mother, ever so much!\\xe2\\x80\\x94at least, she looked so.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'And most certainly was so, Curdie, if she looked so,\\' said Mrs\\r\\nPeterson.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Well, I confess,\\' returned her son, \\'that one thing, if there were no\\r\\nother, would make me doubt whether I was not dreaming, after all, wide\\r\\nawake though I fancied myself to be.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Of course,\\' answered his mother, \\'it is not for me to say whether you\\r\\nwere dreaming or not if you are doubtful of it yourself; but it doesn\\'t\\r\\nmake me think I am dreaming when in the summer I hold in my hand the\\r\\nbunch of sweet peas that make my heart glad with their colour and\\r\\nscent, and remember the dry, withered-looking little thing I dibbled\\r\\ninto the hole in the same spot in the spring.  I only think how\\r\\nwonderful and lovely it all is.  It seems just as full of reason as it\\r\\nis of wonder.  How it is done I can\\'t tell, only there it is!  And\\r\\nthere is this in it, too, Curdie\\xe2\\x80\\x94of which you would not be so ready to\\r\\nthink\\xe2\\x80\\x94that when you come home to your father and mother, and they find\\r\\nyou behaving more like a dear, good son than you have behaved for a\\r\\nlong time, they at least are not likely to think you were only\\r\\ndreaming.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Still,\\' said Curdie, looking a little ashamed, \\'I might have dreamed\\r\\nmy duty.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Then dream often, my son; for there must then be more truth in your\\r\\ndreams than in your waking thoughts.  But however any of these things\\r\\nmay be, this one point remains certain: there can be no harm in doing\\r\\nas she told you.  And, indeed, until you are sure there is no such\\r\\nperson, you are bound to do it, for you promised.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'It seems to me,\\' said his father, \\'that if a lady comes to you in a\\r\\ndream, Curdie, and tells you not to talk about her when you wake, the\\r\\nleast you can do is to hold your tongue.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'True, Father!  Yes, Mother, I\\'ll do it,\\' said Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen they went to bed, and sleep, which is the night of the soul, next\\r\\ntook them in its arms and made them well.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap05\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 5\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nThe Miners\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt much increased Curdie\\'s feeling of the strangeness of the whole\\r\\naffair, that, the next morning, when they were at work in the mine, the\\r\\nparty of which he and his father were two, just as if they had known\\r\\nwhat had happened to him the night before, began talking about all\\r\\nmanner of wonderful tales that were abroad in the country, chiefly, of\\r\\ncourse, those connected with the mines, and the mountains in which they\\r\\nlay.  Their wives and mothers and grandmothers were their chief\\r\\nauthorities.  For when they sat by their firesides they heard their\\r\\nwives telling their children the selfsame tales, with little\\r\\ndifferences, and here and there one they had not heard before, which\\r\\nthey had heard their mothers and grandmothers tell in one or other of\\r\\nthe same cottages.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt length they came to speak of a certain strange being they called Old\\r\\nMother Wotherwop.  Some said their wives had seen her.  It appeared as\\r\\nthey talked that not one had seen her more than once. Some of their\\r\\nmothers and grandmothers, however, had seen her also, and they all had\\r\\ntold them tales about her when they were children. They said she could\\r\\ntake any shape she liked, but that in reality she was a withered old\\r\\nwoman, so old and so withered that she was as thin as a sieve with a\\r\\nlamp behind it; that she was never seen except at night, and when\\r\\nsomething terrible had taken place, or was going to take place\\xe2\\x80\\x94such as\\r\\nthe falling in of the roof of a mine, or the breaking out of water in\\r\\nit.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe had more than once been seen\\xe2\\x80\\x94it was always at night\\xe2\\x80\\x94beside some\\r\\nwell, sitting on the brink of it, and leaning over and stirring it with\\r\\nher forefinger, which was six times as long as any of the rest.  And\\r\\nwhoever for months after drank of that well was sure to be ill.  To\\r\\nthis, one of them, however, added that he remembered his mother saying\\r\\nthat whoever in bad health drank of the well was sure to get better.\\r\\nBut the majority agreed that the former was the right version of the\\r\\nstory\\xe2\\x80\\x94for was she not a witch, an old hating witch, whose delight was\\r\\nto do mischief?  One said he had heard that she took the shape of a\\r\\nyoung woman sometimes, as beautiful as an angel, and then was most\\r\\ndangerous of all, for she struck every man who looked upon her\\r\\nstone-blind.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter ventured the question whether she might not as likely be an angel\\r\\nthat took the form of an old woman, as an old woman that took the form\\r\\nof an angel.  But nobody except Curdie, who was holding his peace with\\r\\nall his might, saw any sense in the question.  They said an old woman\\r\\nmight be very glad to make herself look like a young one, but who ever\\r\\nheard of a young and beautiful one making herself look old and ugly?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter asked why they were so much more ready to believe the bad that\\r\\nwas said of her than the good.  They answered, because she was bad.  He\\r\\nasked why they believed her to be bad, and they answered, because she\\r\\ndid bad things.  When he asked how they knew that, they said, because\\r\\nshe was a bad creature.  Even if they didn\\'t know it, they said, a\\r\\nwoman like that was so much more likely to be bad than good.  Why did\\r\\nshe go about at night?  Why did she appear only now and then, and on\\r\\nsuch occasions?  One went on to tell how one night when his grandfather\\r\\nhad been having a jolly time of it with his friends in the market town,\\r\\nshe had served him so upon his way home that the poor man never drank a\\r\\ndrop of anything stronger than water after it to the day of his death.\\r\\nShe dragged him into a bog, and tumbled him up and down in it till he\\r\\nwas nearly dead.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I suppose that was her way of teaching him what a good thing water\\r\\nwas,\\' said Peter; but the man, who liked strong drink, did not see the\\r\\njoke.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'They do say,\\' said another, \\'that she has lived in the old house over\\r\\nthere ever since the little princess left it.  They say too that the\\r\\nhousekeeper knows all about it, and is hand and glove with the old\\r\\nwitch.  I don\\'t doubt they have many a nice airing together on\\r\\nbroomsticks.  But I don\\'t doubt either it\\'s all nonsense, and there\\'s\\r\\nno such person at all.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'When our cow died,\\' said another, \\'she was seen going round and round\\r\\nthe cowhouse the same night.  To be sure she left a fine calf behind\\r\\nher\\xe2\\x80\\x94I mean the cow did, not the witch.  I wonder she didn\\'t kill that,\\r\\ntoo, for she\\'ll be a far finer cow than ever her mother was.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'My old woman came upon her one night, not long before the water broke\\r\\nout in the mine, sitting on a stone on the hillside with a whole\\r\\ncongregation of cobs about her.  When they saw my wife they all\\r\\nscampered off as fast as they could run, and where the witch was\\r\\nsitting there was nothing to be seen but a withered bracken bush.  I\\r\\nmade no doubt myself she was putting them up to it.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd so they went on with one foolish tale after another, while Peter\\r\\nput in a word now and then, and Curdie diligently held his peace.  But\\r\\nhis silence at last drew attention upon it, and one of them said:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Come, young Curdie, what are you thinking of?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'How do you know I\\'m thinking of anything?\\' asked Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Because you\\'re not saying anything.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Does it follow then that, as you are saying so much, you\\'re not\\r\\nthinking at all?\\' said Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I know what he\\'s thinking,\\' said one who had not yet spoken; \\'he\\'s\\r\\nthinking what a set of fools you are to talk such rubbish; as if ever\\r\\nthere was or could be such an old woman as you say!  I\\'m sure Curdie\\r\\nknows better than all that comes to.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I think,\\' said Curdie, \\'it would be better that he who says anything\\r\\nabout her should be quite sure it is true, lest she should hear him,\\r\\nand not like to be slandered.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'But would she like it any better if it were true?\\' said the same man.\\r\\n\\'If she is What they say\\xe2\\x80\\x94I don\\'t know\\xe2\\x80\\x94but I never knew a man that\\r\\nwouldn\\'t go in a rage to be called the very thing he was.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'If bad things were true of her, and I knew it,\\' said Curdie, \\'I would\\r\\nnot hesitate to say them, for I will never give in to being afraid of\\r\\nanything that\\'s bad.  I suspect that the things they tell, however, if\\r\\nwe knew all about them, would turn out to have nothing but good in\\r\\nthem; and I won\\'t say a word more for fear I should say something that\\r\\nmightn\\'t be to her mind.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey all burst into a loud laugh.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Hear the parson!\\' they cried.  \\'He believes in the witch!  Ha! ha!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'He\\'s afraid of her!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'And says all she does is good!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'He wants to make friends with her, that she may help him to find the\\r\\nsilver ore.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Give me my own eyes and a good divining rod before all the witches in\\r\\nthe world!  And so I\\'d advise you too, Master Curdie; that is, when\\r\\nyour eyes have grown to be worth anything, and you have learned to cut\\r\\nthe hazel fork.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThus they all mocked and jeered at him, but he did his best to keep his\\r\\ntemper and go quietly on with his work.  He got as close to his father\\r\\nas he could, however, for that helped him to bear it.  As soon as they\\r\\nwere tired of laughing and mocking, Curdie was friendly with them, and\\r\\nlong before their midday meal all between them was as it had been.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut when the evening came, Peter and Curdie felt that they would rather\\r\\nwalk home together without other company, and therefore lingered behind\\r\\nwhen the rest of the men left the mine.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap06\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 6\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nThe Emerald\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFather and son had seated themselves on a projecting piece of rock at a\\r\\ncorner where three galleries met\\xe2\\x80\\x94the one they had come along from\\r\\ntheir work, one to the right leading out of the mountain, and the other\\r\\nto the left leading far into a portion of it which had been long\\r\\ndisused.  Since the inundation caused by the goblins, it had indeed\\r\\nbeen rendered impassable by the settlement of a quantity of the water,\\r\\nforming a small but very deep lake, in a part where there was a\\r\\nconsiderable descent.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey had just risen and were turning to the right, when a gleam caught\\r\\ntheir eyes, and made them look along the whole gallery.  Far up they\\r\\nsaw a pale green light, whence issuing they could not tell, about\\r\\nhalfway between floor and roof of the passage.  They saw nothing but\\r\\nthe light, which was like a large star, with a point of darker colour\\r\\nyet brighter radiance in the heart of it, whence the rest of the light\\r\\nshot out in rays that faded toward the ends until they vanished.  It\\r\\nshed hardly any light around it, although in itself it was so bright as\\r\\nto sting the eyes that beheld it. Wonderful stories had from ages gone\\r\\nbeen current in the mines about certain magic gems which gave out light\\r\\nof themselves, and this light looked just like what might be supposed\\r\\nto shoot from the heart of such a gem.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey went up the old gallery to find out what it could be.  To their\\r\\nsurprise they found, however, that, after going some distance, they\\r\\nwere no nearer to it, so far as they could judge, than when they\\r\\nstarted.  It did not seem to move, and yet they moving did not approach\\r\\nit.  Still they persevered, for it was far too wonderful a thing to\\r\\nlose sight of, so long as they could keep it.  At length they drew near\\r\\nthe hollow where the water lay, and still were no nearer the light.\\r\\nWhere they expected to be stopped by the water, however, water was\\r\\nnone: something had taken place in some part of the mine that had\\r\\ndrained it off, and the gallery lay open as in former times.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd now, to their surprise, the light, instead of being in front of\\r\\nthem, was shining at the same distance to the right, where they did not\\r\\nknow there was any passage at all.  Then they discovered, by the light\\r\\nof the lanterns they carried, that there the water had broken through,\\r\\nand made an entrance to a part of the mountain of which Peter knew\\r\\nnothing.  But they were hardly well into it, still following the light,\\r\\nbefore Curdie thought he recognized some of the passages he had so\\r\\noften gone through when he was watching the goblins.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAfter they had advanced a long way, with many turnings, now to the\\r\\nright, now to the left, all at once their eyes seemed to come suddenly\\r\\nto themselves, and they became aware that the light which they had\\r\\ntaken to be a great way from them was in reality almost within reach of\\r\\ntheir hands.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe same instant it began to grow larger and thinner, the point of\\r\\nlight grew dim as it spread, the greenness melted away, and in a moment\\r\\nor two, instead of the star, a dark, dark and yet luminous face was\\r\\nlooking at them with living eyes.  And Curdie felt a great awe swell up\\r\\nin his heart, for he thought he had seen those eyes before.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I see you know me, Curdie,\\' said a voice.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'If your eyes are you, ma\\'am, then I know you,\\' said Curdie.  \\'But I\\r\\nnever saw your face before.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Yes, you have seen it, Curdie,\\' said the voice.  And with that the\\r\\ndarkness of its complexion melted away, and down from the face dawned\\r\\nout the form that belonged to it, until at last Curdie and his father\\r\\nbeheld a lady, beautiful exceedingly, dressed in something pale green,\\r\\nlike velvet, over which her hair fell in cataracts of a rich golden\\r\\ncolour.  It looked as if it were pouring down from her head, and, like\\r\\nthe water of the Dustbrook, vanishing in a golden vapour ere it reached\\r\\nthe floor.  It came flowing from under the edge of a coronet of gold,\\r\\nset with alternated pearls and emeralds.  In front of the crown was a\\r\\ngreat emerald, which looked somehow as if out of it had come the light\\r\\nthey had followed. There was no ornament else about her, except on her\\r\\nslippers, which were one mass of gleaming emeralds, of various shades\\r\\nof green, all mingling lovelily like the waving of grass in the wind\\r\\nand sun. She looked about five-and-twenty years old.  And for all the\\r\\ndifference, Curdie knew somehow or other, he could not have told how,\\r\\nthat the face before him was that of the old princess, Irene\\'s\\r\\ngreat-great-grandmother.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy this time all around them had grown light, and now first they could\\r\\nsee where they were.  They stood in a great splendid cavern, which\\r\\nCurdie recognized as that in which the goblins held their state\\r\\nassemblies.  But, strange to tell, the light by which they saw came\\r\\nstreaming, sparkling, and shooting from stones of many colours in the\\r\\nsides and roof and floor of the cavern\\xe2\\x80\\x94stones of all the colours of\\r\\nthe rainbow, and many more.  It was a glorious sight\\xe2\\x80\\x94the whole rugged\\r\\nplace flashing with colours\\xe2\\x80\\x94in one spot a great light of deep\\r\\ncarbuncular red, in another of sapphirine blue, in another of topaz\\r\\nyellow; while here and there were groups of stones of all hues and\\r\\nsizes, and again nebulous spaces of thousands of tiniest spots of\\r\\nbrilliancy of every conceivable shade.  Sometimes the colours ran\\r\\ntogether, and made a little river or lake of lambent, interfusing, and\\r\\nchanging tints, which, by their variegation, seemed to imitate the\\r\\nflowing of water, or waves made by the wind.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie would have gazed entranced, but that all the beauty of the\\r\\ncavern, yes, of all he knew of the whole creation, seemed gathered in\\r\\none centre of harmony and loveliness in the person of the ancient lady\\r\\nwho stood before him in the very summer of beauty and strength.\\r\\nTurning from the first glance at the circuadjacent splendour, it\\r\\ndwindled into nothing as he looked again at the lady. Nothing flashed\\r\\nor glowed or shone about her, and yet it was with a prevision of the\\r\\ntruth that he said,\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I was here once before, ma\\'am.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I know that, Curdie,\\' she replied.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'The place was full of torches, and the walls gleamed, but nothing as\\r\\nthey do now, and there is no light in the place.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'You want to know where the light comes from?\\' she said, smiling.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Yes, ma\\'am.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Then see: I will go out of the cavern.  Do not be afraid, but watch.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe went slowly out.  The moment she turned her back to go, the light\\r\\nbegan to pale and fade; the moment she was out of their sight the place\\r\\nwas black as night, save that now the smoky yellow-red of their lamps,\\r\\nwhich they thought had gone out long ago, cast a dusky glimmer around\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap07\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 7\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nWhat Is in a Name?\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor a time that seemed to them long, the two men stood waiting, while\\r\\nstill the Mother of Light did not return.  So long was she absent that\\r\\nthey began to grow anxious: how were they to find their way from the\\r\\nnatural hollows of the mountain crossed by goblin paths, if their lamps\\r\\nshould go out?  To spend the night there would mean to sit and wait\\r\\nuntil an earthquake rent the mountain, or the earth herself fell back\\r\\ninto the smelting furnace of the sun whence she had issued\\xe2\\x80\\x94for it was\\r\\nall night and no faintest dawn in the bosom of the world.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo long did they wait unrevisited, that, had there not been two of\\r\\nthem, either would at length have concluded the vision a home-born\\r\\nproduct of his own seething brain.  And their lamps were going out, for\\r\\nthey grew redder and smokier!  But they did not lose courage, for there\\r\\nis a kind of capillary attraction in the facing of two souls, that\\r\\nlifts faith quite beyond the level to which either could raise it\\r\\nalone: they knew that they had seen the lady of emeralds, and it was to\\r\\ngive them their own desire that she had gone from them, and neither\\r\\nwould yield for a moment to the half doubts and half dreads that awoke\\r\\nin his heart.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd still she who with her absence darkened their air did not return.\\r\\nThey grew weary, and sat down on the rocky floor, for wait they\\r\\nwould\\xe2\\x80\\x94indeed, wait they must.  Each set his lamp by his knee, and\\r\\nwatched it die.  Slowly it sank, dulled, looked lazy and stupid.  But\\r\\never as it sank and dulled, the image in his mind of the Lady of Light\\r\\ngrew stronger and clearer.  Together the two lamps panted and\\r\\nshuddered.  First one, then the other went out, leaving for a moment a\\r\\ngreat, red, evil-smelling snuff.  Then all was the blackness of\\r\\ndarkness up to their very hearts and everywhere around them.  Was it?\\r\\nNo.  Far away\\xe2\\x80\\x94it looked miles away\\xe2\\x80\\x94shone one minute faint point of\\r\\ngreen light\\xe2\\x80\\x94where, who could tell?  They only knew that it shone.  It\\r\\ngrew larger, and seemed to draw nearer, until at last, as they watched\\r\\nwith speechless delight and expectation, it seemed once more within\\r\\nreach of an outstretched hand.  Then it spread and melted away as\\r\\nbefore, and there were eyes\\xe2\\x80\\x94and a face\\xe2\\x80\\x94and a lovely form\\xe2\\x80\\x94and lo! the\\r\\nwhole cavern blazing with lights innumerable, and gorgeous, yet soft\\r\\nand interfused\\xe2\\x80\\x94so blended, indeed, that the eye had to search and see\\r\\nin order to separate distinct spots of special colour.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe moment they saw the speck in the vast distance they had risen and\\r\\nstood on their feet.  When it came nearer they bowed their heads.  Yet\\r\\nnow they looked with fearless eyes, for the woman that was old yet\\r\\nyoung was a joy to see, and filled their hearts with reverent delight.\\r\\nShe turned first to Peter.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I have known you long,\\' she said.  \\'I have met you going to and from\\r\\nthe mine, and seen you working in it for the last forty years.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'How should it be, madam, that a grand lady like you should take notice\\r\\nof a poor man like me?\\' said Peter, humbly, but more foolishly than he\\r\\ncould then have understood.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I am poor as well as rich,\\' said she.  \\'I, too, work for my bread, and\\r\\nI show myself no favour when I pay myself my own wages.  Last night\\r\\nwhen you sat by the brook, and Curdie told you about my pigeon, and my\\r\\nspinning, and wondered whether he could believe that he had actually\\r\\nseen me, I heard what you said to each other.  I am always about, as\\r\\nthe miners said the other night when they talked of me as Old Mother\\r\\nWotherwop.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe lovely lady laughed, and her laugh was a lightning of delight in\\r\\ntheir souls.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Yes,\\' she went on, \\'you have got to thank me that you are so poor,\\r\\nPeter.  I have seen to that, and it has done well for both you and me,\\r\\nmy friend.  Things come to the poor that can\\'t get in at the door of\\r\\nthe rich.  Their money somehow blocks it up.  It is a great privilege\\r\\nto be poor, Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x94one that no man ever coveted, and but a very few\\r\\nhave sought to retain, but one that yet many have learned to prize.\\r\\nYou must not mistake, however, and imagine it a virtue; it is but a\\r\\nprivilege, and one also that, like other privileges, may be terribly\\r\\nmisused.  Had you been rich, my Peter, you would not have been so good\\r\\nas some rich men I know.  And now I am going to tell you what no one\\r\\nknows but myself: you, Peter, and your wife both have the blood of the\\r\\nroyal family in your veins.  I have been trying to cultivate your\\r\\nfamily tree, every branch of which is known to me, and I expect Curdie\\r\\nto turn out a blossom on it.  Therefore I have been training him for a\\r\\nwork that must soon be done.  I was near losing him, and had to send my\\r\\npigeon.  Had he not shot it, that would have been better; but he\\r\\nrepented, and that shall be as good in the end.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe turned to Curdie and smiled.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Ma\\'am,\\' said Curdie, \\'may I ask questions?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Why not, Curdie?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Because I have been told, ma\\'am, that nobody must ask the king\\r\\nquestions.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'The king never made that law,\\' she answered, with some displeasure.\\r\\n\\'You may ask me as many as you please\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is, so long as they are\\r\\nsensible.  Only I may take a few thousand years to answer some of them.\\r\\nBut that\\'s nothing.  Of all things time is the cheapest.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Then would you mind telling me now, ma\\'am, for I feel very confused\\r\\nabout it\\xe2\\x80\\x94are you the Lady of the Silver Moon?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Yes, Curdie; you may call me that if you like.  What it means is true.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'And now I see you dark, and clothed in green, and the mother of all\\r\\nthe light that dwells in the stones of the earth!  And up there they\\r\\ncall you Old Mother Wotherwop!  And the Princess Irene told me you were\\r\\nher great-great-grandmother!  And you spin the spider threads, and take\\r\\ncare of a whole people of pigeons; and you are worn to a pale shadow\\r\\nwith old age; and are as young as anybody can be, not to be too young;\\r\\nand as strong, I do believe, as I am.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe lady stooped toward a large green stone bedded in the rock of the\\r\\nfloor, and looking like a well of grassy light in it.  She laid hold of\\r\\nit with her fingers, broke it out, and gave it to Peter. \\'There!\\' cried\\r\\nCurdie.  \\'I told you so.  Twenty men could not have done that.  And\\r\\nyour fingers are white and smooth as any lady\\'s in the land.  I don\\'t\\r\\nknow what to make of it.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I could give you twenty names more to call me, Curdie, and not one of\\r\\nthem would be a false one.  What does it matter how many names if the\\r\\nperson is one?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Ah!  But it is not names only, ma\\'am.  Look at what you were like last\\r\\nnight, and what I see you now!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Shapes are only dresses, Curdie, and dresses are only names.  That\\r\\nwhich is inside is the same all the time.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'But then how can all the shapes speak the truth?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'It would want thousands more to speak the truth, Curdie; and then they\\r\\ncould not.  But there is a point I must not let you mistake about.  It\\r\\nis one thing the shape I choose to put on, and quite another the shape\\r\\nthat foolish talk and nursery tale may please to put upon me.  Also, it\\r\\nis one thing what you or your father may think about me, and quite\\r\\nanother what a foolish or bad man may see in me.  For instance, if a\\r\\nthief were to come in here just now, he would think he saw the demon of\\r\\nthe mine, all in green flames, come to protect her treasure, and would\\r\\nrun like a hunted wild goat.  I should be all the same, but his evil\\r\\neyes would see me as I was not.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I think I understand,\\' said Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Peter,\\' said the lady, turning then to him, \\'you will have to give up\\r\\nCurdie for a little while.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'So long as he loves us, ma\\'am, that will not matter\\xe2\\x80\\x94much.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Ah! you are right there, my friend,\\' said the beautiful princess. And\\r\\nas she said it she put out her hand, and took the hard, horny hand of\\r\\nthe miner in it, and held it for a moment lovingly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I need say no more,\\' she added, \\'for we understand each other\\xe2\\x80\\x94you and\\r\\nI, Peter.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe tears came into Peter\\'s eyes.  He bowed his head in thankfulness,\\r\\nand his heart was much too full to speak.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen the great old, young, beautiful princess turned to Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Now, Curdie, are you ready?\\' she said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Yes, ma\\'am,\\' answered Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'You do not know what for.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'You do, ma\\'am.  That is enough.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'You could not have given me a better answer, or done more to prepare\\r\\nyourself, Curdie,\\' she returned, with one of her radiant smiles.  \\'Do\\r\\nyou think you will know me again?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I think so.  But how can I tell what you may look like next?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Ah, that indeed!  How can you tell?  Or how could I expect you should?\\r\\nBut those who know me well, know me whatever new dress or shape or name\\r\\nI may be in; and by and by you will have learned to do so too.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'But if you want me to know you again, ma\\'am, for certain sure,\\' said\\r\\nCurdie, \\'could you not give me some sign, or tell me something about\\r\\nyou that never changes\\xe2\\x80\\x94or some other way to know you, or thing to know\\r\\nyou by?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'No, Curdie; that would be to keep you from knowing me.  You must know\\r\\nme in quite another way from that.  It would not be the least use to\\r\\nyou or me either if I were to make you know me in that way. It would be\\r\\nbut to know the sign of Me\\xe2\\x80\\x94not to know me myself.  It would be no\\r\\nbetter than if I were to take this emerald out of my crown and give it\\r\\nto you to take home with you, and you were to call it me, and talk to\\r\\nit as if it heard and saw and loved you. Much good that would do you,\\r\\nCurdie!  No; you must do what you can to know me, and if you do, you\\r\\nwill.  You shall see me again in very different circumstances from\\r\\nthese, and, I will tell you so much, it may be in a very different\\r\\nshape.  But come now, I will lead you out of this cavern; my good Joan\\r\\nwill be getting too anxious about you.  One word more: you will allow\\r\\nthat the men knew little what they were talking about this morning,\\r\\nwhen they told all those tales of Old Mother Wotherwop; but did it\\r\\noccur to you to think how it was they fell to talking about me at all?\\r\\nIt was because I came to them; I was beside them all the time they were\\r\\ntalking about me, though they were far enough from knowing it, and had\\r\\nvery little besides foolishness to say.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs she spoke she turned and led the way from the cavern, which, as if a\\r\\ndoor had been closed, sank into absolute blackness behind them.  And\\r\\nnow they saw nothing more of the lady except the green star, which\\r\\nagain seemed a good distance in front of them, and to which they came\\r\\nno nearer, although following it at a quick pace through the mountain.\\r\\nSuch was their confidence in her guidance, however, and so fearless\\r\\nwere they in consequence, that they felt their way neither with hand\\r\\nnor foot, but walked straight on through the pitch-dark galleries.\\r\\nWhen at length the night of the upper world looked in at the mouth of\\r\\nthe mine, the green light seemed to lose its way among the stars, and\\r\\nthey saw it no more.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOut they came into the cool, blessed night.  It was very late, and only\\r\\nstarlight.  To their surprise, three paces away they saw, seated upon a\\r\\nstone, an old country-woman, in a cloak which they took for black.\\r\\nWhen they came close up to it, they saw it was red.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Good evening!\\' said Peter.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Good evening!\\' returned the old woman, in a voice as old as herself.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut Curdie took off his cap and said:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I am your servant, Princess.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe old woman replied:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Come to me in the dove tower tomorrow night, Curdie\\xe2\\x80\\x94alone.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I will, ma\\'am,\\' said Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo they parted, and father and son went home to wife and mother\\xe2\\x80\\x94two\\r\\npersons in one rich, happy woman.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap08\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 8\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCurdie\\'s Mission\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe next night Curdie went home from the mine a little earlier than\\r\\nusual, to make himself tidy before going to the dove tower.  The\\r\\nprincess had not appointed an exact time for him to be there; he would\\r\\ngo as near the time he had gone first as he could.  On his way to the\\r\\nbottom of the hill, he met his father coming up.  The sun was then\\r\\ndown, and the warm first of the twilight filled the evening.  He came\\r\\nrather wearily up the hill: the road, he thought, must have grown\\r\\nsteeper in parts since he was Curdie\\'s age.  His back was to the light\\r\\nof the sunset, which closed him all round in a beautiful setting, and\\r\\nCurdie thought what a grand-looking man his father was, even when he\\r\\nwas tired.  It is greed and laziness and selfishness, not hunger or\\r\\nweariness or cold, that take the dignity out of a man, and make him\\r\\nlook mean.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Ah, Curdie!  There you are!\\' he said, seeing his son come bounding\\r\\nalong as if it were morning with him and not evening.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'You look tired, Father,\\' said Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Yes, my boy.  I\\'m not so young as you.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Nor so old as the princess,\\' said Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Tell me this,\\' said Peter, \\'why do people talk about going downhill\\r\\nwhen they begin to get old?  It seems to me that then first they begin\\r\\nto go uphill.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'You looked to me, Father, when I caught sight of you, as if you had\\r\\nbeen climbing the hill all your life, and were soon to get to the top.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Nobody can tell when that will be,\\' returned Peter.  \\'We\\'re so ready\\r\\nto think we\\'re just at the top when it lies miles away.  But I must not\\r\\nkeep you, my boy, for you are wanted; and we shall be anxious to know\\r\\nwhat the princess says to you\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is, if she will allow you to tell\\r\\nus.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I think she will, for she knows there is nobody more to be trusted\\r\\nthan my father and mother,\\' said Curdie, with pride.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd away he shot, and ran, and jumped, and seemed almost to fly down\\r\\nthe long, winding, steep path, until he came to the gate of the king\\'s\\r\\nhouse.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere he met an unexpected obstruction: in the open door stood the\\r\\nhousekeeper, and she seemed to broaden herself out until she almost\\r\\nfilled the doorway.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'So!\\' she said, \\'it\\'s you, is it, young man?  You are the person that\\r\\ncomes in and goes out when he pleases, and keeps running up and down my\\r\\nstairs without ever saying by your leave, or even wiping his shoes, and\\r\\nalways leaves the door open!  Don\\'t you know this is my house?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'No, I do not,\\' returned Curdie respectfully.  \\'You forget, ma\\'am, that\\r\\nit is the king\\'s house.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'That is all the same.  The king left it to me to take care of\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\r\\nthat you shall know!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Is the king dead, ma\\'am, that he has left it to you?\\' asked Curdie,\\r\\nhalf in doubt from the self-assertion of the woman.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Insolent fellow!\\' exclaimed the housekeeper.  \\'Don\\'t you see by my\\r\\ndress that I am in the king\\'s service?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'And am I not one of his miners?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Ah! that goes for nothing.  I am one of his household.  You are an\\r\\nout-of-doors labourer.  You are a nobody.  You carry a pickaxe.  I\\r\\ncarry the keys at my girdle.  See!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'But you must not call one a nobody to whom the king has spoken,\\' said\\r\\nCurdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Go along with you!\\' cried the housekeeper, and would have shut the\\r\\ndoor in his face, had she not been afraid that when she stepped back he\\r\\nwould step in ere she could get it in motion, for it was very heavy and\\r\\nalways seemed unwilling to shut.  Curdie came a pace nearer.  She\\r\\nlifted the great house key from her side, and threatened to strike him\\r\\ndown with it, calling aloud on Mar and Whelk and Plout, the menservants\\r\\nunder her, to come and help her. Ere one of them could answer, however,\\r\\nshe gave a great shriek and turned and fled, leaving the door wide open.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie looked behind him, and saw an animal whose gruesome oddity even\\r\\nhe, who knew so many of the strange creatures, two of which were never\\r\\nthe same, that used to live inside the mountain with their masters the\\r\\ngoblins, had never seen equalled.  Its eyes were flaming with anger,\\r\\nbut it seemed to be at the housekeeper, for it came cowering and\\r\\ncreeping up and laid its head on the ground at Curdie\\'s feet.  Curdie\\r\\nhardly waited to look at it, however, but ran into the house, eager to\\r\\nget up the stairs before any of the men should come to annoy\\xe2\\x80\\x94he had no\\r\\nfear of their preventing him. Without halt or hindrance, though the\\r\\npassages were nearly dark, he reached the door of the princess\\'s\\r\\nworkroom, and knocked.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Come in,\\' said the voice of the princess.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie opened the door\\xe2\\x80\\x94but, to his astonishment, saw no room there.\\r\\nCould he have opened a wrong door?  There was the great sky, and the\\r\\nstars, and beneath he could see nothing only darkness! But what was\\r\\nthat in the sky, straight in front of him?  A great wheel of fire,\\r\\nturning and turning, and flashing out blue lights!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Come in, Curdie,\\' said the voice again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I would at once, ma\\'am,\\' said Curdie, \\'if I were sure I was standing\\r\\nat your door.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Why should you doubt it, Curdie?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Because I see neither walls nor floor, only darkness and the great\\r\\nsky.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'That is all right, Curdie.  Come in.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie stepped forward at once.  He was indeed, for the very crumb of a\\r\\nmoment, tempted to feel before him with his foot; but he saw that would\\r\\nbe to distrust the princess, and a greater rudeness he could not offer\\r\\nher.  So he stepped straight in\\xe2\\x80\\x94I will not say without a little\\r\\ntremble at the thought of finding no floor beneath his foot.  But that\\r\\nwhich had need of the floor found it, and his foot was satisfied.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNo sooner was he in than he saw that the great revolving wheel in the\\r\\nsky was the princess\\'s spinning wheel, near the other end of the room,\\r\\nturning very fast.  He could see no sky or stars any more, but the\\r\\nwheel was flashing out blue\\xe2\\x80\\x94oh, such lovely sky-blue light!\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\r\\nbehind it of course sat the princess, but whether an old woman as thin\\r\\nas a skeleton leaf, or a glorious lady as young as perfection, he could\\r\\nnot tell for the turning and flashing of the wheel.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Listen to the wheel,\\' said the voice which had already grown dear to\\r\\nCurdie: its very tone was precious like a jewel, not as a jewel, for no\\r\\njewel could compare with it in preciousness.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd Curdie listened and listened.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'What is it saying?\\' asked the voice.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'It is singing,\\' answered Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'What is it singing?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie tried to make out, but thought he could not; for no sooner had\\r\\nhe got hold of something than it vanished again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nYet he listened, and listened, entranced with delight.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Thank you, Curdie, said the voice.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Ma\\'am,\\' said Curdie, \\'I did try hard for a while, but I could not make\\r\\nanything of it.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Oh yes, you did, and you have been telling it to me!  Shall I tell you\\r\\nagain what I told my wheel, and my wheel told you, and you have just\\r\\ntold me without knowing it?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Please, ma\\'am.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen the lady began to sing, and her wheel spun an accompaniment to her\\r\\nsong, and the music of the wheel was like the music of an Aeolian harp\\r\\nblown upon by the wind that bloweth where it listeth. Oh, the sweet\\r\\nsounds of that spinning wheel!  Now they were gold, now silver, now\\r\\ngrass, now palm trees, now ancient cities, now rubies, now mountain\\r\\nbrooks, now peacock\\'s feathers, now clouds, now snowdrops, and now\\r\\nmid-sea islands.  But for the voice that sang through it all, about\\r\\nthat I have no words to tell.  It would make you weep if I were able to\\r\\ntell you what that was like, it was so beautiful and true and lovely.\\r\\nBut this is something like the words of its song:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br>\\r\\n</p><p class=\"poem\">\\r\\nThe stars are spinning their threads, <br>\\r\\nAnd the clouds are the dust that flies, <br>\\r\\nAnd the suns are weaving them up <br>\\r\\nFor the time when the sleepers shall rise.<br>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"poem\">\\r\\nThe ocean in music rolls, <br>\\r\\nAnd gems are turning to eyes, <br>\\r\\nAnd the trees are gathering souls <br>\\r\\nFor the day when the sleepers shall rise.<br>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"poem\">\\r\\nThe weepers are learning to smile, <br>\\r\\nAnd laughter to glean the sighs;<br>\\r\\nBurn and bury the care and guile, <br>\\r\\nFor the day when the sleepers shall rise.<br>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"poem\">\\r\\nOh, the dews and the moths and the daisy red, <br>\\r\\nThe larks and the glimmers and flows!  <br>\\r\\nThe lilies and sparrows and daily bread, <br>\\r\\nAnd the something that nobody knows!<br>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br>\\r\\n</p><p>\\r\\nThe princess stopped, her wheel stopped, and she laughed.  And her\\r\\nlaugh was sweeter than song and wheel; sweeter than running brook and\\r\\nsilver bell; sweeter than joy itself, for the heart of the laugh was\\r\\nlove.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Come now, Curdie, to this side of my wheel, and you will find me,\\' she\\r\\nsaid; and her laugh seemed sounding on still in the words, as if they\\r\\nwere made of breath that had laughed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie obeyed, and passed the wheel, and there she stood to receive\\r\\nhim!\\xe2\\x80\\x94fairer than when he saw her last, a little younger still, and\\r\\ndressed not in green and emeralds, but in pale blue, with a coronet of\\r\\nsilver set with pearls, and slippers covered with opals that gleamed\\r\\nevery colour of the rainbow.  It was some time before Curdie could take\\r\\nhis eyes from the marvel of her loveliness. Fearing at last that he was\\r\\nrude, he turned them away; and, behold, he was in a room that was for\\r\\nbeauty marvellous!  The lofty ceiling was all a golden vine, Whose\\r\\ngreat clusters of carbuncles, rubies, and chrysoberyls hung down like\\r\\nthe bosses of groined arches, and in its centre hung the most glorious\\r\\nlamp that human eyes ever saw\\xe2\\x80\\x94the Silver Moon itself, a globe of\\r\\nsilver, as it seemed, with a heart of light so wondrous potent that it\\r\\nrendered the mass translucent, and altogether radiant.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe room was so large that, looking back, he could scarcely see the end\\r\\nat which he entered; but the other was only a few yards from him\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\r\\nthere he saw another wonder: on a huge hearth a great fire was burning,\\r\\nand the fire was a huge heap of roses, and yet it was fire.  The smell\\r\\nof the roses filled the air, and the heat of the flames of them glowed\\r\\nupon his face.  He turned an inquiring look upon the lady, and saw that\\r\\nshe was now seated in an ancient chair, the legs of which were crusted\\r\\nwith gems, but the upper part like a nest of daisies and moss and green\\r\\ngrass.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Curdie,\\' she said in answer to his eyes, \\'you have stood more than one\\r\\ntrial already, and have stood them well: now I am going to put you to a\\r\\nharder.  Do you think you are prepared for it?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'How can I tell, ma\\'am,\\' he returned, \\'seeing I do not know what it is,\\r\\nor what preparation it needs?  Judge me yourself, ma\\'am.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'It needs only trust and obedience,\\' answered the lady.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I dare not say anything, ma\\'am.  If you think me fit, command me.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'It will hurt you terribly, Curdie, but that will be all; no real hurt\\r\\nbut much good will come to you from it.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie made no answer but stood gazing with parted lips in the lady\\'s\\r\\nface.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Go and thrust both your hands into that fire,\\' she said quickly,\\r\\nalmost hurriedly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie dared not stop to think.  It was much too terrible to think\\r\\nabout.  He rushed to the fire, and thrust both of his hands right into\\r\\nthe middle of the heap of flaming roses, and his arms halfway up to the\\r\\nelbows.  And it did hurt!  But he did not draw them back. He held the\\r\\npain as if it were a thing that would kill him if he let it go\\xe2\\x80\\x94as\\r\\nindeed it would have done.  He was in terrible fear lest it should\\r\\nconquer him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut when it had risen to the pitch that he thought he could bear it no\\r\\nlonger, it began to fall again, and went on growing less and less until\\r\\nby contrast with its former severity it had become rather pleasant.  At\\r\\nlast it ceased altogether, and Curdie thought his hands must be burned\\r\\nto cinders if not ashes, for he did not feel them at all.  The princess\\r\\ntold him to take them out and look at them.  He did so, and found that\\r\\nall that was gone of them was the rough, hard skin; they were white and\\r\\nsmooth like the princess\\'s.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Come to me,\\' she said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe obeyed and saw, to his surprise, that her face looked as if she had\\r\\nbeen weeping.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Oh, Princess!  What is the matter?\\' he cried.  \\'Did I make a noise and\\r\\nvex you?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'No, Curdie, she answered; \\'but it was very bad.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Did you feel it too then?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Of course I did.  But now it is over, and all is well.  Would you like\\r\\nto know why I made You put your hands in the fire?\\' Curdie looked at\\r\\nthem again\\xe2\\x80\\x94then said:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'To take the marks of the work off them and make them fit for the\\r\\nking\\'s court, I suppose.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'No, Curdie,\\' answered the princess, shaking her head, for she was not\\r\\npleased with the answer.  \\'It would be a poor way of making your hands\\r\\nfit for the king\\'s court to take off them signs of his service.  There\\r\\nis a far greater difference on them than that.  Do you feel none?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'No, ma\\'am.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'You will, though, by and by, when the time comes.  But perhaps even\\r\\nthen you might not know what had been given you, therefore I will tell\\r\\nyou.  Have you ever heard what some philosophers say\\xe2\\x80\\x94that men were all\\r\\nanimals once?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'No, ma\\'am.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'It is of no consequence.  But there is another thing that is of the\\r\\ngreatest consequence\\xe2\\x80\\x94this: that all men, if they do not take care, go\\r\\ndown the hill to the animals\\' country; that many men are actually, all\\r\\ntheir lives, going to be beasts.  People knew it once, but it is long\\r\\nsince they forgot it.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I am not surprised to hear it, ma\\'am, when I think of some of our\\r\\nminers.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Ah!  But you must beware, Curdie, how you say of this man or that man\\r\\nthat he is travelling beastward.  There are not nearly so many going\\r\\nthat way as at first sight you might think.  When you met your father\\r\\non the hill tonight, you stood and spoke together on the same spot; and\\r\\nalthough one of you was going up and the other coming down, at a little\\r\\ndistance no one could have told which was bound in the one direction\\r\\nand which in the other.  Just so two people may be at the same spot in\\r\\nmanners and behaviour, and yet one may be getting better and the other\\r\\nworse, which is just the greatest of all differences that could\\r\\npossibly exist between them.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'But ma\\'am,\\' said Curdie, \\'where is the good of knowing that there is\\r\\nsuch a difference, if you can never know where it is?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Now, Curdie, you must mind exactly what words I use, because although\\r\\nthe right words cannot do exactly what I want them to do, the wrong\\r\\nwords will certainly do what I do not want them to do. I did not say\\r\\nyou can never know.  When there is a necessity for your knowing, when\\r\\nyou have to do important business with this or that man, there is\\r\\nalways a way of knowing enough to keep you from any great blunder.  And\\r\\nas you will have important business to do by and by, and that with\\r\\npeople of whom you yet know nothing, it will be necessary that you\\r\\nshould have some better means than usual of learning the nature of them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Now listen.  Since it is always what they do, whether in their minds\\r\\nor their bodies, that makes men go down to be less than men, that is,\\r\\nbeasts, the change always comes first in their hands\\xe2\\x80\\x94and first of all\\r\\nin the inside hands, to which the outside ones are but as the gloves.\\r\\nThey do not know it of course; for a beast does not know that he is a\\r\\nbeast, and the nearer a man gets to being a beast the less he knows it.\\r\\nNeither can their best friends, or their worst enemies indeed, see any\\r\\ndifference in their hands, for they see only the living gloves of them.\\r\\nBut there are not a few who feel a vague something repulsive in the\\r\\nhand of a man who is growing a beast.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Now here is what the rose-fire has done for you: it has made your\\r\\nhands so knowing and wise, it has brought your real hands so near the\\r\\noutside of your flesh gloves, that you will henceforth be able to know\\r\\nat once the hand of a man who is growing into a beast; nay, more\\xe2\\x80\\x94you\\r\\nwill at once feel the foot of the beast he is growing, just as if there\\r\\nwere no glove made like a man\\'s hand between you and it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Hence of course it follows that you will be able often, and with\\r\\nfurther education in zoology, will be able always to tell, not only\\r\\nwhen a man is growing a beast, but what beast he is growing to, for you\\r\\nwill know the foot\\xe2\\x80\\x94what it is and what beast\\'s it is. According, then,\\r\\nto your knowledge of that beast will be your knowledge of the man you\\r\\nhave to do with.  Only there is one beautiful and awful thing about it,\\r\\nthat if any one gifted with this perception once uses it for his own\\r\\nends, it is taken from him, and then, not knowing that it is gone, he\\r\\nis in a far worse condition than before, for he trusts to what he has\\r\\nnot got.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'How dreadful!\\' Said Curdie.  \\'I must mind what I am about.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Yes, indeed, Curdie.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'But may not one sometimes make a mistake without being able to help\\r\\nit?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Yes.  But so long as he is not after his own ends, he will never make\\r\\na serious mistake.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I suppose you want me, ma\\'am, to warn every one whose hand tells me\\r\\nthat he is growing a beast\\xe2\\x80\\x94because, as you say, he does not know it\\r\\nhimself.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe princess smiled.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Much good that would do, Curdie!  I don\\'t say there are no cases in\\r\\nwhich it would be of use, but they are very rare and peculiar cases,\\r\\nand if such come you will know them.  To such a person there is in\\r\\ngeneral no insult like the truth.  He cannot endure it, not because he\\r\\nis growing a beast, but because he is ceasing to be a man.  It is the\\r\\ndying man in him that it makes uncomfortable, and he trots, or creeps,\\r\\nor swims, or flutters out of its way\\xe2\\x80\\x94calls it a foolish feeling, a\\r\\nwhim, an old wives\\' fable, a bit of priests\\' humbug, an effete\\r\\nsuperstition, and so on.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'And is there no hope for him?  Can nothing be done?  It\\'s so awful to\\r\\nthink of going down, down, down like that!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Even when it\\'s with his own will?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'That\\'s what seems to me to make it worst of all,\\' said Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'You are right,\\' answered the princess, nodding her head; \\'but there is\\r\\nthis amount of excuse to make for all such, remember\\xe2\\x80\\x94that they do not\\r\\nknow what or how horrid their coming fate is. Many a lady, so delicate\\r\\nand nice that she can bear nothing coarser than the finest linen to\\r\\ntouch her body, if she had a mirror that could show her the animal she\\r\\nis growing to, as it lies waiting within the fair skin and the fine\\r\\nlinen and the silk and the jewels, would receive a shock that might\\r\\npossibly wake her up.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Why then, ma\\'am, shouldn\\'t she have it?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe princess held her peace.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Come here, Lina,\\' she said after a long pause.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFrom somewhere behind Curdie, crept forward the same hideous animal\\r\\nwhich had fawned at his feet at the door, and which, without his\\r\\nknowing it, had followed him every step up the dove tower.  She ran to\\r\\nthe princess, and lay down flat at her feet, looking up at her with an\\r\\nexpression so pitiful that in Curdie\\'s heart it overcame all the\\r\\nludicrousness of her horrible mass of incongruities.  She had a very\\r\\nshort body, and very long legs made like an elephant\\'s, so that in\\r\\nlying down she kneeled with both pairs.  Her tail, which dragged on the\\r\\nfloor behind her, was twice as long and quite as thick as her body.\\r\\nHer head was something between that of a polar bear and a snake.  Her\\r\\neyes were dark green, with a yellow light in them.  Her under teeth\\r\\ncame up like a fringe of icicles, only very white, outside of her upper\\r\\nlip.  Her throat looked as if the hair had been plucked off.  It showed\\r\\na skin white and smooth.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Give Curdie a paw, Lina,\\' said the princess.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe creature rose, and, lifting a long foreleg, held up a great doglike\\r\\npaw to Curdie.  He took it gently.  But what a shudder, as of terrified\\r\\ndelight, ran through him, when, instead of the paw of a dog, such as it\\r\\nseemed to his eyes, he clasped in his great mining fist the soft, neat\\r\\nlittle hand of a child!  He took it in both of his, and held it as if\\r\\nhe could not let it go.  The green eyes stared at him with their yellow\\r\\nlight, and the mouth was turned up toward him with its constant half\\r\\ngrin; but here was the child\\'s hand!  If he could but pull the child\\r\\nout of the beast! His eyes sought the princess.  She was watching him\\r\\nwith evident satisfaction.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Ma\\'am, here is a child\\'s hand!\\' said Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Your gift does more for you than it promised.  It is yet better to\\r\\nperceive a hidden good than a hidden evil.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'But,\\' began Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I am not going to answer any more questions this evening,\\' interrupted\\r\\nthe princess.  \\'You have not half got to the bottom of the answers I\\r\\nhave already given you.  That paw in your hand now might almost teach\\r\\nyou the whole science of natural history\\xe2\\x80\\x94the heavenly sort, I mean.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I will think,\\' said Curdie.  \\'But oh! please! one word more: may I\\r\\ntell my father and mother all about it?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Certainly\\xe2\\x80\\x94though perhaps now it may be their turn to find it a little\\r\\ndifficult to believe that things went just as you must tell them.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'They shall see that I believe it all this time,\\' said Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Tell them that tomorrow morning you must set out for the court\\xe2\\x80\\x94not\\r\\nlike a great man, but just as poor as you are.  They had better not\\r\\nspeak about it.  Tell them also that it will be a long time before they\\r\\nhear of you again, but they must not lose heart.  And tell your father\\r\\nto lay that stone I gave him at night in a safe place\\xe2\\x80\\x94not because of\\r\\nthe greatness of its price, although it is such an emerald as no prince\\r\\nhas in his crown, but because it will be a news-bearer between you and\\r\\nhim.  As often as he gets at all anxious about you, he must take it and\\r\\nlay it in the fire, and leave it there when he goes to bed.  In the\\r\\nmorning he must find it in the ashes, and if it be as green as ever,\\r\\nthen all goes well with you; if it have lost colour, things go ill with\\r\\nyou; but if it be very pale indeed, then you are in great danger, and\\r\\nhe must come to me.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Yes, ma\\'am,\\' said Curdie.  \\'Please, am I to go now?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Yes,\\' answered the princess, and held out her hand to him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie took it, trembling with joy.  It was a very beautiful hand\\xe2\\x80\\x94not\\r\\nsmall, very smooth, but not very soft\\xe2\\x80\\x94and just the same to his\\r\\nfire-taught touch that it was to his eyes.  He would have stood there\\r\\nall night holding it if she had not gently withdrawn it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I will provide you a servant,\\' she said, \\'for your journey and to wait\\r\\nupon you afterward.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'But where am I to go, ma\\'am, and what am I to do?  You have given me\\r\\nno message to carry, neither have you said what I am wanted for. I go\\r\\nwithout a notion whether I am to walk this way or that, or what I am to\\r\\ndo when I get I don\\'t know where.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Curdie!\\' said the princess, and there was a tone of reminder in his\\r\\nown name as she spoke it, \\'did I not tell you to tell your father and\\r\\nmother that you were to set out for the court?  And you know that lies\\r\\nto the north.  You must learn to use far less direct directions than\\r\\nthat.  You must not be like a dull servant that needs to be told again\\r\\nand again before he will understand.  You have orders enough to start\\r\\nwith, and you will find, as you go on, and as you need to know, what\\r\\nyou have to do.  But I warn you that perhaps it will not look the least\\r\\nlike what you may have been fancying I should require of you.  I have\\r\\none idea of you and your work, and you have another.  I do not blame\\r\\nyou for that\\xe2\\x80\\x94you cannot help it yet; but you must be ready to let my\\r\\nidea, which sets you working, set your idea right.  Be true and honest\\r\\nand fearless, and all shall go well with you and your work, and all\\r\\nwith whom your work lies, and so with your parents\\xe2\\x80\\x94and me too,\\r\\nCurdie,\\' she added after a little pause.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe young miner bowed his head low, patted the strange head that lay at\\r\\nthe princess\\'s feet, and turned away.  As soon as he passed the\\r\\nspinning wheel, which looked, in the midst of the glorious room, just\\r\\nlike any wheel you might find in a country cottage\\xe2\\x80\\x94old and worn and\\r\\ndingy and dusty\\xe2\\x80\\x94the splendour of the place vanished, and he saw but\\r\\nthe big bare room he seemed at first to have entered, with the\\r\\nmoon\\xe2\\x80\\x94the princess\\'s moon no doubt\\xe2\\x80\\x94shining in at one of the windows\\r\\nupon the spinning wheel.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap09\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 9\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nHands\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie went home, pondering much, and told everything to his father and\\r\\nmother.  As the old princess had said, it was now their turn to find\\r\\nwhat they heard hard to believe.  If they had not been able to trust\\r\\nCurdie himself, they would have refused to believe more than the half\\r\\nof what he reported, then they would have refused that half too, and at\\r\\nlast would most likely for a time have disbelieved in the very\\r\\nexistence of the princess, what evidence their own senses had given\\r\\nthem notwithstanding.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor he had nothing conclusive to show in proof of what he told them.\\r\\nWhen he held out his hands to them, his mother said they looked as if\\r\\nhe had been washing them with soft soap, only they did smell of\\r\\nsomething nicer than that, and she must allow it was more like roses\\r\\nthan anything else she knew.  His father could not see any difference\\r\\nupon his hands, but then it was night, he said, and their poor little\\r\\nlamp was not enough for his old eyes.  As to the feel of them, each of\\r\\nhis own hands, he said, was hard and horny enough for two, and it must\\r\\nbe the fault of the dullness of his own thick skin that he felt no\\r\\nchange on Curdie\\'s palms.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Here, Curdie,\\' said his mother, \\'try my hand, and see what beast\\'s paw\\r\\nlies inside it.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'No, Mother,\\' answered Curdie, half beseeching, half indignant, \\'I will\\r\\nnot insult my new gift by making pretence to try it.  That would be\\r\\nmockery.  There is no hand within yours but the hand of a true woman,\\r\\nmy mother.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I should like you just to take hold of my hand though,\\' said his\\r\\nmother.  \\'You are my son, and may know all the bad there is in me.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen at once Curdie took her hand in his.  And when he had it, he kept\\r\\nit, stroking it gently with his other hand.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Mother,\\' he said at length, \\'your hand feels just like that of the\\r\\nprincess.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'What!  My horny, cracked, rheumatic old hand, with its big joints, and\\r\\nits short nails all worn down to the quick with hard work\\xe2\\x80\\x94like the\\r\\nhand of the beautiful princess!  Why, my child, you will make me fancy\\r\\nyour fingers have grown very dull indeed, instead of sharp and\\r\\ndelicate, if you talk such nonsense.  Mine is such an ugly hand I\\r\\nshould be ashamed to show it to any but one that loved me.  But love\\r\\nmakes all safe\\xe2\\x80\\x94doesn\\'t it, Curdie?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Well, Mother, all I can say is that I don\\'t feel a roughness, or a\\r\\ncrack, or a big joint, or a short nail.  Your hand feels just and\\r\\nexactly, as near as I can recollect, and it\\'s not more than two hours\\r\\nsince I had it in mine\\xe2\\x80\\x94well, I will say, very like indeed to that of\\r\\nthe old princess.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Go away, you flatterer,\\' said his mother, with a smile that showed how\\r\\nshe prized the love that lay beneath what she took for its hyperbole.\\r\\nThe praise even which one cannot accept is sweet from a true mouth.\\r\\n\\'If that is all your new gift can do, it won\\'t make a warlock of you,\\'\\r\\nshe added.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Mother, it tells me nothing but the truth,\\' insisted Curdie, \\'however\\r\\nunlike the truth it may seem.  It wants no gift to tell what anybody\\'s\\r\\noutside hands are like.  But by it I know your inside hands are like\\r\\nthe princess\\'s.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'And I am sure the boy speaks true,\\' said Peter.  \\'He only says about\\r\\nyour hand what I have known ever so long about yourself, Joan.  Curdie,\\r\\nyour mother\\'s foot is as pretty a foot as any lady\\'s in the land, and\\r\\nwhere her hand is not so pretty it comes of killing its beauty for you\\r\\nand me, my boy.  And I can tell you more, Curdie.  I don\\'t know much\\r\\nabout ladies and gentlemen, but I am sure your inside mother must be a\\r\\nlady, as her hand tells you, and I will try to say how I know it.  This\\r\\nis how: when I forget myself looking at her as she goes about her\\r\\nwork\\xe2\\x80\\x94and that happens often as I grow older\\xe2\\x80\\x94I fancy for a moment or\\r\\ntwo that I am a gentleman; and when I wake up from my little dream, it\\r\\nis only to feel the more strongly that I must do everything as a\\r\\ngentleman should.  I will try to tell you what I mean, Curdie.  If a\\r\\ngentleman\\xe2\\x80\\x94I mean a real gentleman, not a pretended one, of which sort\\r\\nthey say there are a many above ground\\xe2\\x80\\x94if a real gentleman were to\\r\\nlose all his money and come down to work in the mines to get bread for\\r\\nhis family\\xe2\\x80\\x94do you think, Curdie, he would work like the lazy ones?\\r\\nWould he try to do as little as he could for his wages?  I know the\\r\\nsort of the true gentleman pretty near as well as he does himself.  And\\r\\nmy wife, that\\'s your mother, Curdie, she\\'s a true lady, you may take my\\r\\nword for it, for it\\'s she that makes me want to be a true gentleman.\\r\\nWife, the boy is in the right about your hand.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Now, Father, let me feel yours,\\' said Curdie, daring a little more.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'No, no, my boy,\\' answered Peter.  \\'I don\\'t want to hear anything about\\r\\nmy hand or my head or my heart.  I am what I am, and I hope growing\\r\\nbetter, and that\\'s enough.  No, you shan\\'t feel my hand. You must go to\\r\\nbed, for you must start with the sun.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was not as if Curdie had been leaving them to go to prison, or to\\r\\nmake a fortune, and although they were sorry enough to lose him, they\\r\\nwere not in the least heartbroken or even troubled at his going.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs the princess had said he was to go like the poor man he was, Curdie\\r\\ncame down in the morning from his little loft dressed in his working\\r\\nclothes.  His mother, who was busy getting his breakfast for him, while\\r\\nhis father sat reading to her out of an old book, would have had him\\r\\nput on his holiday garments, which, she said, would look poor enough\\r\\namong the fine ladies and gentlemen he was going to.  But Curdie said\\r\\nhe did not know that he was going among ladies and gentlemen, and that\\r\\nas work was better than play, his workday clothes must on the whole be\\r\\nbetter than his playday Clothes; and as his father accepted the\\r\\nargument, his mother gave in.  When he had eaten his breakfast, she\\r\\ntook a pouch made of goatskin, with the long hair on it, filled it with\\r\\nbread and cheese, and hung it over his shoulder.  Then his father gave\\r\\nhim a stick he had cut for him in the wood, and he bade them good-bye\\r\\nrather hurriedly, for he was afraid of breaking down.  As he went out\\r\\nhe caught up his mattock and took it with him.  It had on the one side\\r\\na pointed curve of strong steel for loosening the earth and the ore,\\r\\nand on the other a steel hammer for breaking the stones and rocks.\\r\\nJust as he crossed the threshold the sun showed the first segment of\\r\\nhis disc above the horizon.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap10\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 10\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nThe Heath\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe had to go to the bottom of the hill to get into a country he could\\r\\ncross, for the mountains to the north were full of precipices, and it\\r\\nwould have been losing time to go that way.  Not until he had reached\\r\\nthe king\\'s house was it any use to turn northwards.  Many a look did he\\r\\nraise, as he passed it, to the dove tower, and as long as it was in\\r\\nsight, but he saw nothing of the lady of the pigeons.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOn and on he fared, and came in a few hours to a country where there\\r\\nwere no mountains more\\xe2\\x80\\x94only hills, with great stretches of desolate\\r\\nheath.  Here and there was a village, but that brought him little\\r\\npleasure, for the people were rougher and worse mannered than those in\\r\\nthe mountains, and as he passed through, the children came behind and\\r\\nmocked him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'There\\'s a monkey running away from the mines!\\' they cried. Sometimes\\r\\ntheir parents came out and encouraged them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'He doesn\\'t want to find gold for the king any longer\\xe2\\x80\\x94the lazybones!\\'\\r\\nthey would say.  \\'He\\'ll be well taxed down here though, and he won\\'t\\r\\nlike that either.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut it was little to Curdie that men who did not know what he was about\\r\\nshould not approve of his proceedings.  He gave them a merry answer now\\r\\nand then, and held diligently on his way.  When they got so rude as\\r\\nnearly to make him angry, he would treat them as he used to treat the\\r\\ngoblins, and sing his own songs to keep out their foolish noises.  Once\\r\\na child fell as he turned to run away after throwing a stone at him.\\r\\nHe picked him up, kissed him, and carried him to his mother.  The woman\\r\\nhad run out in terror when she saw the strange miner about, as she\\r\\nthought, to take vengeance on her boy.  When he put him in her arms,\\r\\nshe blessed him, and Curdie went on his way rejoicing.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd so the day went on, and the evening came, and in the middle of a\\r\\ngreat desolate heath he began to feel tired, and sat down under an\\r\\nancient hawthorn, through which every now and then a lone wind that\\r\\nseemed to come from nowhere and to go nowhither sighed and hissed.  It\\r\\nwas very old and distorted.  There was not another tree for miles all\\r\\naround.  It seemed to have lived so long, and to have been so torn and\\r\\ntossed by the tempests on that moor, that it had at last gathered a\\r\\nwind of its own, which got up now and then, tumbled itself about, and\\r\\nlay down again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie had been so eager to get on that he had eaten nothing since his\\r\\nbreakfast.  But he had had plenty of water, for Many little streams had\\r\\ncrossed his path.  He now opened the wallet his mother had given him,\\r\\nand began to eat his supper.  The sun was setting. A few clouds had\\r\\ngathered about the west, but there was not a single cloud anywhere else\\r\\nto be seen.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow Curdie did not know that this was a part of the country very hard\\r\\nto get through.  Nobody lived there, though many had tried to build in\\r\\nit.  Some died very soon.  Some rushed out of it.  Those who stayed\\r\\nlongest went raving mad, and died a terrible death. Such as walked\\r\\nstraight on, and did not spend a night there, got through well and were\\r\\nnothing the worse.  But those who slept even a single night in it were\\r\\nsure to meet with something they could never forget, and which often\\r\\nleft a mark everybody could read. And that old hawthorn Might have been\\r\\nenough for a warning\\xe2\\x80\\x94it looked so like a human being dried up and\\r\\ndistorted with age and suffering, with cares instead of loves, and\\r\\nthings instead of thoughts.  Both it and the heath around it, which\\r\\nstretched on all sides as far as he could see, were so withered that it\\r\\nwas impossible to say whether they were alive or not.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd while Curdie ate there came a change.  Clouds had gathered over his\\r\\nhead, and seemed drifting about in every direction, as if not\\r\\n\\'shepherded by the slow, unwilling wind,\\' but hunted in all directions\\r\\nby wolfish flaws across the plains of the sky.  The sun was going down\\r\\nin a storm of lurid crimson, and out of the west came a wind that felt\\r\\nred and hot the one moment, and cold and pale the other.  And very\\r\\nstrangely it sang in the dreary old hawthorn tree, and very cheerily it\\r\\nblew about Curdie, now making him creep close up to the tree for\\r\\nshelter from its shivery cold, now fan himself with his cap, it was so\\r\\nsultry and stifling.  It seemed to come from the deathbed of the sun,\\r\\ndying in fever and ague.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd as he gazed at the sun, now on the verge of the horizon, very large\\r\\nand very red and very dull\\xe2\\x80\\x94for though the clouds had broken away a\\r\\ndusty fog was spread all over the disc\\xe2\\x80\\x94Curdie saw something strange\\r\\nappear against it, moving about like a fly over its burning face.  This\\r\\nlooked as if it were coming out of the sun\\'s furnace heart, and was a\\r\\nliving creature of some kind surely; but its shape was very uncertain,\\r\\nbecause the dazzle of the light all around melted the outlines.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was growing larger, it must be approaching!  It grew so rapidly that\\r\\nby the time the sun was half down its head reached the top of the arch,\\r\\nand presently nothing but its legs were to be seen, crossing and\\r\\nrecrossing the face of the vanishing disc.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen the sun was down he could see nothing of it more, but in a moment\\r\\nhe heard its feet galloping over the dry crackling heather, and seeming\\r\\nto come straight for him.  He stood up, lifted his pickaxes and threw\\r\\nthe hammer end over his shoulder: he was going to have a fight for his\\r\\nlife!  And now it appeared again, vague, yet very awful, in the dim\\r\\ntwilight the sun had left behind.  But just before it reached him, down\\r\\nfrom its four long legs it dropped flat on the ground, and came\\r\\ncrawling towards him, wagging a huge tail as it came.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap11\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 11\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nLina\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was Lina.  All at once Curdie recognized her\\xe2\\x80\\x94the frightful creature\\r\\nhe had seen at the princess\\'s.  He dropped his pickaxes and held out\\r\\nhis hand.  She crept nearer and nearer, and laid her chin in his palm,\\r\\nand he patted her ugly head.  Then she crept away behind the tree, and\\r\\nlay down, panting hard.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie did not much like the idea of her being behind him. Horrible as\\r\\nshe was to look at, she seemed to his mind more horrible when he was\\r\\nnot looking at her.  But he remembered the child\\'s hand, and never\\r\\nthought of driving her away.  Now and then he gave a glance behind him,\\r\\nand there she lay flat, with her eyes closed and her terrible teeth\\r\\ngleaming between her two huge forepaws.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAfter his supper and his long day\\'s journey it was no wonder Curdie\\r\\nshould now be sleepy.  Since the sun set the air had been warm and\\r\\npleasant.  He lay down under the tree, closed his eyes, and thought to\\r\\nsleep.  He found himself mistaken, however.  But although he could not\\r\\nsleep, he was yet aware of resting delightfully.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPresently he heard a sweet sound of singing somewhere, such as he had\\r\\nnever heard before\\xe2\\x80\\x94a singing as of curious birds far off, which drew\\r\\nnearer and nearer.  At length he heard their wings, and, opening his\\r\\neyes, saw a number of very large birds, as it seemed, alighting around\\r\\nhim, still singing.  It was strange to hear song from the throats of\\r\\nsuch big birds.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd still singing, with large and round but not the less birdlike\\r\\nvoices, they began to weave a strange dance about him, moving their\\r\\nwings in time with their legs.  But the dance seemed somehow to be\\r\\ntroubled and broken, and to return upon itself in an eddy, in place of\\r\\nsweeping smoothly on.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd he soon learned, in the low short growls behind him, the cause of\\r\\nthe imperfection: they wanted to dance all round the tree, but Lina\\r\\nwould not permit them to come on her side.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow curdie liked the birds, and did not altogether like Lina.  But\\r\\nneither, nor both together, made a reason for driving away the\\r\\nprincess\\'s creature.  Doubtless she had been the goblins\\' creature, but\\r\\nthe last time he saw her was in the king\\'s house and the dove tower,\\r\\nand at the old princess\\'s feet.  So he left her to do as she would, and\\r\\nthe dance of the birds continued only a semicircle, troubled at the\\r\\nedges, and returning upon itself.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut their song and their motions, nevertheless, and the waving of their\\r\\nwings, began at length to make him very sleepy.  All the time he had\\r\\nkept doubting whether they could really be birds, and the sleepier he\\r\\ngot, the more he imagined them something else, but he suspected no harm.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSuddenly, just as he was sinking beneath the waves of slumber, he awoke\\r\\nin fierce pain.  The birds were upon him\\xe2\\x80\\x94all over him\\xe2\\x80\\x94and had begun\\r\\nto tear him with beaks and claws.  He had but time, however, to feel\\r\\nthat he could not move under their weight, when they set up a hideous\\r\\nscreaming, and scattered like a cloud.  Lina was among them, snapping\\r\\nand striking with her paws, while her tail knocked them over and over.\\r\\nBut they flew up, gathered, and descended on her in a swarm, perching\\r\\nupon every part of her body, so that he could see only a huge misshapen\\r\\nmass, which seemed to go rolling away into the darkness.  He got up and\\r\\ntried to follow, but could see nothing, and after wandering about\\r\\nhither and thither for some time, found himself again beside the\\r\\nhawthorn.  He feared greatly that the birds had been too much for Lina,\\r\\nand had torn her to pieces.  In a little while, however, she came\\r\\nlimping back, and lay down in her old place.  Curdie also lay down,\\r\\nbut, from the pain of his wounds, there was no sleep for him.  When the\\r\\nlight came he found his clothes a good deal torn and his skin as well,\\r\\nbut gladly wondered why the wicked birds had not at once attacked his\\r\\neyes.  Then he turned, looking for Lina.  She rose and crept to him.\\r\\nBut she was in far worse plight than he\\xe2\\x80\\x94plucked and gashed and torn\\r\\nwith the beaks and claws of the birds, especially about the bare part\\r\\nof her neck, so that she was pitiful to see.  And those worst wounds\\r\\nshe could not reach to lick.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Poor Lina!\\' said Curdie, \\'you got all those helping me.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe wagged her tail, and made it clear she understood him.  Then it\\r\\nflashed upon Curdie\\'s mind that perhaps this was the companion the\\r\\nprincess had promised him.  For the princess did so many things\\r\\ndifferently from what anybody looked for!  Lina was no beauty\\r\\ncertainly, but already, the first night, she had saved his life.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Come along, Lina,\\' he said, \\'we want water.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe put her nose to the earth, and after snuffing for a moment, darted\\r\\noff in a straight line.  Curdie followed.  The ground was so uneven,\\r\\nthat after losing sight of her many times, at last he seemed to have\\r\\nlost her altogether.  In a few minutes, however, he came upon her\\r\\nwaiting for him.  Instantly she darted off again. After he had lost and\\r\\nfound her again many times, he found her the last time lying beside a\\r\\ngreat stone.  As soon as he came up she began scratching at it with her\\r\\npaws.  When he had raised it an inch or two, she shoved in first her\\r\\nnose and then her teeth, and lifted with all the might of her neck.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen at length between them they got it up, there was a beautiful\\r\\nlittle well.  He filled his cap with the clearest and sweetest water,\\r\\nand drank.  Then he gave to Lina, and she drank plentifully. Next he\\r\\nwashed her wounds very carefully.  And as he did so, he noted how much\\r\\nthe bareness of her neck added to the strange repulsiveness of her\\r\\nappearance.  Then he bethought him of the goatskin wallet his mother\\r\\nhad given him, and taking it from his shoulders, tried whether it would\\r\\ndo to make a collar of for the poor animal.  He found there was just\\r\\nenough, and the hair so similar in colour to Lina\\'s, that no one could\\r\\nsuspect it of having grown somewhere else.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe took his knife, ripped up the seams of the wallet, and began trying\\r\\nthe skin to her neck.  It was plain she understood perfectly what he\\r\\nwished, for she endeavoured to hold her neck conveniently, turning it\\r\\nthis way and that while he contrived, with his rather scanty material,\\r\\nto make the collar fit.  As his mother had taken care to provide him\\r\\nwith needles and thread, he soon had a nice gorget ready for her.  He\\r\\nlaced it on with one of his boot laces, which its long hair covered.\\r\\nPoor Lina looked much better in it. Nor could any one have called it a\\r\\npiece of finery.  If ever green eyes with a yellow light in them looked\\r\\ngrateful, hers did.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs they had no longer any bag to carry them in, Curdie and Lina now ate\\r\\nwhat was left of the provisions.  Then they set out again upon their\\r\\njourney.  For seven days it lasted.  They met with various adventures,\\r\\nand in all of them Lina proved so helpful, and so ready to risk her\\r\\nlife for the sake of her companion, that Curdie grew not merely very\\r\\nfond but very trustful of her; and her ugliness, which at first only\\r\\nmoved his pity, now actually increased his affection for her.  One day,\\r\\nlooking at her stretched on the grass before him, he said:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Oh, Lina!  If the princess would but burn you in her fire of roses!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe looked up at him, gave a mournful whine like a dog, and laid her\\r\\nhead on his feet.  What or how much he could not tell, but clearly she\\r\\nhad gathered something from his words.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap12\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 12\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nMore Creatures\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOne day from morning till night they had been passing through a forest.\\r\\nAs soon as the sun was down Curdie began to be aware that there were\\r\\nmore in it than themselves.  First he saw only the swift rush of a\\r\\nfigure across the trees at some distance.  Then he saw another and then\\r\\nanother at shorter intervals.  Then he saw others both farther off and\\r\\nnearer.  At last, missing Lina and looking about after her, he saw an\\r\\nappearance as marvellous as herself steal up to her, and begin\\r\\nconversing with her after some beast fashion which evidently she\\r\\nunderstood.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPresently what seemed a quarrel arose between them, and stranger noises\\r\\nfollowed, mingled with growling.  At length it came to a fight, which\\r\\nhad not lasted long, however, before the creature of the wood threw\\r\\nitself upon its back, and held up its paws to Lina. She instantly\\r\\nwalked on, and the creature got up and followed her. They had not gone\\r\\nfar before another strange animal appeared, approaching Lina, when\\r\\nprecisely the same thing was repeated, the vanquished animal rising and\\r\\nfollowing with the former.  Again, and yet again, and again, a fresh\\r\\nanimal came up, seemed to be reasoned and certainly was fought with and\\r\\novercome by Lina, until at last, before they were out of the wood, she\\r\\nwas followed by forty-nine of the most grotesquely ugly, the most\\r\\nextravagantly abnormal animals imagination can conceive.  To describe\\r\\nthem were a hopeless task.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI knew a boy who used to make animals out of heather roots. Wherever he\\r\\ncould find four legs, he was pretty sure to find a head and a tail.\\r\\nHis beasts were a most comic menagerie, and right fruitful of laughter.\\r\\nBut they were not so grotesque and extravagant as Lina and her\\r\\nfollowers.  One of them, for instance, was like a boa constrictor\\r\\nwalking on four little stumpy legs near its tail.  About the same\\r\\ndistance from its head were two little wings, which it was forever\\r\\nfluttering as if trying to fly with them.  Curdie thought it fancied it\\r\\ndid fly with them, when it was merely plodding on busily with its four\\r\\nlittle stumps.  How it managed to keep up he could not think, till once\\r\\nwhen he missed it from the group: the same moment he caught sight of\\r\\nsomething at a distance plunging at an awful serpentine rate through\\r\\nthe trees, and presently, from behind a huge ash, this same creature\\r\\nfell again into the group, quietly waddling along on its four stumps.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWatching it after this, he saw that, when it was not able to keep up\\r\\nany longer, and they had all got a little space ahead, it shot into the\\r\\nwood away from the route, and made a great round, serpentine alone in\\r\\nhuge billows of motion, devouring the ground, undulating awfully,\\r\\ngalloping as if it were all legs together, and its four stumps nowhere.\\r\\nIn this mad fashion it shot ahead, and, a few minutes after, toddled in\\r\\nagain among the rest, walking peacefully and somewhat painfully on its\\r\\nfew fours.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFrom the time it takes to describe one of them it will be readily seen\\r\\nthat it would hardly do to attempt a description of each of the\\r\\nforty-nine.  They were not a goodly company, but well worth\\r\\ncontemplating, nevertheless; and Curdie had been too long used to the\\r\\ngoblins\\' creatures in the mines and on the mountain, to feel the least\\r\\nuncomfortable at being followed by such a herd.  On the contrary, the\\r\\nmarvellous vagaries of shape they manifested amused him greatly, and\\r\\nshortened the journey much.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBefore they were all gathered, however, it had got so dark that he\\r\\ncould see some of them only a part at a time, and every now and then,\\r\\nas the company wandered on, he would be startled by some extraordinary\\r\\nlimb or feature, undreamed of by him before, thrusting itself out of\\r\\nthe darkness into the range of his ken. Probably there were some of his\\r\\nold acquaintances among them, although such had been the conditions of\\r\\nsemi-darkness, in which alone he had ever seen any of them, that it was\\r\\nnot like he would be able to identify any of them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOn they marched solemnly, almost in silence, for either with feet or\\r\\nvoice the creatures seldom made any noise.  By the time they reached\\r\\nthe outside of the wood it was morning twilight.  Into the open trooped\\r\\nthe strange torrent of deformity, each one following Lina.  Suddenly\\r\\nshe stopped, turned towards them, and said something which they\\r\\nunderstood, although to Curdie\\'s ear the sounds she made seemed to have\\r\\nno articulation.  Instantly they all turned, and vanished in the\\r\\nforest, and Lina alone came trotting lithely and clumsily after her\\r\\nmaster.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap13\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 13\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nThe Baker\\'s Wife\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey were now passing through a lovely country of hill and dale and\\r\\nrushing stream.  The hills were abrupt, with broken chasms for\\r\\nwatercourses, and deep little valleys full of trees.  But now and then\\r\\nthey came to a larger valley, with a fine river, whose level banks and\\r\\nthe adjacent meadows were dotted all over with red and white kine,\\r\\nwhile on the fields above, that sloped a little to the foot of the\\r\\nhills, grew oats and barley and wheat, and on the sides of the hills\\r\\nthemselves vines hung and chestnuts rose.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey came at last to a broad, beautiful river, up which they must go to\\r\\narrive at the city of Gwyntystorm, where the king had his court.  As\\r\\nthey went the valley narrowed, and then the river, but still it was\\r\\nwide enough for large boats.  After this, while the river kept its\\r\\nsize, the banks narrowed, until there was only room for a road between\\r\\nthe river and the great Cliffs that overhung it. At last river and road\\r\\ntook a sudden turn, and lo! a great rock in the river, which dividing\\r\\nflowed around it, and on the top of the rock the city, with lofty walls\\r\\nand towers and battlements, and above the city the palace of the king,\\r\\nbuilt like a strong castle. But the fortifications had long been\\r\\nneglected, for the whole country was now under one king, and all men\\r\\nsaid there was no more need for weapons or walls.  No man pretended to\\r\\nlove his neighbour, but every one said he knew that peace and quiet\\r\\nbehaviour was the best thing for himself, and that, he said, was quite\\r\\nas useful, and a great deal more reasonable.  The city was prosperous\\r\\nand rich, and if everybody was not comfortable, everybody else said he\\r\\nought to be.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen Curdie got up opposite the mighty rock, which sparkled all over\\r\\nwith crystals, he found a narrow bridge, defended by gates and\\r\\nportcullis and towers with loopholes.  But the gates stood wide open,\\r\\nand were dropping from their great hinges; the portcullis was eaten\\r\\naway with rust, and clung to the grooves evidently immovable; while the\\r\\nloopholed towers had neither floor nor roof, and their tops were fast\\r\\nfilling up their interiors.  Curdie thought it a pity, if only for\\r\\ntheir old story, that they should be thus neglected.  But everybody in\\r\\nthe city regarded these signs of decay as the best proof of the\\r\\nprosperity of the place.  Commerce and self-interest, they said, had\\r\\ngot the better of violence, and the troubles of the past were whelmed\\r\\nin the riches that flowed in at their open gates.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIndeed, there was one sect of philosophers in it which taught that it\\r\\nwould be better to forget all the past history of the city, were it not\\r\\nthat its former imperfections taught its present inhabitants how\\r\\nsuperior they and their times were, and enabled them to glory over\\r\\ntheir ancestors.  There were even certain quacks in the city who\\r\\nadvertised pills for enabling people to think well of themselves, and\\r\\nsome few bought of them, but most laughed, and said, with evident\\r\\ntruth, that they did not require them.  Indeed, the general theme of\\r\\ndiscourse when they met was, how much wiser they were than their\\r\\nfathers.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie crossed the river, and began to ascend the winding road that led\\r\\nup to the city.  They met a good many idlers, and all stared at them.\\r\\nIt was no wonder they should stare, but there was an unfriendliness in\\r\\ntheir looks which Curdie did not like.  No one, however, offered them\\r\\nany molestation: Lina did not invite liberties.  After a long ascent,\\r\\nthey reached the principal gate of the city and entered.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe street was very steep, ascending toward the palace, which rose in\\r\\ngreat strength above all the houses.  Just as they entered, a baker,\\r\\nwhose shop was a few doors inside the gate, came out in his white\\r\\napron, and ran to the shop of his friend, the barber, on the opposite\\r\\nside of the way.  But as he ran he stumbled and fell heavily.  Curdie\\r\\nhastened to help him up, and found he had bruised his forehead badly.\\r\\nHe swore grievously at the stone for tripping him up, declaring it was\\r\\nthe third time he had fallen over it within the last month; and saying\\r\\nwhat was the king about that he allowed such a stone to stick up\\r\\nforever on the main street of his royal residence of Gwyntystorm!  What\\r\\nwas a king for if he would not take care of his people\\'s heads!  And he\\r\\nstroked his forehead tenderly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Was it your head or your feet that ought to bear the blame of your\\r\\nfall?\\' asked Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Why, you booby of a miner!  My feet, of course,\\' answered the baker.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Nay, then,\\' said Curdie, \\'the king can\\'t be to blame.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Oh, I see!\\' said the baker.  \\'You\\'re laying a trap for me.  Of course,\\r\\nif you come to that, it was my head that ought to have looked after my\\r\\nfeet.  But it is the king\\'s part to look after us all, and have his\\r\\nstreets smooth.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Well, I don\\'t see, said Curdie, \\'why the king should take care of the\\r\\nbaker, when the baker\\'s head won\\'t take care of the baker\\'s feet.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Who are you to make game of the king\\'s baker?\\' cried the man in a rage.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut, instead of answering, Curdie went up to the bump on the street\\r\\nwhich had repeated itself on the baker\\'s head, and turning the hammer\\r\\nend of his mattock, struck it such a blow that it flew wide in pieces.\\r\\nBlow after blow he struck until he had levelled it with the street.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut out flew the barber upon him in a rage. \\'What do you break my\\r\\nwindow for, you rascal, with your pickaxe?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I am very sorry,\\' said Curdie.  \\'It must have been a bit of stone that\\r\\nflew from my mattock.  I couldn\\'t help it, you know.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Couldn\\'t help it!  A fine story!  What do you go breaking the rock\\r\\nfor\\xe2\\x80\\x94the very rock upon which the city stands?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Look at your friend\\'s forehead,\\' said Curdie.  \\'See what a lump he has\\r\\ngot on it with falling over that same stone.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'What\\'s that to my window?\\' cried the barber.  \\'His forehead can mend\\r\\nitself; my poor window can\\'t.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'But he\\'s the king\\'s baker,\\' said Curdie, more and more surprised at\\r\\nthe man\\'s anger.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'What\\'s that to me?  This is a free city.  Every man here takes care of\\r\\nhimself, and the king takes care of us all.  I\\'ll have the price of my\\r\\nwindow out of you, or the exchequer shall pay for it.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSomething caught Curdie\\'s eye.  He stooped, picked up a piece of the\\r\\nstone he had just broken, and put it in his pocket.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I suppose you are going to break another of my windows with that\\r\\nstone!\\' said the barber.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Oh no,\\' said Curdie.  \\'I didn\\'t mean to break your window, and I\\r\\ncertainly won\\'t break another.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Give me that stone,\\' said the barber.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie gave it him, and the barber threw it over the city wall.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I thought you wanted the stone,\\' said Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'No, you fool!\\' answered the barber.  \\'What should I want with a stone?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie stooped and picked up another.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Give me that stone,\\' said the barber.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'No,\\' answered Curdie.  \\'You have just told me YOU don\\'t want a stone,\\r\\nand I do.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe barber took Curdie by the collar.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Come, now!  You pay me for that window.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'How much?\\' asked Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe barber said, \\'A crown.\\'  But the baker, annoyed at the\\r\\nheartlessness of the barber, in thinking more of his broken window than\\r\\nthe bump on his friend\\'s forehead, interfered.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'No, no,\\' he said to Curdie; \\'don\\'t you pay any such sum.  A little\\r\\npane like that cost only a quarter.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Well, to be certain,\\' said Curdie, \\'I\\'ll give a half.\\'  For he doubted\\r\\nthe baker as well as the barber.  \\'Perhaps one day, if he finds he has\\r\\nasked too much, he will bring me the difference.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Ha! ha!\\' laughed the barber.  \\'A fool and his money are soon parted.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut as he took the coin from Curdie\\'s hand he grasped it in affected\\r\\nreconciliation and real satisfaction.  In Curdie\\'s, his was the cold\\r\\nsmooth leathery palm of a monkey.  He looked up, almost expecting to\\r\\nsee him pop the money in his cheek; but he had not yet got so far as\\r\\nthat, though he was well on the road to it: then he would have no other\\r\\npocket.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I\\'m glad that stone is gone, anyhow,\\' said the baker.  \\'It was the\\r\\nbane of my life.  I had no idea how easy it was to remove it.  Give me\\r\\nyour pickaxes young miner, and I will show you how a baker can make the\\r\\nstones fly.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe caught the tool out of Curdie\\'s hand, and flew at one of the\\r\\nfoundation stones of the gateway.  But he jarred his arm terribly,\\r\\nscarcely chipped the stone, dropped the mattock with a cry of pain, and\\r\\nran into his own shop.  Curdie picked up his implement, and, looking\\r\\nafter the baker, saw bread in the window, and followed him in.  But the\\r\\nbaker, ashamed of himself, and thinking he was coming to laugh at him,\\r\\npopped out of the back door, and when Curdie entered, the baker\\'s wife\\r\\ncame from the bakehouse to serve him. Curdie requested to know the\\r\\nprice of a certain good-sized loaf.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow the baker\\'s wife had been watching what had passed since first her\\r\\nhusband ran out of the shop, and she liked the look of Curdie. Also she\\r\\nwas more honest than her husband.  Casting a glance to the back door,\\r\\nshe replied:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'That is not the best bread.  I will sell you a loaf of what we bake\\r\\nfor ourselves.\\'  And when she had spoken she laid a finger on her lips.\\r\\n\\'Take care of yourself in this place, MY son,\\' she added.  \\'They do not\\r\\nlove strangers.  I was once a stranger here, and I know what I say.\\'\\r\\nThen fancying she heard her husband, \\'That is a strange animal you\\r\\nhave,\\' she said, in a louder voice.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Yes,\\' answered Curdie.  \\'She is no beauty, but she is very good, and\\r\\nwe love each other.  Don\\'t we, Lina?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLina looked up and whined.  Curdie threw her the half of his loaf,\\r\\nwhich she ate, while her master and the baker\\'s wife talked a little.\\r\\nThen the baker\\'s wife gave them some water, and Curdie having paid for\\r\\nhis loaf, he and Lina went up the street together.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap14\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 14\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nThe Dogs of Gwyntystorm\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe steep street led them straight up to a large market place with\\r\\nbutchers\\' shops, about which were many dogs.  The moment they caught\\r\\nsight of Lina, one and all they came rushing down upon her, giving her\\r\\nno chance of explaining herself.  When Curdie saw the dogs coming he\\r\\nheaved up his mattock over his shoulder, and was ready, if they would\\r\\nhave it so.  Seeing him thus prepared to defend his follower, a great\\r\\nugly bulldog flew at him.  With the first blow Curdie struck him\\r\\nthrough the brain and the brute fell dead at his feet.  But he could\\r\\nnot at once recover his weapon, which stuck in the skull of his foe,\\r\\nand a huge mastiff, seeing him thus hampered, flew at him next.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow Lina, who had shown herself so brave upon the road thither, had\\r\\ngrown shy upon entering the city, and kept always at Curdie\\'s heel. But\\r\\nit was her turn now.  The moment she saw her master in danger she\\r\\nseemed to go mad with rage.  As the mastiff jumped at Curdie\\'s throat,\\r\\nLina flew at him, seized him with her tremendous jaws, gave one roaring\\r\\ngrind, and he lay beside the bulldog with his neck broken.  They were\\r\\nthe best dogs in the market, after the judgement of the butchers of\\r\\nGwyntystorm.  Down came their masters, knives in hand.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie drew himself up fearlessly, mattock on shoulder, and awaited\\r\\ntheir coming, while at his heel his awful attendant showed not only her\\r\\noutside fringe of icicle teeth, but a double row of right serviceable\\r\\nfangs she wore inside her mouth, and her green eyes flashed yellow as\\r\\ngold.  The butchers, not liking the look of either of them or of the\\r\\ndogs at their feet, drew back, and began to remonstrate in the manner\\r\\nof outraged men.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Stranger,\\' said the first, \\'that bulldog is mine.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Take him, then,\\' said Curdie, indignant.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'You\\'ve killed him!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Yes\\xe2\\x80\\x94else he would have killed me.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'That\\'s no business of mine.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'No?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'No.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'That makes it the more mine, then.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'This sort of thing won\\'t do, you know,\\' said the other butcher.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'That\\'s true,\\' said Curdie. \\'That\\'s my mastiff,\\' said the butcher.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'And as he ought to be,\\' said Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Your brute shall be burned alive for it,\\' said the butcher.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Not yet,\\' answered Curdie.  \\'We have done no wrong.  We were walking\\r\\nquietly up your street when your dogs flew at us.  If you don\\'t teach\\r\\nyour dogs how to treat strangers, you must take the consequences.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'They treat them quite properly,\\' said the butcher.  \\'What right has\\r\\nany one to bring an abomination like that into our city?  The horror is\\r\\nenough to make an idiot of every child in the place.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'We are both subjects of the king, and my poor animal can\\'t help her\\r\\nlooks.  How would you like to be served like that because you were\\r\\nugly?  She\\'s not a bit fonder of her looks than you are\\xe2\\x80\\x94only what can\\r\\nshe do to change them?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I\\'ll do to change them,\\' said the fellow.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThereupon the butchers brandished their long knives and advanced,\\r\\nkeeping their eyes upon Lina.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Don\\'t be afraid, Lina,\\' cried Curdie.  \\'I\\'ll kill one\\xe2\\x80\\x94you kill the\\r\\nother.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLina gave a howl that might have terrified an army, and crouched ready\\r\\nto spring.  The butchers turned and ran.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy this time a great crowd had gathered behind the butchers, and in it\\r\\na number of boys returning from school who began to stone the\\r\\nstrangers.  It was a way they had with man or beast they did not expect\\r\\nto make anything by.  One of the stones struck Lina; she caught it in\\r\\nher teeth and crunched it so that it fell in gravel from her mouth.\\r\\nSome of the foremost of the crowd saw this, and it terrified them.\\r\\nThey drew back; the rest took fright from their retreat; the panic\\r\\nspread; and at last the crowd scattered in all directions.  They ran,\\r\\nand cried out, and said the devil and his dam were come to Gwyntystorm.\\r\\nSo Curdie and Lina were left standing unmolested in the market place.\\r\\nBut the terror of them spread throughout the city, and everybody began\\r\\nto shut and lock his door so that by the time the setting sun shone\\r\\ndown the street, there was not a shop left open, for fear of the devil\\r\\nand his horrible dam.  But all the upper windows within sight of them\\r\\nwere crowded with heads watching them where they stood lonely in the\\r\\ndeserted market place.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie looked carefully all round, but could not see one open door. He\\r\\ncaught sight of the sign of an inn, however, and laying down his\\r\\nmattock, and telling Lina to take care of it, walked up to the door of\\r\\nit and knocked.  But the people in the house, instead of opening the\\r\\ndoor, threw things at him from the windows.  They would not listen to a\\r\\nword he said, but sent him back to Lina with the blood running down his\\r\\nface.  When Lina saw that she leaped up in a fury and was rushing at\\r\\nthe house, into which she would certainly have broken; but Curdie\\r\\ncalled her, and made her lie down beside him while he bethought him\\r\\nwhat next he should do.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Lina,\\' he said, \\'the people keep their gates open, but their houses\\r\\nand their hearts shut.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs if she knew it was her presence that had brought this trouble upon\\r\\nhim, she rose and went round and round him, purring like a tigress, and\\r\\nrubbing herself against his legs.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow there was one little thatched house that stood squeezed in between\\r\\ntwo tall gables, and the sides of the two great houses shot out\\r\\nprojecting windows that nearly met across the roof of the little one,\\r\\nso that it lay in the street like a doll\\'s house.  In this house lived\\r\\na poor old woman, with a grandchild.  And because she never gossiped or\\r\\nquarrelled, or chaffered in the market, but went without what she could\\r\\nnot afford, the people called her a witch, and would have done her many\\r\\nan ill turn if they had not been afraid of her.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow while Curdie was looking in another direction the door opened, and\\r\\nout came a little dark-haired, black-eyed, gypsy-looking child, and\\r\\ntoddled across the market place toward the outcasts.  The moment they\\r\\nsaw her coming, Lina lay down flat on the road, and with her two huge\\r\\nforepaws covered her mouth, while Curdie went to meet her, holding out\\r\\nhis arms.  The little one came straight to him, and held up her mouth\\r\\nto be kissed.  Then she took him by the hand, and drew him toward the\\r\\nhouse, and Curdie yielded to the silent invitation.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut when Lina rose to follow, the child shrank from her, frightened a\\r\\nlittle.  Curdie took her up, and holding her on one arm, patted Lina\\r\\nwith the other hand.  Then the child wanted also to pat doggy, as she\\r\\ncalled her by a right bountiful stretch of courtesy, and having once\\r\\npatted her, nothing would serve but Curdie must let her have a ride on\\r\\ndoggy.  So he set her on Lina\\'s back, holding her hand, and she rode\\r\\nhome in merry triumph, all unconscious of the hundreds of eyes staring\\r\\nat her foolhardiness from the windows about the market place, or the\\r\\nmurmur of deep disapproval that rose from as many lips.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt the door stood the grandmother to receive them.  She caught the\\r\\nchild to her bosom with delight at her courage, welcomed Curdie, and\\r\\nshowed no dread of Lina.  Many were the significant nods exchanged, and\\r\\nmany a one said to another that the devil and the witch were old\\r\\nfriends.  But the woman was only a wise woman, who, having seen how\\r\\nCurdie and Lina behaved to each other, judged from that what sort they\\r\\nwere, and so made them welcome to her house. She was not like her\\r\\nfellow townspeople, for that they were strangers recommended them to\\r\\nher.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe moment her door was shut the other doors began to open, and soon\\r\\nthere appeared little groups here and there about a threshold, while a\\r\\nfew of the more courageous ventured out upon the square\\xe2\\x80\\x94all ready to\\r\\nmake for their houses again, however, upon the least sign of movement\\r\\nin the little thatched one.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe baker and the barber had joined one of these groups, and were\\r\\nbusily wagging their tongues against Curdie and his horrible beast.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'He can\\'t be honest,\\' said the barber; \\'for he paid me double the worth\\r\\nof the pane he broke in my window.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd then he told them how Curdie broke his window by breaking a stone\\r\\nin the street with his hammer.  There the baker struck in.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Now that was the stone,\\' said he, \\'over which I had fallen three times\\r\\nwithin the last month: could it be by fair means he broke that to\\r\\npieces at the first blow?  Just to make up my mind on that point I\\r\\ntried his own hammer against a stone in the gate; it nearly broke both\\r\\nmy arms, and loosened half the teeth in my head!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap15\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 15\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nDerba and Barbara\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMeantime the wanderers were hospitably entertained by the old woman and\\r\\nher grandchild and they were all very comfortable and happy together.\\r\\nLittle Barbara sat upon Curdie\\'s knee, and he told her stories about\\r\\nthe mines and his adventures in them.  But he never mentioned the king\\r\\nor the princess, for all that story was hard to believe.  And he told\\r\\nher about his mother and father, and how good they were.  And Derba sat\\r\\nand listened.  At last little Barbara fell asleep in Curdie\\'s arms, and\\r\\nher grandmother carried her to bed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was a poor little house, and Derba gave up her own room to Curdie\\r\\nbecause he was honest and talked wisely.  Curdie saw how it was, and\\r\\nbegged her to allow him to lie on the floor, but she would not hear of\\r\\nit.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the night he was waked by Lina pulling at him.  As soon as he spoke\\r\\nto her she ceased, and Curdie, listening, thought he heard someone\\r\\ntrying to get in.  He rose, took his mattock, and went about the house,\\r\\nlistening and watching; but although he heard noises now at one place\\r\\nnow at another, he could not think what they meant for no one appeared.\\r\\nCertainly, considering how she had frightened them all in the day, it\\r\\nwas not likely any one would attack Lina at night.  By and by the\\r\\nnoises ceased, and Curdie went back to his bed, and slept undisturbed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the morning, however, Derba came to him in great agitation, and said\\r\\nthey had fastened up the door, so that she could not get out. Curdie\\r\\nrose immediately and went with her: they found that not only the door,\\r\\nbut every window in the house was so secured on the outside that it was\\r\\nimpossible to open one of them without using great force.  Poor Derba\\r\\nlooked anxiously in Curdie\\'s face.  He broke out laughing.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'They are much mistaken,\\' he said, \\'if they fancy they could keep Lina\\r\\nand a miner in any house in Gwyntystorm\\xe2\\x80\\x94even if they built up doors\\r\\nand windows.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWith that he shouldered his mattock.  But Derba begged him not to make\\r\\na hole in her house just yet.  She had plenty for breakfast, she said,\\r\\nand before it was time for dinner they would know what the people meant\\r\\nby it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd indeed they did.  For within an hour appeared one of the chief\\r\\nmagistrates of the city, accompanied by a score of soldiers with drawn\\r\\nswords, and followed by a great multitude of people, requiring the\\r\\nminer and his brute to yield themselves, the one that he might be tried\\r\\nfor the disturbance he had occasioned and the injury he had committed,\\r\\nthe other that she might be roasted alive for her part in killing two\\r\\nvaluable and harmless animals belonging to worthy citizens.  The\\r\\nsummons was preceded and followed by flourish of trumpet, and was read\\r\\nwith every formality by the city marshal himself.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe moment he ended, Lina ran into the little passage, and stood\\r\\nopposite the door.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I surrender,\\' cried Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Then tie up your brute, and give her here.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'No, no,\\' cried Curdie through the door.  \\'I surrender; but I\\'m not\\r\\ngoing to do your hangman\\'s work.  If you want MY dog, you must take\\r\\nher.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Then we shall set the house on fire, and burn witch and all.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'It will go hard with us but we shall kill a few dozen of you first,\\'\\r\\ncried Curdie.  \\'We\\'re not the least afraid of you.\\'  With that Curdie\\r\\nturned to Derba, and said:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Don\\'t be frightened.  I have a strong feeling that all will be well.\\r\\nSurely no trouble will come to you for being good to strangers.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'But the poor dog!\\' said Derba.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow Curdie and Lina understood each other more than a little by this\\r\\ntime, and not only had he seen that she understood the proclamation,\\r\\nbut when she looked up at him after it was read, it was with such a\\r\\ngrin, and such a yellow flash, that he saw also she was determined to\\r\\ntake care of herself.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'The dog will probably give you reason to think a little more of her\\r\\nere long,\\' he answered.  \\'But now,\\' he went on, \\'I fear I must hurt\\r\\nyour house a little.  I have great confidence, however, that I shall be\\r\\nable to make up to you for it one day.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Never mind the house, if only you can get safe off,\\' she answered. \\'I\\r\\ndon\\'t think they will hurt this precious lamb,\\' she added, clasping\\r\\nlittle Barbara to her bosom.  \\'For myself, it is all one; I am ready\\r\\nfor anything.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'It is but a little hole for Lina I want to make,\\' said Curdie. \\'She\\r\\ncan creep through a much smaller one than you would think.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAgain he took his mattock, and went to the back wall.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'They won\\'t burn the house,\\' he said to himself.  \\'There is too good a\\r\\none on each side of it.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe tumult had kept increasing every moment, and the city marshal had\\r\\nbeen shouting, but Curdie had not listened to him.  When now they heard\\r\\nthe blows of his mattock, there went up a great cry, and the people\\r\\ntaunted the soldiers that they were afraid of a dog and his miner.  The\\r\\nsoldiers therefore made a rush at the door, and cut its fastenings.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe moment they opened it, out leaped Lina, with a roar so unnaturally\\r\\nhorrible that the sword arms of the soldiers dropped by their sides,\\r\\nparalysed with the terror of that cry; the crowd fled in every\\r\\ndirection, shrieking and yelling with mortal dismay; and without even\\r\\nknocking down with her tail, not to say biting a man of them with her\\r\\npulverizing jaws, Lina vanished\\xe2\\x80\\x94no one knew whither, for not one of\\r\\nthe crowd had had courage to look upon her.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe moment she was gone, Curdie advanced and gave himself up.  The\\r\\nsoldiers were so filled with fear, shame, and chagrin, that they were\\r\\nready to kill him on the spot.  But he stood quietly facing them, with\\r\\nhis mattock on his shoulder; and the magistrate wishing to examine him,\\r\\nand the people to see him made an example of, the soldiers had to\\r\\ncontent themselves with taking him.  Partly for derision, partly to\\r\\nhurt him, they laid his mattock against his back, and tied his arms to\\r\\nit.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey led him up a very steep street, and up another still, all the\\r\\ncrowd following.  The king\\'s palace-castle rose towering above them;\\r\\nbut they stopped before they reached it, at a low-browed door in a\\r\\ngreat, dull, heavy-looking building.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe city marshal opened it with a key which hung at his girdle, and\\r\\nordered Curdie to enter.  The place within was dark as night, and while\\r\\nhe was feeling his way with his feet, the marshal gave him a rough\\r\\npush.  He fell, and rolled once or twice over, unable to help himself\\r\\nbecause his hands were tied behind him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was the hour of the magistrate\\'s second and more important\\r\\nbreakfast, and until that was over he never found himself capable of\\r\\nattending to a case with concentration sufficient to the distinguishing\\r\\nof the side upon which his own advantage lay; and hence was this\\r\\nrespite for Curdie, with time to collect his thoughts.  But indeed he\\r\\nhad very few to collect, for all he had to do, so far as he could see,\\r\\nwas to wait for what would come next. Neither had he much power to\\r\\ncollect them, for he was a good deal shaken.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn a few minutes he discovered, to his great relief, that, from the\\r\\nprojection of the pick end of his mattock beyond his body, the fall had\\r\\nloosened the ropes tied round it.  He got one hand disengaged, and then\\r\\nthe other; and presently stood free, with his good mattock once more in\\r\\nright serviceable relation to his arms and legs.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap16\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 16\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nThe Mattock\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhile The magistrate reinvigorated his selfishness with a greedy\\r\\nbreakfast, Curdie found doing nothing in the dark rather tiresome work.\\r\\nIt was useless attempting to think what he should do next, seeing the\\r\\ncircumstances in which he was presently to find himself were altogether\\r\\nunknown to him.  So he began to think about his father and mother in\\r\\ntheir little cottage home, high in the clear air of the open\\r\\nMountainside, and the thought, instead of making his dungeon gloomier\\r\\nby the contrast, made a light in his soul that destroyed the power of\\r\\ndarkness and captivity.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut he was at length startled from his waking dream by a swell in the\\r\\nnoise outside.  All the time there had been a few of the more idle of\\r\\nthe inhabitants about the door, but they had been rather quiet.  Now,\\r\\nhowever, the sounds of feet and voices began to grow, and grew so\\r\\nrapidly that it was plain a multitude was gathering. For the people of\\r\\nGwyntystorm always gave themselves an hour of pleasure after their\\r\\nsecond breakfast, and what greater pleasure could they have than to see\\r\\na stranger abused by the officers of justice?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe noise grew till it was like the roaring of the sea, and that\\r\\nroaring went on a long time, for the magistrate, being a great man,\\r\\nliked to know that he was waited for: it added to the enjoyment of his\\r\\nbreakfast, and, indeed, enabled him to eat a little more after he had\\r\\nthought his powers exhausted.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut at length, in the waves of the human noises rose a bigger wave, and\\r\\nby the running and shouting and outcry, Curdie learned that the\\r\\nmagistrate was approaching.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPresently came the sound of the great rusty key in the lock, which\\r\\nyielded with groaning reluctance; the door was thrown back, the light\\r\\nrushed in, and with it came the voice of the city marshal, calling upon\\r\\nCurdie, by many legal epithets opprobrious, to come forth and be tried\\r\\nfor his life, inasmuch as he had raised a tumult in His Majesty\\'s city\\r\\nof Gwyntystorm, troubled the hearts of the king\\'s baker and barber, and\\r\\nslain the faithful dogs of His Majesty\\'s well-beloved butchers.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe was still reading, and Curdie was still seated in the brown twilight\\r\\nof the vault, not listening, but pondering with himself how this king\\r\\nthe city marshal talked of could be the same with the Majesty he had\\r\\nseen ride away on his grand white horse with the Princess Irene on a\\r\\ncushion before him, when a scream of agonized terror arose on the\\r\\nfarthest skirt of the crowd, and, swifter than flood or flame, the\\r\\nhorror spread shrieking.  In a moment the air was filled with hideous\\r\\nhowling, cries of unspeakable dismay, and the multitudinous noise of\\r\\nrunning feet.  The next moment, in at the door of the vault bounded\\r\\nLina, her two green eyes flaming yellow as sunflowers, and seeming to\\r\\nlight up the dungeon.  With one spring she threw herself at Curdie\\'s\\r\\nfeet, and laid her head upon them panting.  Then came a rush of two or\\r\\nthree soldiers darkening the doorway, but it was only to lay hold of\\r\\nthe key, pull the door to, and lock it; so that once more Curdie and\\r\\nLina were prisoners together.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor a few moments Lina lay panting hard: it is breathless work leaping\\r\\nand roaring both at once, and that in a way to scatter thousands of\\r\\npeople.  Then she jumped up, and began snuffing about all over the\\r\\nplace; and Curdie saw what he had never seen before\\xe2\\x80\\x94two faint spots of\\r\\nlight cast from her eyes upon the ground, one on each side of her\\r\\nsnuffing nose.  He got out his tinder box\\xe2\\x80\\x94a miner is never without\\r\\none\\xe2\\x80\\x94and lighted a precious bit of candle he carried in a division of\\r\\nit just for a moment, for he must not waste it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe light revealed a vault without any window or other opening than the\\r\\ndoor.  It was very old and much neglected.  The mortar had vanished\\r\\nfrom between the stones, and it was half filled with a heap of all\\r\\nsorts of rubbish, beaten down in the middle, but looser at the sides;\\r\\nit sloped from the door to the foot of the opposite wall: evidently for\\r\\na long time the vault had been left open, and every sort of refuse\\r\\nthrown into it.  A single minute served for the survey, so little was\\r\\nthere to note.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMeantime, down in the angle between the back wall and the base of the\\r\\nheap Lina was scratching furiously with all the eighteen great strong\\r\\nclaws of her mighty feet.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Ah, ha!\\' said Curdie to himself, catching sight of her, \\'if only they\\r\\nwill leave us long enough to ourselves!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWith that he ran to the door, to see if there was any fastening on the\\r\\ninside.  There was none: in all its long history it never had had one.\\r\\nBut a few blows of the right sort, now from the one, now from the other\\r\\nend of his mattock, were as good as any bolt, for they so ruined the\\r\\nlock that no key could ever turn in it again. Those who heard them\\r\\nfancied he was trying to get out, and laughed spitefully.  As soon as\\r\\nhe had done, he extinguished his candle, and went down to Lina.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe had reached the hard rock which formed the floor of the dungeon,\\r\\nand was now clearing away the earth a little wider. Presently she\\r\\nlooked up in his face and whined, as much as to say, \\'My paws are not\\r\\nhard enough to get any farther.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Then get out of my way, Lina,\\' said Curdie, and mind you keep your\\r\\neyes shining, for fear I should hit you.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo saying, he heaved his mattock, and assailed with the hammer end of\\r\\nit the spot she had cleared.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe rock was very hard, but when it did break it broke in good-sized\\r\\npieces.  Now with hammer, now with pick, he worked till he was weary,\\r\\nthen rested, and then set to again.  He could not tell how the day\\r\\nwent, as he had no light but the lamping of Lina\\'s eyes.  The darkness\\r\\nhampered him greatly, for he would not let Lina come close enough to\\r\\ngive him all the light she could, lest he should strike her.  So he\\r\\nhad, every now and then, to feel with his hands to know how he was\\r\\ngetting on, and to discover in what direction to strike: the exact spot\\r\\nwas a mere imagination.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe was getting very tired and hungry, and beginning to lose heart a\\r\\nlittle, when out of the ground, as if he had struck a spring of it,\\r\\nburst a dull, gleamy, lead-coloured light, and the next moment he heard\\r\\na hollow splash and echo.  A piece of rock had fallen out of the floor,\\r\\nand dropped into water beneath.  Already Lina, who had been lying a few\\r\\nyards off all the time he worked, was on her feet and peering through\\r\\nthe hole.  Curdie got down on his hands and knees, and looked.  They\\r\\nwere over what seemed a natural cave in the rock, to which apparently\\r\\nthe river had access, for, at a great distance below, a faint light was\\r\\ngleaming upon water.  If they could but reach it, they might get out;\\r\\nbut even if it was deep enough, the height was very dangerous.  The\\r\\nfirst thing, whatever might follow, was to make the hole larger.  It\\r\\nwas comparatively easy to break away the sides of it, and in the course\\r\\nof another hour he had it large enough to get through.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd now he must reconnoitre.  He took the rope they had tied him\\r\\nwith\\xe2\\x80\\x94for Curdie\\'s hindrances were always his furtherance\\xe2\\x80\\x94and fastened\\r\\none end of it by a slipknot round the handle of his pickaxes then\\r\\ndropped the other end through, and laid the pickaxe so that, when he\\r\\nwas through himself, and hanging on the edge, he could place it across\\r\\nthe hole to support him on the rope.  This done, he took the rope in\\r\\nhis hands, and, beginning to descend, found himself in a narrow cleft\\r\\nwidening into a cave.  His rope was not very long, and would not do\\r\\nmuch to lessen the force of his fall\\xe2\\x80\\x94he thought to himself\\xe2\\x80\\x94if he\\r\\nshould have to drop into the water; but he was not more than a couple\\r\\nof yards below the dungeon when he spied an opening on the opposite\\r\\nside of the cleft: it might be but a shadow hole, or it might lead them\\r\\nout.  He dropped himself a little below its level, gave the rope a\\r\\nswing by pushing his feet against the side of the cleft, and so\\r\\npenduled himself into it.  Then he laid a stone on the end of the rope\\r\\nthat it should not forsake him, called to Lina, whose yellow eyes were\\r\\ngleaming over the mattock grating above, to watch there till he\\r\\nreturned, and went cautiously in.  It proved a passage, level for some\\r\\ndistance, then sloping gently up.  He advanced carefully, feeling his\\r\\nway as he went.  At length he was stopped by a door\\xe2\\x80\\x94a small door,\\r\\nstudded with iron.  But the wood was in places so much decayed that\\r\\nsome of the bolts had dropped out, and he felt sure of being able to\\r\\nopen it.  He returned, therefore, to fetch Lina and his mattock.\\r\\nArrived at the cleft, his strong miner arms bore him swiftly up along\\r\\nthe rope and through the hole into the dungeon.  There he undid the\\r\\nrope from his mattock, and making Lina take the end of it in her teeth,\\r\\nand get through the hole, he lowered her\\xe2\\x80\\x94it was all he could do, she\\r\\nwas so heavy.  When she came opposite the passage, with a slight push\\r\\nof her tail she shot herself into it, and let go the rope, which Curdie\\r\\ndrew up.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen he lighted his candle and searching in the rubbish found a bit of\\r\\niron to take the place of his pickaxe across the hole.  Then he\\r\\nsearched again in the rubbish, and found half an old shutter.  This he\\r\\npropped up leaning a little over the hole, with a bit of stick, and\\r\\nheaped against the back of it a quantity of the loosened earth. Next he\\r\\ntied his mattock to the end of the rope, dropped it, and let it hang.\\r\\nLast, he got through the hole himself, and pulled away the propping\\r\\nstick, so that the shutter fell over the hole with a quantity of earth\\r\\non the top of it.  A few motions of hand over hand, and he swung\\r\\nhimself and his mattock into the passage beside Lina.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere he secured the end of the rope, and they went on together to the\\r\\ndoor.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap17\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 17\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nThe Wine Cellar\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe lighted his candle and examined it.  Decayed and broken as it was,\\r\\nit was strongly secured in its place by hinges on the one side, and\\r\\neither lock or bolt, he could not tell which, on the other.  A brief\\r\\nuse of his pocket-knife was enough to make room for his hand and arm to\\r\\nget through, and then he found a great iron bolt\\xe2\\x80\\x94but so rusty that he\\r\\ncould not move it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLina whimpered.  He took his knife again, made the hole bigger, and\\r\\nstood back.  In she shot her small head and long neck, seized the bolt\\r\\nwith her teeth, and dragged it, grating and complaining, back. A push\\r\\nthen opened the door.  It was at the foot of a short flight of steps.\\r\\nThey ascended, and at the top Curdie found himself in a space which,\\r\\nfrom the echo to his stamp, appeared of some size, though of what sort\\r\\nhe could not at first tell, for his hands, feeling about, came upon\\r\\nnothing.  Presently, however, they fell on a great thing: it was a wine\\r\\ncask.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe was just setting out to explore the place thoroughly, when he heard\\r\\nsteps coming down a stair.  He stood still, not knowing whether the\\r\\ndoor would open an inch from his nose or twenty yards behind his back.\\r\\nIt did neither.  He heard the key turn in the lock, and a stream of\\r\\nlight shot in, ruining the darkness, about fifteen yards away on his\\r\\nright.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA man carrying a candle in one hand and a large silver flagon in the\\r\\nother, entered, and came toward him.  The light revealed a row of huge\\r\\nwine casks, that stretched away into the darkness of the other end of\\r\\nthe long vault.  Curdie retreated into the recess of the stair, and\\r\\npeeping round the corner of it, watched him, thinking what he could do\\r\\nto prevent him from locking them in.  He came on and on, until curdie\\r\\nfeared he would pass the recess and see them.  He was just preparing to\\r\\nrush out, and master him before he should give alarm, not in the least\\r\\nknowing what he should do next, when, to his relief, the man stopped at\\r\\nthe third cask from where he stood.  He set down his light on the top\\r\\nof it, removed what seemed a large vent-peg, and poured into the cask a\\r\\nquantity of something from the flagon.  Then he turned to the next\\r\\ncask, drew some wine, rinsed the flagon, threw the wine away, drew and\\r\\nrinsed and threw away again, then drew and drank, draining to the\\r\\nbottom.  Last of all, he filled the flagon from the cask he had first\\r\\nvisited, replaced then the vent-peg, took up his candle, and turned\\r\\ntoward the door.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'There is something wrong here!\\' thought Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Speak to him, Lina,\\' he whispered.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe sudden howl she gave made Curdie himself start and tremble for a\\r\\nmoment.  As to the man, he answered Lina\\'s with another horrible howl,\\r\\nforced from him by the convulsive shudder of every muscle of his body,\\r\\nthen reeled gasping to and fro, and dropped his candle. But just as\\r\\nCurdie expected to see him fall dead he recovered himself, and flew to\\r\\nthe door, through which he darted, leaving it open behind him.  The\\r\\nmoment he ran, Curdie stepped out, picked up the candle still alight,\\r\\nsped after him to the door, drew out the key, and then returned to the\\r\\nstair and waited.  In a few minutes he heard the sound of many feet and\\r\\nvoices.  Instantly he turned the tap of the cask from which the man had\\r\\nbeen drinking, set the candle beside it on the floor, went down the\\r\\nsteps and out of the little door, followed by Lina, and closed it\\r\\nbehind them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThrough the hole in it he could see a little, and hear all.  He could\\r\\nsee how the light of many candles filled the place, and could hear how\\r\\nsome two dozen feet ran hither and thither through the echoing cellar;\\r\\nhe could hear the clash of iron, probably spits and pokers, now and\\r\\nthen; and at last heard how, finding nothing remarkable except the best\\r\\nwine running to waste, they all turned on the butler and accused him of\\r\\nhaving fooled them with a drunken dream.  He did his best to defend\\r\\nhimself, appealing to the evidence of their own senses that he was as\\r\\nsober as they were. They replied that a fright was no less a fright\\r\\nthat the cause was imaginary, and a dream no less a dream that the\\r\\nfright had waked him from it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen he discovered, and triumphantly adduced as corroboration, that the\\r\\nkey was gone from the door, they said it merely showed how drunk he had\\r\\nbeen\\xe2\\x80\\x94either that or how frightened, for he had certainly dropped it.\\r\\nIn vain he protested that he had never taken it out of the lock\\xe2\\x80\\x94that\\r\\nhe never did when he went in, and certainly had not this time stopped\\r\\nto do so when he came out; they asked him why he had to go to the\\r\\ncellar at such a time of the day, and said it was because he had\\r\\nalready drunk all the wine that was left from dinner.  He said if he\\r\\nhad dropped the key, the key was to be found, and they must help him to\\r\\nfind it.  They told him they wouldn\\'t move a peg for him.  He declared,\\r\\nwith much language, he would have them all turned out of the king\\'s\\r\\nservice.  They said they would swear he was drunk.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd so positive were they about it, that at last the butler himself\\r\\nbegan to think whether it was possible they could be in the right. For\\r\\nhe knew that sometimes when he had been drunk he fancied things had\\r\\ntaken place which he found afterward could not have happened. Certain\\r\\nof his fellow servants, however, had all the time a doubt whether the\\r\\ncellar goblin had not appeared to him, or at least roared at him, to\\r\\nprotect the wine.  In any case nobody wanted to find the key for him;\\r\\nnothing could please them better than that the door of the wine cellar\\r\\nshould never more be locked.  By degrees the hubbub died away, and they\\r\\ndeparted, not even pulling to the door, for there was neither handle\\r\\nnor latch to it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs soon as they were gone, Curdie returned, knowing now that they were\\r\\nin the wine cellar of the palace, as indeed, he had suspected. Finding\\r\\na pool of wine in a hollow of the floor, Lina lapped it up eagerly: she\\r\\nhad had no breakfast, and was now very thirsty as well as hungry.  Her\\r\\nmaster was in a similar plight, for he had but just begun to eat when\\r\\nthe magistrate arrived with the soldiers.  If only they were all in\\r\\nbed, he thought, that he might find his way to the larder!  For he said\\r\\nto himself that, as he was sent there by the young princess\\'s\\r\\ngreat-great-grandmother to serve her or her father in some way, surely\\r\\nhe must have a right to his food in the Palace, without which he could\\r\\ndo nothing.  He would go at once and reconnoitre.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo he crept up the stair that led from the cellar.  At the top was a\\r\\ndoor, opening on a long passage dimly lighted by a lamp.  He told Lina\\r\\nto lie down upon the stair while he went on.  At the end of the passage\\r\\nhe found a door ajar, and, peering through, saw right into a great\\r\\nstone hall, where a huge fire was blazing, and through which men in the\\r\\nking\\'s livery were constantly coming and going. Some also in the same\\r\\nlivery were lounging about the fire.  He noted that their colours were\\r\\nthe same as those he himself, as king\\'s miner, wore; but from what he\\r\\nhad seen and heard of the habits of the place, he could not hope they\\r\\nwould treat him the better for that.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe one interesting thing at the moment, however, was the plentiful\\r\\nsupper with which the table was spread.  It was something at least to\\r\\nstand in sight of food, and he was unwilling to turn his back on the\\r\\nprospect so long as a share in it was not absolutely hopeless. Peeping\\r\\nthus, he soon made UP his mind that if at any moment the hall should be\\r\\nempty, he would at that moment rush in and attempt to carry off a dish.\\r\\nThat he might lose no time by indecision, he selected a large pie upon\\r\\nwhich to pounce instantaneously.  But after he had watched for some\\r\\nminutes, it did not seem at all likely the chance would arrive before\\r\\nsuppertime, and he was just about to turn away and rejoin Lina, when he\\r\\nsaw that there was not a person in the place.  Curdie never made up his\\r\\nmind and then hesitated.  He darted in, seized the pie, and bore it\\r\\nswiftly and noiselessly to the cellar stair.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap18\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 18\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nThe King\\'s Kitchen\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBack to the cellar Curdie and Lina sped with their booty, where, seated\\r\\non the steps, Curdie lighted his bit of candle for a moment. A very\\r\\nlittle bit it was now, but they did not waste much of it in examination\\r\\nof the pie; that they effected by a more summary process.  Curdie\\r\\nthought it the nicest food he had ever tasted, and between them they\\r\\nsoon ate it up.  Then Curdie would have thrown the dish along with the\\r\\nbones into the water, that there might be no traces of them; but he\\r\\nthought of his mother, and hid it instead; and the very next minute\\r\\nthey wanted it to draw some wine into.  He was careful it should be\\r\\nfrom the cask of which he had seen the butler drink.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen they sat down again upon the steps, and waited until the house\\r\\nshould be quiet.  For he was there to do something, and if it did not\\r\\ncome to him in the cellar, he must go to meet it in other places.\\r\\nTherefore, lest he should fall asleep, he set the end of the helve of\\r\\nhis mattock on the ground, and seated himself on the cross part,\\r\\nleaning against the wall, so that as long as he kept awake he should\\r\\nrest, but the moment he began to fall asleep he must fall awake\\r\\ninstead.  He quite expected some of the servants would visit the cellar\\r\\nagain that night, but whether it was that they were afraid of each\\r\\nother, or believed more of the butler\\'s story than they had chosen to\\r\\nallow, not one of them appeared.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen at length he thought he might venture, he shouldered his mattock\\r\\nand crept up the stair.  The lamp was out in the passage, but he could\\r\\nnot miss his way to the servants\\' hall.  Trusting to Lina\\'s quickness\\r\\nin concealing herself, he took her with him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen they reached the hall they found it quiet and nearly dark. The\\r\\nlast of the great fire was glowing red, but giving little light.\\r\\nCurdie stood and warmed himself for a few moments: miner as he was, he\\r\\nhad found the cellar cold to sit in doing nothing; and standing thus he\\r\\nthought of looking if there were any bits of candle about.  There were\\r\\nmany candlesticks on the supper table, but to his disappointment and\\r\\nindignation their candles seemed to have been all left to burn out, and\\r\\nsome of them, indeed, he found still hot in the neck.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPresently, one after another, he came upon seven men fast asleep, most\\r\\nof them upon tables, one in a chair, and one on the floor. They seemed,\\r\\nfrom their shape and colour, to have eaten and drunk so much that they\\r\\nmight be burned alive without wakening.  He grasped the hand of each in\\r\\nsuccession, and found two ox hoofs, three pig hoofs, one concerning\\r\\nwhich he could not be sure whether it was the hoof of a donkey or a\\r\\npony, and one dog\\'s paw.  \\'A nice set of people to be about a king!\\'\\r\\nthought Curdie to himself, and turned again to his candle hunt.  He did\\r\\nat last find two or three little pieces, and stowed them away in his\\r\\npockets.  They now left the hall by another door, and entered a short\\r\\npassage, which led them to the huge kitchen, vaulted and black with\\r\\nsmoke.  There, too, the fire was still burning, so that he was able to\\r\\nsee a little of the state of things in this quarter also.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe place was dirty and disorderly.  In a recess, on a heap of\\r\\nbrushwood, lay a kitchen-maid, with a table cover around her, and a\\r\\nskillet in her hand: evidently she too had been drinking.  In another\\r\\ncorner lay a page, and Curdie noted how like his dress was to his own.\\r\\nIn the cinders before the hearth were huddled three dogs and five cats,\\r\\nall fast asleep, while the rats were running about the floor.  Curdie\\'s\\r\\nheart ached to think of the lovely child-princess living over such a\\r\\nsty.  The mine was a paradise to a palace with such servants in it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLeaving the kitchen, he got into the region of the sculleries. There\\r\\nhorrible smells were wandering about, like evil spirits that come forth\\r\\nwith the darkness.  He lighted a candle\\xe2\\x80\\x94but only to see ugly sights.\\r\\nEverywhere was filth and disorder.  Mangy turnspit dogs were lying\\r\\nabout, and grey rats were gnawing at refuse in the sinks.  It was like\\r\\na hideous dream.  He felt as if he should never get out of it, and\\r\\nlonged for one glimpse of his mother\\'s poor little kitchen, so clean\\r\\nand bright and airy. Turning from it at last in miserable disgust, he\\r\\nalmost ran back through the kitchen, re-entered the hall, and crossed\\r\\nit to another door.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt opened upon a wider passage leading to an arch in a stately\\r\\ncorridor, all its length lighted by lamps in niches.  At the end of it\\r\\nwas a large and beautiful hall, with great pillars.  There sat three\\r\\nmen in the royal livery, fast asleep, each in a great armchair, with\\r\\nhis feet on a huge footstool.  They looked like fools dreaming\\r\\nthemselves kings; and Lina looked as if she longed to throttle them.\\r\\nAt one side of the hall was the grand staircase, and they went up.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEverything that now met Curdie\\'s eyes was rich\\xe2\\x80\\x94not glorious like the\\r\\nsplendours of the mountain cavern, but rich and soft\\xe2\\x80\\x94except where, now\\r\\nand then, some rough old rib of the ancient fortress came through, hard\\r\\nand discoloured.  Now some dark bare arch of stone, now some rugged and\\r\\nblackened pillar, now some huge beam, brown with the smoke and dust of\\r\\ncenturies, looked like a thistle in the midst of daisies, or a rock in\\r\\na smooth lawn.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey wandered about a good while, again and again finding themselves\\r\\nwhere they had been before.  Gradually, however, Curdie was gaining\\r\\nsome idea of the place.  By and by Lina began to look frightened, and\\r\\nas they went on Curdie saw that she looked more and more frightened.\\r\\nNow, by this time he had come to understand that what made her look\\r\\nfrightened was always the fear of frightening, and he therefore\\r\\nconcluded they must be drawing nigh to somebody.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt last, in a gorgeously painted gallery, he saw a curtain of crimson,\\r\\nand on the curtain a royal crown wrought in silks and stones.  He felt\\r\\nsure this must be the king\\'s chamber, and it was here he was wanted;\\r\\nor, if it was not the place he was bound for, something would meet him\\r\\nand turn him aside; for he had come to think that so long as a man\\r\\nwants to do right he may go where he can: when he can go no farther,\\r\\nthen it is not the way.  \\'Only,\\' said his father, in assenting to the\\r\\ntheory, \\'he must really want to do right, and not merely fancy he does.\\r\\nHe must want it with his heart and will, and not with his rag of a\\r\\ntongue.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo he gently lifted the corner of the curtain, and there behind it was\\r\\na half-open door.  He entered, and the moment he was in, Lina stretched\\r\\nherself along the threshold between the curtain and the door.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap19\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 19\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nThe King\\'s Chamber\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe found himself in a large room, dimly lighted by a silver lamp that\\r\\nhung from the ceiling.  Far at the other end was a great bed,\\r\\nsurrounded with dark heavy curtains.  He went softly toward it, his\\r\\nheart beating fast.  It was a dreadful thing to be alone in the king\\'s\\r\\nchamber at the dead of night.  To gain courage he had to remind himself\\r\\nof the beautiful princess who had sent him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut when he was about halfway to the bed, a figure appeared from the\\r\\nfarther side of it, and came towards him, with a hand raised warningly.\\r\\nHe stood still.  The light was dim, and he could distinguish little\\r\\nmore than the outline of a young girl.  But though the form he saw was\\r\\nmuch taller than the princess he remembered, he never doubted it was\\r\\nshe.  For one thing, he knew that most girls would have been frightened\\r\\nto see him there in the dead of the night, but like a true princess,\\r\\nand the princess he used to know, she walked straight on to meet him.\\r\\nAs she came she lowered the hand she had lifted, and laid the\\r\\nforefinger of it upon her lips.  Nearer and nearer, quite near, close\\r\\nup to him she came, then stopped, and stood a moment looking at him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'You are Curdie,\\' she said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'And you are the Princess Irene,\\' he returned.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Then we know each other still,\\' she said, with a sad smile of\\r\\npleasure.  \\'You will help me.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'That I will,\\' answered Curdie.  He did not say, \\'If I can\\'; for he\\r\\nknew that what he was sent to do, that he could do.  \\'May I kiss your\\r\\nhand, little Princess?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe was only between nine and ten, though indeed she looked several\\r\\nyears older, and her eyes almost those of a grown woman, for she had\\r\\nhad terrible trouble of late.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe held out her hand.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I am not the little princess any more.  I have grown up since I saw\\r\\nyou last, Mr Miner.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe smile which accompanied the words had in it a strange mixture of\\r\\nplayfulness and sadness.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'So I see, Miss Princess,\\' returned Curdie; \\'and therefore, being more\\r\\nof a princess, you are the more my princess.  Here I am, sent by your\\r\\ngreat-great-grandmother, to be your servant.  May I ask why you are up\\r\\nso late, Princess?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Because my father wakes so frightened, and I don\\'t know what he would\\r\\ndo if he didn\\'t find me by his bedside.  There! he\\'s waking now.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe darted off to the side of the bed she had come from.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie stood where he was.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA voice altogether unlike what he remembered of the mighty, noble king\\r\\non his white horse came from the bed, thin, feeble, hollow, and husky,\\r\\nand in tone like that of a petulant child:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I will not, I will not.  I am a king, and I will be a king.  I hate\\r\\nyou and despise you, and you shall not torture me!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Never mind them, Father dear,\\' said the princess.  \\'I am here, and\\r\\nthey shan\\'t touch you.  They dare not, you know, so long as you defy\\r\\nthem.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'They want my crown, darling; and I can\\'t give them my crown, can I?\\r\\nFor what is a king without his crown?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'They shall never have your crown, my king,\\' said Irene.  \\'Here it\\r\\nis\\xe2\\x80\\x94all safe.  I am watching it for you.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie drew near the bed on the other side.  There lay the grand old\\r\\nking\\xe2\\x80\\x94he looked grand still, and twenty years older.  His body was\\r\\npillowed high; his beard descended long and white over the crimson\\r\\ncoverlid; and his crown, its diamonds and emeralds gleaming in the\\r\\ntwilight of the curtains, lay in front of him, his long thin old hands\\r\\nfolded round it, and the ends of his beard straying among the lovely\\r\\nstones.  His face was like that of a man who had died fighting nobly;\\r\\nbut one thing made it dreadful: his eyes, while they moved about as if\\r\\nsearching in this direction and in that, looked more dead than his\\r\\nface.  He saw neither his daughter nor his crown: it was the voice of\\r\\nthe one and the touch of the other that comforted him.  He kept\\r\\nmurmuring what seemed words, but was unintelligible to Curdie,\\r\\nalthough, to judge from the look of Irene\\'s face, she learned and\\r\\nconcluded from it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy degrees his voice sank away and the murmuring ceased, although still\\r\\nhis lips moved.  Thus lay the old king on his bed, slumbering with his\\r\\ncrown between his hands; on one side of him stood a lovely little\\r\\nmaiden, with blue eyes, and brown hair going a little back from her\\r\\ntemples, as if blown by a wind that no one felt but herself; and on the\\r\\nother a stalwart young miner, with his mattock over his shoulder.\\r\\nStranger sight still was Lina lying along the threshold\\xe2\\x80\\x94only nobody\\r\\nsaw her just then.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA moment more and the king\\'s lips ceased to move.  His breathing had\\r\\ngrown regular and quiet.  The princess gave a sigh of relief, and came\\r\\nround to Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'We can talk a little now,\\' she said, leading him toward the middle of\\r\\nthe room.  \\'My father will sleep now till the doctor wakes him to give\\r\\nhim his medicine.  It is not really medicine, though, but wine.\\r\\nNothing but that, the doctor says, could have kept him so long alive.\\r\\nHe always comes in the middle of the night to give it him with his own\\r\\nhands.  But it makes me cry to see him wake up when so nicely asleep.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'What sort of man is your doctor?\\' asked Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Oh, such a dear, good, kind gentleman!\\' replied the princess.  \\'He\\r\\nspeaks so softly, and is so sorry for his dear king!  He will be here\\r\\npresently, and you shall see for yourself.  You will like him very\\r\\nmuch.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Has your king-father been long ill?\\' asked Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'A whole year now,\\' she replied.  \\'Did you not know?  That\\'s how your\\r\\nmother never got the red petticoat my father promised her. The lord\\r\\nchancellor told me that not only Gwyntystorm but the whole land was\\r\\nmourning over the illness of the good man.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow Curdie himself had not heard a word of His Majesty\\'s illness, and\\r\\nhad no ground for believing that a single soul in any place he had\\r\\nvisited on his journey had heard of it.  Moreover, although mention had\\r\\nbeen made of His Majesty again and again in his hearing since he came\\r\\nto Gwyntystorm, never once had he heard an allusion to the state of his\\r\\nhealth.  And now it dawned upon him also that he had never heard the\\r\\nleast expression of love to him.  But just for the time he thought it\\r\\nbetter to say nothing on either point.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Does the king wander like this every night?\\' he asked.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Every night,\\' answered Irene, shaking her head mournfully.  \\'That is\\r\\nwhy I never go to bed at night.  He is better during the day\\xe2\\x80\\x94a little,\\r\\nand then I sleep\\xe2\\x80\\x94in the dressing room there, to be with him in a\\r\\nmoment if he should call me.  It is so sad he should have only me and\\r\\nnot my mamma!  A princess is nothing to a queen!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I wish he would like me,\\' said Curdie, \\'for then I might watch by him\\r\\nat night, and let you go to bed, Princess.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Don\\'t you know then?\\' returned Irene, in wonder.  \\'How was it you\\r\\ncame?  Ah!  You said my grandmother sent you.  But I thought you knew\\r\\nthat he wanted you.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd again she opened wide her blue stars.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Not I,\\' said Curdie, also bewildered, but very glad.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'He used to be constantly saying\\xe2\\x80\\x94he was not so ill then as he is\\r\\nnow\\xe2\\x80\\x94that he wished he had you about him.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'And I never to know it!\\' said Curdie, with displeasure.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'The master of the horse told papa\\'s own secretary that he had written\\r\\nto the miner-general to find you and send you up; but the miner-general\\r\\nwrote back to the master of the horse, and he told the secretary, and\\r\\nthe secretary told my father, that they had searched every mine in the\\r\\nkingdom and could hear nothing of you. My father gave a great sigh, and\\r\\nsaid he feared the goblins had got you, after all, and your father and\\r\\nmother were dead of grief.  And he has never mentioned you since,\\r\\nexcept when wandering.  I cried very much.  But one of my grandmother\\'s\\r\\npigeons with its white wing flashed a message to me through the window\\r\\none day, and then I knew that my Curdie wasn\\'t eaten by the goblins,\\r\\nfor my grandmother wouldn\\'t have taken care of him one time to let him\\r\\nbe eaten the next.  Where were you, Curdie, that they couldn\\'t find\\r\\nyou?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'We will talk about that another time, when we are not expecting the\\r\\ndoctor,\\' said Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs he spoke, his eyes fell upon something shining on the table under\\r\\nthe lamp.  His heart gave a great throb, and he went nearer. Yes, there\\r\\ncould be no doubt\\xe2\\x80\\x94it was the same flagon that the butler had filled in\\r\\nthe wine cellar.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'It looks worse and worse!\\'he said to himself, and went back to Irene,\\r\\nwhere she stood half dreaming.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'When will the doctor be here?\\' he asked once more\\xe2\\x80\\x94this time hurriedly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe question was answered\\xe2\\x80\\x94not by the princess, but by something which\\r\\nthat instant tumbled heavily into the room.  Curdie flew toward it in\\r\\nvague terror about Lina.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOn the floor lay a little round man, puffing and blowing, and uttering\\r\\nincoherent language.  Curdie thought of his mattock, and ran and laid\\r\\nit aside.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Oh, dear Dr Kelman!\\' cried the princess, running up and taking hold of\\r\\nhis arm; \\'I am so sorry!\\'  She pulled and pulled, but might almost as\\r\\nwell have tried to set up a cannon ball.  \\'I hope you have not hurt\\r\\nyourself?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Not at all, not at all,\\' said the doctor, trying to smile and to rise\\r\\nboth at once, but finding it impossible to do either.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'If he slept on the floor he would be late for breakfast,\\' said Curdie\\r\\nto himself, and held out his hand to help him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut when he took hold of it, Curdie very nearly let him fall again, for\\r\\nwhat he held was not even a foot: it was the belly of a creeping thing.\\r\\nHe managed, however, to hold both his peace and his grasp, and pulled\\r\\nthe doctor roughly on his legs\\xe2\\x80\\x94such as they were.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Your Royal Highness has rather a thick mat at the door,\\' said the\\r\\ndoctor, patting his palms together.  \\'I hope my awkwardness may not\\r\\nhave startled His Majesty.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhile he talked Curdie went to the door: Lina was not there.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe doctor approached the bed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'And how has my beloved king slept tonight?\\' he asked.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'No better,\\' answered Irene, with a mournful shake of her head.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Ah, that is very well!\\' returned the doctor, his fall seeming to have\\r\\nmuddled either his words or his meaning.  \\'When we give him his wine,\\r\\nhe will be better still.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie darted at the flagon, and lifted it high, as if he had expected\\r\\nto find it full, but had found it empty.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'That stupid butler!  I heard them say he was drunk!\\' he cried in a\\r\\nloud whisper, and was gliding from the room.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Come here with that flagon, you!  Page!\\' cried the doctor. Curdie came\\r\\na few steps toward him with the flagon dangling from his hand, heedless\\r\\nof the gushes that fell noiseless on the thick carpet.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Are you aware, young man,\\' said the doctor, \\'that it is not every wine\\r\\ncan do His Majesty the benefit I intend he should derive from my\\r\\nprescription?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Quite aware, sir, answered Curdie.  \\'The wine for His Majesty\\'s use is\\r\\nin the third cask from the corner.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Fly, then,\\' said the doctor, looking satisfied.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie stopped outside the curtain and blew an audible breath\\xe2\\x80\\x94no more;\\r\\nup came Lina noiseless as a shadow.  He showed her the flagon.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'The cellar, Lina: go,\\' he said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe galloped away on her soft feet, and Curdie had indeed to fly to\\r\\nkeep up with her.  Not once did she make even a dubious turn.  From the\\r\\nking\\'s gorgeous chamber to the cold cellar they shot.  Curdie dashed\\r\\nthe wine down the back stair, rinsed the flagon out as he had seen the\\r\\nbutler do, filled it from the cask of which he had seen the butler\\r\\ndrink, and hastened with it up again to the king\\'s room.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe little doctor took it, poured out a full glass, smelt, but did not\\r\\ntaste it, and set it down.  Then he leaned over the bed, shouted in the\\r\\nking\\'s ear, blew upon his eyes, and pinched his arm: Curdie thought he\\r\\nsaw him run something bright into it.  At last the king half woke.  The\\r\\ndoctor seized the glass, raised his head, poured the wine down his\\r\\nthroat, and let his head fall back on the pillow again.  Tenderly\\r\\nwiping his beard, and bidding the princess good night in paternal\\r\\ntones, he then took his leave.  Curdie would gladly have driven his\\r\\npick into his head, but that was not in his commission, and he let him\\r\\ngo.  The little round man looked very carefully to his feet as he\\r\\ncrossed the threshold.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'That attentive fellow of a page has removed the mat,\\' he said to\\r\\nhimself, as he walked along the corridor.  \\'I must remember him.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap20\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 20\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCounterplotting\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie was already sufficiently enlightened as to how things were\\r\\ngoing, to see that he must have the princess of one mind with him, and\\r\\nthey must work together.  It was clear that among those about the king\\r\\nthere was a plot against him: for one thing, they had agreed in a lie\\r\\nconcerning himself; and it was plain also that the doctor was working\\r\\nout a design against the health and reason of His Majesty, rendering\\r\\nthe question of his life a matter of little moment.  It was in itself\\r\\nsufficient to justify the worst fears, that the people outside the\\r\\npalace were ignorant of His Majesty\\'s condition: he believed those\\r\\ninside it also\\xe2\\x80\\x94the butler excepted\\xe2\\x80\\x94were ignorant of it as well.\\r\\nDoubtless His Majesty\\'s councillors desired to alienate the hearts of\\r\\nhis subjects from their sovereign.  Curdie\\'s idea was that they\\r\\nintended to kill the king, marry the princess to one of themselves, and\\r\\nfound a new dynasty; but whatever their purpose, there was treason in\\r\\nthe palace of the worst sort: they were making and keeping the king\\r\\nincapable, in order to effect that purpose.  The first thing to be seen\\r\\nto, therefore, was that His Majesty should neither eat morsel nor drink\\r\\ndrop of anything prepared for him in the palace.  Could this have been\\r\\nmanaged without the princess, Curdie would have preferred leaving her\\r\\nin ignorance of the horrors from which he sought to deliver her.  He\\r\\nfeared also the danger of her knowledge betraying itself to the evil\\r\\neyes about her; but it must be risked and she had always been a wise\\r\\nchild.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnother thing was clear to him\\xe2\\x80\\x94that with such traitors no terms of\\r\\nhonour were either binding or possible, and that, short of lying, he\\r\\nmight use any means to foil them.  And he could not doubt that the old\\r\\nprincess had sent him expressly to frustrate their plans.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhile he stood thinking thus with himself, the princess was earnestly\\r\\nwatching the king, with looks of childish love and womanly tenderness\\r\\nthat went to Curdie\\'s heart.  Now and then with a great fan of peacock\\r\\nfeathers she would fan him very softly; now and then, seeing a cloud\\r\\nbegin to gather upon the sky of his sleeping face, she would climb upon\\r\\nthe bed, and bending to his ear whisper into it, then draw back and\\r\\nwatch again\\xe2\\x80\\x94generally to see the cloud disperse.  In his deepest\\r\\nslumber, the soul of the king lay open to the voice of his child, and\\r\\nthat voice had power either to change the aspect of his visions, or,\\r\\nwhich was better still, to breathe hope into his heart, and courage to\\r\\nendure them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie came near, and softly called her.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I can\\'t leave Papa just yet,\\' she returned, in a low voice.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I will wait,\\' said Curdie; \\'but I want very much to say something.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn a few minutes she came to him where he stood under the lamp.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Well, Curdie, what is it?\\' she said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Princess,\\' he replied, \\'I want to tell you that I have found why your\\r\\ngrandmother sent me.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Come this way, then, she answered, \\'where I can see the face of my\\r\\nking.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie placed a chair for her in the spot she chose, where she would be\\r\\nnear enough to mark any slightest change on her father\\'s countenance,\\r\\nyet where their low-voiced talk would not disturb him. There he sat\\r\\ndown beside her and told her all the story\\xe2\\x80\\x94how her grandmother had\\r\\nsent her good pigeon for him, and how she had instructed him, and sent\\r\\nhim there without telling him what he had to do.  Then he told her what\\r\\nhe had discovered of the state of things generally in Gwyntystorm, and\\r\\nespecially what he had heard and seen in the palace that night.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Things are in a bad state enough,\\' he said in conclusion\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\'lying and\\r\\nselfishness and inhospitality and dishonesty everywhere; and to crown\\r\\nall, they speak with disrespect of the good king, and not a man knows\\r\\nhe is ill.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'You frighten me dreadfully,\\' said Irene, trembling.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'You must be brave for your king\\'s sake,\\' said Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Indeed I will,\\' she replied, and turned a long loving look upon the\\r\\nbeautiful face of her father.  \\'But what is to be done?  And how am I\\r\\nto believe such horrible things of Dr Kelman?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'My dear Princess,\\' replied Curdie, \\'you know nothing of him but his\\r\\nface and his tongue, and they are both false.  Either you must beware\\r\\nof him, or you must doubt your grandmother and me; for I tell you, by\\r\\nthe gift she gave me of testing hands, that this man is a snake.  That\\r\\nround body he shows is but the case of a serpent. Perhaps the creature\\r\\nlies there, as in its nest, coiled round and round inside.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Horrible!\\' said Irene.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Horrible indeed; but we must not try to get rid of horrible things by\\r\\nrefusing to look at them, and saying they are not there.  Is not your\\r\\nbeautiful father sleeping better since he had the wine?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Yes.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Does he always sleep better after having it?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe reflected an instant.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'No; always worse\\xe2\\x80\\x94till tonight,\\' she answered.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Then remember that was the wine I got him\\xe2\\x80\\x94not what the butler drew.\\r\\nNothing that passes through any hand in the house except yours or mine\\r\\nmust henceforth, till he is well, reach His Majesty\\'s lips.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'But how, dear Curdie?\\' said the princess, almost crying.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'That we must contrive,\\' answered Curdie.  \\'I know how to take care of\\r\\nthe wine; but for his food\\xe2\\x80\\x94now we must think.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'He takes hardly any,\\' said the princess, with a pathetic shake of her\\r\\nlittle head which Curdie had almost learned to look for.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'The more need,\\' he replied, \\'there should be no poison in it.\\' Irene\\r\\nshuddered.  \\'As soon as he has honest food he will begin to grow\\r\\nbetter.  And you must be just as careful with yourself, Princess,\\'\\r\\nCurdie went on, \\'for you don\\'t know when they may begin to poison you,\\r\\ntoo.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'There\\'s no fear of me; don\\'t talk about me,\\' said Irene.  \\'The good\\r\\nfood!  How are we to get it, Curdie?  That is the whole question.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I am thinking hard,\\' answered Curdie.  \\'The good food?  Let me\\r\\nsee\\xe2\\x80\\x94let me see!  Such servants as I saw below are sure to have the\\r\\nbest of everything for themselves: I will go an see what I can find on\\r\\ntheir table.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'The chancellor sleeps in the house, and he and the master of the\\r\\nking\\'s horse always have their supper together in a room off the great\\r\\nhall, to the right as you go down the stairs,\\' said Irene. \\'I would go\\r\\nwith you, but I dare not leave my father.  Alas!  He scarcely ever\\r\\ntakes more than a mouthful.  I can\\'t think how he lives!  And the very\\r\\nthing he would like, and often asks for\\xe2\\x80\\x94a bit of bread\\xe2\\x80\\x94I can hardly\\r\\never get for him: Dr Kelman has forbidden it, and says it is nothing\\r\\nless than poison to him.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Bread at least he shall have,\\' said Curdie; \\'and that, with the honest\\r\\nwine, will do as well as anything, I do believe.  I will go at once and\\r\\nlook for some.  But I want you to see Lina first, and know her, lest,\\r\\ncoming upon her by accident at any time, you should be frightened.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I should like much to see her,\\' said the princess.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWarning her not to be startled by her ugliness, he went to the door and\\r\\ncalled her.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe entered, creeping with downcast head, and dragging her tail over\\r\\nthe floor behind her.  Curdie watched the princess as the frightful\\r\\ncreature came nearer and nearer.  One shudder went from head to foot,\\r\\nand next instant she stepped to meet her.  Lina dropped flat on the\\r\\nfloor, and covered her face with her two big paws.  It went to the\\r\\nheart of the princess: in a moment she was on her knees beside her,\\r\\nstroking her ugly head, and patting her all over.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Good dog!  Dear ugly dog!\\' she said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLina whimpered.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I believe,\\' said Curdie, \\'from what your grandmother told me, that\\r\\nLina is a woman, and that she was naughty, but is now growing good.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLina had lifted her head while Irene was caressing her; now she dropped\\r\\nit again between her paws; but the princess took it in her hands, and\\r\\nkissed the forehead betwixt the gold-green eyes.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Shall I take her with me or leave her?\\' asked Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Leave her, poor dear,\\' said Irene, and Curdie, knowing the way now,\\r\\nwent without her.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe took his way first to the room the princess had spoken of, and there\\r\\nalso were the remains of supper; but neither there nor in the kitchen\\r\\ncould he find a scrap of plain wholesome-looking bread.  So he returned\\r\\nand told her that as soon as it was light he would go into the city for\\r\\nsome, and asked her for a handkerchief to tie it in.  If he could not\\r\\nbring it himself, he would send it by Lina, who could keep out of sight\\r\\nbetter than he, and as soon as all was quiet at night he would come to\\r\\nher again.  He also asked her to tell the king that he was in the\\r\\nhouse.  His hope lay in the fact that bakers everywhere go to work\\r\\nearly.  But it was yet much too early.  So he persuaded the princess to\\r\\nlie down, promising to call her if the king should stir.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap21\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 21\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nThe Loaf\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHis Majesty slept very quietly.  The dawn had grown almost day, and\\r\\nstill Curdie lingered, unwilling to disturb the princess.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt last, however, he called her, and she was in the room in a moment.\\r\\nShe had slept, she said, and felt quite fresh.  Delighted to find her\\r\\nfather still asleep, and so peacefully, she pushed her chair close to\\r\\nthe bed, and sat down with her hands in her lap.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie got his mattock from where he had hidden it behind a great\\r\\nmirror, and went to the cellar, followed by Lina.  They took some\\r\\nbreakfast with them as they passed through the hall, and as soon as\\r\\nthey had eaten it went out the back way.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt the mouth of the passage Curdie seized the rope, drew himself up,\\r\\npushed away the shutter, and entered the dungeon.  Then he swung the\\r\\nend of the rope to Lina, and she caught it in her teeth. When her\\r\\nmaster said, \\'Now, Lina!\\' she gave a great spring, and he ran away with\\r\\nthe end of the rope as fast as ever he could.  And such a spring had\\r\\nshe made, that by the time he had to bear her weight she was within a\\r\\nfew feet of the hole.  The instant she got a paw through, she was all\\r\\nthrough.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nApparently their enemies were waiting till hunger should have cowed\\r\\nthem, for there was no sign of any attempt having been made to open the\\r\\ndoor.  A blow or two of Curdie\\'s mattock drove the shattered lock clean\\r\\nfrom it, and telling Lina to wait there till he came back, and let no\\r\\none in, he walked out into the silent street, and drew the door to\\r\\nbehind them.  He could hardly believe it was not yet a whole day since\\r\\nhe had been thrown in there with his hands tied at his back.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDown the town he went, walking in the middle of the street, that, if\\r\\nany one saw him, he might see he was not afraid, and hesitate to rouse\\r\\nan attack on him.  As to the dogs, ever since the death of their two\\r\\ncompanions, a shadow that looked like a mattock was enough to make them\\r\\nscamper.  As soon as he reached the archway of the city gate he turned\\r\\nto reconnoitre the baker\\'s shop, and perceiving no sign of movement,\\r\\nwaited there watching for the first.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAfter about an hour, the door opened, and the baker\\'s man appeared with\\r\\na pail in his hand.  He went to a pump that stood in the street, and\\r\\nhaving filled his pail returned with it into the shop. Curdie stole\\r\\nafter him, found the door on the latch, opened it very gently, peeped\\r\\nin, saw nobody, and entered.  Remembering perfectly from what shelf the\\r\\nbaker\\'s wife had taken the loaf she said was the best, and seeing just\\r\\none upon it, he seized it, laid the price of it on the counter, and\\r\\nsped softly out, and up the street.  Once more in the dungeon beside\\r\\nLina, his first thought was to fasten up the door again, which would\\r\\nhave been easy, so many iron fragments of all sorts and sizes lay\\r\\nabout; but he bethought himself that if he left it as it was, and they\\r\\ncame to find him, they would conclude at once that they had made their\\r\\nescape by it, and would look no farther so as to discover the hole.  He\\r\\ntherefore merely pushed the door close and left it.  Then once more\\r\\ncarefully arranging the earth behind the shutter, so that it should\\r\\nagain fall with it, he returned to the cellar.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd now he had to convey the loaf to the princess.  If he could venture\\r\\nto take it himself, well; if not, he would send Lina.  He crept to the\\r\\ndoor of the servants\\' hall, and found the sleepers beginning to stir.\\r\\nOne said it was time to go to bed; another, that he would go to the\\r\\ncellar instead, and have a mug of wine to waken him up; while a third\\r\\nchallenged a fourth to give him his revenge at some game or other.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Oh, hang your losses!\\' answered his companion; \\'you\\'ll soon pick up\\r\\ntwice as much about the house, if you but keep your eyes open.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPerceiving there would be risk in attempting to pass through, and\\r\\nreflecting that the porters in the great hall would probably be awake\\r\\nalso, Curdie went back to the cellar, took Irene\\'s handkerchief with\\r\\nthe loaf in it, tied it round Lina\\'s neck, and told her to take it to\\r\\nthe princess.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nUsing every shadow and every shelter, Lina slid through the servants\\r\\nlike a shapeless terror through a guilty mind, and so, by corridor and\\r\\ngreat hall, up the stair to the king\\'s chamber.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIrene trembled a little when she saw her glide soundless in across the\\r\\nsilent dusk of the morning, that filtered through the heavy drapery of\\r\\nthe windows, but she recovered herself at once when she saw the bundle\\r\\nabout her neck, for it both assured her of Curdie\\'s safety, and gave\\r\\nher hope of her father\\'s.  She untied it with joy, and Lina stole away,\\r\\nsilent as she had come.  Her joy was the greater that the king had\\r\\nwaked up a little before, and expressed a desire for food\\xe2\\x80\\x94not that he\\r\\nfelt exactly hungry, he said, and yet he wanted something.  If only he\\r\\nmight have a piece of nice fresh bread!  Irene had no knife, but with\\r\\neager hands she broke a great piece from the loaf, and poured out a\\r\\nfull glass of wine. The king ate and drank, enjoyed the bread and the\\r\\nwine much, and instantly fell asleep again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was hours before the lazy people brought their breakfast.  When it\\r\\ncame, Irene crumbled a little about, threw some into the fireplace, and\\r\\nmanaged to make the tray look just as usual.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the meantime, down below in the cellar, Curdie was lying in the\\r\\nhollow between the upper sides of two of the great casks, the warmest\\r\\nplace he could find.  Lina was watching.  She lay at his feet, across\\r\\nthe two casks, and did her best so to arrange her huge tail that it\\r\\nshould be a warm coverlid for her master.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy and by Dr Kelman called to see his patient; and now that Irene\\'s\\r\\neyes were opened, she saw clearly enough that he was both annoyed and\\r\\npuzzled at finding His Majesty rather better.  He pretended however to\\r\\ncongratulate him, saying he believed he was quite fit to see the lord\\r\\nchamberlain: he wanted his signature to something important; only he\\r\\nmust not strain his mind to understand it, whatever it might be: if His\\r\\nMajesty did, he would not be answerable for the consequences.  The king\\r\\nsaid he would see the lord chamberlain, and the doctor went.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen Irene gave him more bread and wine, and the king ate and drank,\\r\\nand smiled a feeble smile, the first real one she had seen for many a\\r\\nday.  He said he felt much better, and would soon be able to take\\r\\nmatters into his own hands again.  He had a strange miserable feeling,\\r\\nhe said, that things were going terribly wrong, although he could not\\r\\ntell how.  Then the princess told him that Curdie had come, and that at\\r\\nnight, when all was quiet for nobody in the palace must know, he would\\r\\npay His Majesty a visit.  Her great-great-grandmother had sent him, she\\r\\nsaid.  The king looked strangely upon her, but the strange look passed\\r\\ninto a smile clearer than the first, and irene\\'s heart throbbed with\\r\\ndelight.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap22\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 22\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nThe Lord Chamberlain\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt noon the lord chamberlain appeared.  With a long, low bow, and paper\\r\\nin hand, he stepped softly into the room.  Greeting His Majesty with\\r\\nevery appearance of the profoundest respect, and congratulating him on\\r\\nthe evident progress he had made, he declared himself sorry to trouble\\r\\nhim, but there were certain papers, he said, which required his\\r\\nsignature\\xe2\\x80\\x94and therewith drew nearer to the king, who lay looking at\\r\\nhim doubtfully.  He was a lean, long, yellow man, with a small head,\\r\\nbald over the top, and tufted at the back and about the ears.  He had a\\r\\nvery thin, prominent, hooked nose, and a quantity of loose skin under\\r\\nhis chin and about the throat, which came craning up out of his\\r\\nneckcloth.  His eyes were very small, sharp, and glittering, and looked\\r\\nblack as jet.  He had hardly enough of a mouth to make a smile with.\\r\\nHis left hand held the paper, and the long, skinny fingers of his right\\r\\na pen just dipped in ink.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut the king, who for weeks had scarcely known what he did, was today\\r\\nso much himself as to be aware that he was not quite himself; and the\\r\\nmoment he saw the paper, he resolved that he would not sign without\\r\\nunderstanding and approving of it.  He requested the lord chamberlain\\r\\ntherefore to read it.  His Lordship commenced at once but the\\r\\ndifficulties he seemed to encounter, and the fits of stammering that\\r\\nseized him, roused the king\\'s suspicion tenfold. He called the princess.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I trouble His Lordship too much,\\' he said to her: \\'you can read print\\r\\nwell, my child\\xe2\\x80\\x94let me hear how you can read writing.  Take that paper\\r\\nfrom His Lordship\\'s hand, and read it to me from beginning to end,\\r\\nwhile my lord drinks a glass of my favourite wine, and watches for your\\r\\nblunders.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Pardon me, Your Majesty,\\' said the lord chamberlain, with as much of a\\r\\nsmile as he was able to extemporize, \\'but it were a thousand pities to\\r\\nput the attainments of Her Royal Highness to a test altogether too\\r\\nsevere.  Your Majesty can scarcely with justice expect the very organs\\r\\nof her speech to prove capable of compassing words so long, and to her\\r\\nso unintelligible.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I think much of my little princess and her capabilities,\\' returned the\\r\\nking, more and more aroused.  \\'Pray, my lord, permit her to try.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Consider, Your Majesty: the thing would be altogether without\\r\\nprecedent.  It would be to make sport of statecraft,\\' said the lord\\r\\nchamberlain.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Perhaps you are right, my lord,\\' answered the king, with more meaning\\r\\nthan he intended should be manifest, while to his growing joy he felt\\r\\nnew life and power throbbing in heart and brain.  \\'So this morning we\\r\\nshall read no further.  I am indeed ill able for business of such\\r\\nweight.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Will Your Majesty please sign your royal name here?\\' said the lord\\r\\nchamberlain, preferring the request as a matter of course, and\\r\\napproaching with the feather end of the pen pointed to a spot where\\r\\nthere was a great red seal.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Not today, my lord,\\' replied the king.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'It is of the greatest importance, Your Majesty,\\' softly insisted the\\r\\nother.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I descried no such importance in it,\\' said the king.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Your Majesty heard but a part.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'And I can hear no more today.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I trust Your Majesty has ground enough, in a case of necessity like\\r\\nthe present, to sign upon the representation of his loyal subject and\\r\\nchamberlain?  Or shall I call the lord chancellor?\\' he added, rising.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'There is no need.  I have the very highest opinion of your judgement,\\r\\nmy lord,\\' answered the king; \\'that is, with respect to means: we might\\r\\ndiffer as to ends.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe lord chamberlain made yet further attempts at persuasion; but they\\r\\ngrew feebler and feebler, and he was at last compelled to retire\\r\\nwithout having gained his object.  And well might his annoyance be\\r\\nkeen!  For that paper was the king\\'s will, drawn up by the\\r\\nattorney-general; nor until they had the king\\'s signature to it was\\r\\nthere much use in venturing farther.  But his worst sense of\\r\\ndiscomfiture arose from finding the king with so much capacity left,\\r\\nfor the doctor had pledged himself so to weaken his brain that he\\r\\nshould be as a child in their hands, incapable of refusing anything\\r\\nrequested of him: His Lordship began to doubt the doctor\\'s fidelity to\\r\\nthe conspiracy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe princess was in high delight.  She had not for weeks heard so many\\r\\nwords, not to say words of such strength and reason, from her father\\'s\\r\\nlips: day by day he had been growing weaker and more lethargic.  He was\\r\\nso much exhausted, however, after this effort, that he asked for\\r\\nanother piece of bread and more wine, and fell fast asleep the moment\\r\\nhe had taken them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe lord chamberlain sent in a rage for Dr Kelman.  He came, and while\\r\\nprofessing himself unable to understand the symptoms described by His\\r\\nLordship, yet pledged himself again that on the morrow the king should\\r\\ndo whatever was required of him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe day went on.  When His Majesty was awake, the princess read to\\r\\nhim\\xe2\\x80\\x94one storybook after another; and whatever she read, the king\\r\\nlistened as if he had never heard anything so good before, making out\\r\\nin it the wisest meanings.  Every now and then he asked for a piece of\\r\\nbread and a little wine, and every time he ate and drank he slept, and\\r\\nevery time he woke he seemed better than the last time.  The princess\\r\\nbearing her part, the loaf was eaten up and the flagon emptied before\\r\\nnight.  The butler took the flagon away, and brought it back filled to\\r\\nthe brim, but both were thirsty and hungry when Curdie came again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMeantime he and Lina, watching and waking alternately, had plenty of\\r\\nsleep.  In the afternoon, peeping from the recess, they saw several of\\r\\nthe servants enter hurriedly, one after the other, draw wine, drink it,\\r\\nand steal out; but their business was to take care of the king, not of\\r\\nhis cellar, and they let them drink.  Also, when the butler came to\\r\\nfill the flagon, they restrained themselves, for the villain\\'s fate was\\r\\nnot yet ready for him.  He looked terribly frightened, and had brought\\r\\nwith him a large candle and a small terrier\\xe2\\x80\\x94which latter indeed\\r\\nthreatened to be troublesome, for he went roving and sniffing about\\r\\nuntil he came to the recess where they were.  But as soon as he showed\\r\\nhimself, Lina opened her jaws so wide, and glared at him so horribly,\\r\\nthat, without even uttering a whimper, he tucked his tail between his\\r\\nlegs and ran to his master.  He was drawing the wicked wine at the\\r\\nmoment, and did not see him, else he would doubtless have run too.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen suppertime approached, Curdie took his place at the door into the\\r\\nservants\\' hall; but after a long hour\\'s vain watch, he began to fear he\\r\\nshould get nothing: there was so much idling about, as well as coming\\r\\nand going.  It was hard to bear\\xe2\\x80\\x94chiefly from the attractions of a\\r\\nsplendid loaf, just fresh out of the oven, which he longed to secure\\r\\nfor the king and princess.  At length his chance did arrive: he pounced\\r\\nupon the loaf and carried it away, and soon after got hold of a pie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThis time, however, both loaf and pie were missed.  The cook was\\r\\ncalled.  He declared he had provided both.  One of themselves, he said,\\r\\nmust have carried them away for some friend outside the palace.  Then a\\r\\nhousemaid, who had not long been one of them, said she had seen someone\\r\\nlike a page running in the direction of the cellar with something in\\r\\nhis hands.  Instantly all turned upon the pages, accusing them, one\\r\\nafter another.  All denied, but nobody believed one of them: Where\\r\\nthere is no truth there can be no faith.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTo the cellar they all set out to look for the missing pie and loaf.\\r\\nLina heard them coming, as well she might, for they were talking and\\r\\nquarrelling loud, and gave her master warning.  They snatched up\\r\\neverything, and got all signs of their presence out at the back door\\r\\nbefore the servants entered.  When they found nothing, they all turned\\r\\non the chambermaid, and accused her, not only of lying against the\\r\\npages, but of having taken the things herself.  Their language and\\r\\nbehaviour so disgusted Curdie, who could hear a great part of what\\r\\npassed, and he saw the danger of discovery now so much increased, that\\r\\nhe began to devise how best at once to rid the palace of the whole pack\\r\\nof them.  That, however, would be small gain so long as the treacherous\\r\\nofficers of state continued in it.  They must be first dealt with.  A\\r\\nthought came to him, and the longer he looked at it the better he liked\\r\\nit.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs soon as the servants were gone, quarrelling and accusing all the\\r\\nway, they returned and finished their supper.  Then Curdie, who had\\r\\nlong been satisfied that Lina understood almost every word he said,\\r\\ncommunicated his plan to her, and knew by the wagging of her tail and\\r\\nthe flashing of her eyes that she comprehended it.  Until they had the\\r\\nking safe through the worst part of the night, however, nothing could\\r\\nbe done.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey had now merely to go on waiting where they were till the household\\r\\nshould be asleep.  This waiting and waiting was much the hardest thing\\r\\nCurdie had to do in the whole affair.  He took his mattock and, going\\r\\nagain into the long passage, lighted a candle end and proceeded to\\r\\nexamine the rock on all sides.  But this was not merely to pass the\\r\\ntime: he had a reason for it.  When he broke the stone in the street,\\r\\nover which the baker fell, its appearance led him to pocket a fragment\\r\\nfor further examination; and since then he had satisfied himself that\\r\\nit was the kind of stone in which gold is found, and that the yellow\\r\\nparticles in it were pure metal.  If such stone existed here in any\\r\\nplenty, he could soon make the king rich and independent of his\\r\\nill-conditioned subjects. He was therefore now bent on an examination\\r\\nof the rock; nor had he been at it long before he was persuaded that\\r\\nthere were large quantities of gold in the half-crystalline white\\r\\nstone, with its veins of opaque white and of green, of which the rock,\\r\\nso far as he had been able to inspect it, seemed almost entirely to\\r\\nconsist. Every piece he broke was spotted with particles and little\\r\\nlumps of a lovely greenish yellow\\xe2\\x80\\x94and that was gold.  Hitherto he had\\r\\nworked only in silver, but he had read, and heard talk, and knew,\\r\\ntherefore, about gold.  As soon as he had got the king free of rogues\\r\\nand villains, he would have all the best and most honest miners, with\\r\\nhis father at the head of them, to work this rock for the king.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was a great delight to him to use his mattock once more.  The time\\r\\nwent quickly, and when he left the passage to go to the king\\'s chamber,\\r\\nhe had already a good heap of fragments behind the broken door.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap23\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 23\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nDr Kelman\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs soon as he had reason to hope the way was clear, Curdie ventured\\r\\nsoftly into the hall, with Lina behind him.  There was no one asleep on\\r\\nthe bench or floor, but by the fading fire sat a girl weeping.  It was\\r\\nthe same who had seen him carrying off the food, and had been so hardly\\r\\nused for saying so.  She opened her eyes when he appeared, but did not\\r\\nseem frightened at him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I know why you weep,\\' said Curdie, \\'and I am sorry for you.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'It is hard not to be believed just because one speaks the truth,\\' said\\r\\nthe girl, \\'but that seems reason enough with some people.  My mother\\r\\ntaught me to speak the truth, and took such pains with me that I should\\r\\nfind it hard to tell a lie, though I could invent many a story these\\r\\nservants would believe at once; for the truth is a strange thing here,\\r\\nand they don\\'t know it when they see it. Show it them, and they all\\r\\nstare as if it were a wicked lie, and that with the lie yet warm that\\r\\nhas just left their own mouths! You are a stranger,\\' she said, and\\r\\nburst out weeping afresh, \\'but the stranger you are to such a place and\\r\\nsuch people the better!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I am the person,\\' said Curdie, whom you saw carrying the things from\\r\\nthe supper table.\\'  He showed her the loaf.  \\'If you can trust, as well\\r\\nas speak the truth, I will trust you.  Can you trust me?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe looked at him steadily for a moment.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I can,\\' she answered.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'One thing more,\\' said Curdie: \\'have you courage as well as truth?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I think so.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Look my dog in the face and don\\'t cry out.  Come here, Lina.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLina obeyed.  The girl looked at her, and laid her hand on Lina\\'s head.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Now I know you are a true woman,\\' said curdie.  \\'I am come to set\\r\\nthings right in this house.  Not one of the servants knows I am here.\\r\\nWill you tell them tomorrow morning that, if they do not alter their\\r\\nways, and give over drinking, and lying, and stealing, and unkindness,\\r\\nthey shall every one of them be driven from the palace?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'They will not believe me.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Most likely; but will you give them the chance?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I will.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Then I will be your friend.  Wait here till I come again.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe looked him once more in the face, and sat down.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen he reached the royal chamber, he found His Majesty awake, and very\\r\\nanxiously expecting him.  He received him with the utmost kindness, and\\r\\nat once, as it were, put himself in his hands by telling him all he\\r\\nknew concerning the state he was in.  His voice was feeble, but his eye\\r\\nwas clear, although now and then his words and thoughts seemed to\\r\\nwander.  Curdie could not be certain that the cause of their not being\\r\\nintelligible to him did not lie in himself.  The king told him that for\\r\\nsome years, ever since his queen\\'s death, he had been losing heart over\\r\\nthe wickedness of his people.  He had tried hard to make them good, but\\r\\nthey got worse and worse.  Evil teachers, unknown to him, had crept\\r\\ninto the schools; there was a general decay of truth and right\\r\\nprinciple at least in the city; and as that set the example to the\\r\\nnation, it must spread.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe main cause of his illness was the despondency with which the\\r\\ndegeneration of his people affected him.  He could not sleep, and had\\r\\nterrible dreams; while, to his unspeakable shame and distress, he\\r\\ndoubted almost everybody.  He had striven against his suspicion, but in\\r\\nvain, and his heart was sore, for his courtiers and councillors were\\r\\nreally kind; only he could not think why none of their ladies came near\\r\\nhis princess.  The whole country was discontented, he heard, and there\\r\\nwere signs of gathering storm outside as well as inside his borders.\\r\\nThe master of the horse gave him sad news of the insubordination of the\\r\\narmy; and his great white horse was dead, they told him; and his sword\\r\\nhad lost its temper: it bent double the last time he tried it!\\xe2\\x80\\x94only\\r\\nperhaps that was in a dream; and they could not find his shield; and\\r\\none of his spurs had lost the rowel.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThus the poor king went wandering in a maze of sorrows, some of which\\r\\nwere purely imaginary, while others were truer than he understood.  He\\r\\ntold how thieves came at night and tried to take his crown, so that he\\r\\nnever dared let it out of his hands even when he slept; and how, every\\r\\nnight, an evil demon in the shape of his physician came and poured\\r\\npoison down his throat.  He knew it to be poison, he said, somehow,\\r\\nalthough it tasted like wine.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHere he stopped, faint with the unusual exertion of talking.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie seized the flagon, and ran to the wine cellar.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the servants\\' hall the girl still sat by the fire, waiting for him.\\r\\nAs he returned he told her to follow him, and left her at the chamber\\r\\ndoor until he should rejoin her.  When the king had had a little wine,\\r\\nhe informed him that he had already discovered certain of His Majesty\\'s\\r\\nenemies, and one of the worst of them was the doctor, for it was no\\r\\nother demon than the doctor himself who had been coming every night,\\r\\nand giving him a slow poison.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'So!\\' said the king.  \\'Then I have not been suspicious enough, for I\\r\\nthought it was but a dream!  Is it possible Kelman can be such a\\r\\nwretch?  Who then am I to trust?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Not one in the house, except the princess and myself,\\' said Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I will not go to sleep,\\' said the king.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'That would be as bad as taking the poison,\\' said Curdie.  \\'No, no,\\r\\nsire; you must show your confidence by leaving all the watching to me,\\r\\nand doing all the sleeping Your Majesty can.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe king smiled a contented smile, turned on his side, and was\\r\\npresently fast asleep.  Then Curdie persuaded the princess also to go\\r\\nto sleep, and telling Lina to watch, went to the housemaid.  He asked\\r\\nher if she could inform him which of the council slept in the palace,\\r\\nand show him their rooms.  She knew every one of them, she said, and\\r\\ntook him the round of all their doors, telling him which slept in each\\r\\nroom.  He then dismissed her, and returning to the king\\'s chamber,\\r\\nseated himself behind a curtain at the head of the bed, on the side\\r\\nfarthest from the king.  He told Lina to get under the bed, and make no\\r\\nnoise.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAbout one o\\'clock the doctor came stealing in.  He looked round for the\\r\\nprincess, and seeing no one, smiled with satisfaction as he approached\\r\\nthe wine where it stood under the lamp.  Having partly filled a glass,\\r\\nhe took from his pocket a small phial, and filled up the glass from it.\\r\\nThe light fell upon his face from above, and Curdie saw the snake in it\\r\\nplainly visible.  He had never beheld such an evil countenance: the man\\r\\nhated the king, and delighted in doing him wrong.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWith the glass in his hand, he drew near the bed, set it down, and\\r\\nbegan his usual rude rousing of His Majesty.  Not at once succeeding,\\r\\nhe took a lancet from his pocket, and was parting its cover with an\\r\\ninvoluntary hiss of hate between his closed teeth, when Curdie stooped\\r\\nand whispered to Lina.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Take him by the leg, Lina.\\'  She darted noiselessly upon him. With a\\r\\nface of horrible consternation, he gave his leg one tug to free it; the\\r\\nnext instant Curdie heard the one scrunch with which she crushed the\\r\\nbone like a stick of celery.  He tumbled on the floor with a yell.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Drag him out, Lina,\\' said Curdie. Lina took him by the collar, and\\r\\ndragged him out.  Her master followed her to direct her, and they left\\r\\nthe doctor lying across the lord chamberlain\\'s door, where he gave\\r\\nanother horrible yell, and fainted.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe king had waked at his first cry, and by the time Curdie re-entered\\r\\nhe had got at his sword where it hung from the centre of the tester,\\r\\nhad drawn it, and was trying to get out of bed.  But when Curdie told\\r\\nhim all was well, he lay down again as quietly as a child comforted by\\r\\nhis mother from a troubled dream.  Curdie went to the door to watch.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe doctor\\'s yells had aroused many, but not one had yet ventured to\\r\\nappear.  Bells were rung violently, but none were answered; and in a\\r\\nminute or two Curdie had what he was watching for.  The door of the\\r\\nlord chamberlain\\'s room opened, and, pale with hideous terror, His\\r\\nLordship peeped out.  Seeing no one, he advanced to step into the\\r\\ncorridor, and tumbled over the doctor.  Curdie ran up, and held out his\\r\\nhand.  He received in it the claw of a bird of prey\\xe2\\x80\\x94vulture or eagle,\\r\\nhe could not tell which.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHis Lordship, as soon as he was on his legs, taking him for one of the\\r\\npages abused him heartily for not coming sooner, and threatened him\\r\\nwith dismissal from the king\\'s service for cowardice and neglect.  He\\r\\nbegan indeed what bade fair to be a sermon on the duties of a page, but\\r\\ncatching sight of the man who lay at his door, and seeing it was the\\r\\ndoctor, he fell upon Curdie afresh for standing there doing nothing,\\r\\nand ordered him to fetch immediate assistance.  Curdie left him, but\\r\\nslipped into the King\\'s chamber, closed and locked the door, and left\\r\\nthe rascals to look after each other.  Ere long he heard hurrying\\r\\nfootsteps, and for a few minutes there was a great muffled tumult of\\r\\nscuffling feet, low voices and deep groanings; then all was still again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIrene slept through the whole\\xe2\\x80\\x94so confidently did she rest, knowing\\r\\nCurdie was in her father\\'s room watching over him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap24\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 24\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nThe Prophecy\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie sat and watched every motion of the sleeping king.  All the\\r\\nnight, to his ear, the palace lay as quiet as a nursery of healthful\\r\\nchildren.

He went off again in\\r\\na minute or so; but for a little while he was restless, and once when\\r\\nhe lifted his hand it came down on the spikes of his crown, and he half\\r\\nwaked.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'But where is the crown?\\' cried Irene, in sudden terror.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I stroked his hands,\\' answered Curdie, \\'and took the crown from them;\\r\\nand ever since he has slept quietly, and again and again smiled in his\\r\\nsleep.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I have never seen him do that,\\' said the princess.  \\'But what have you\\r\\ndone with the crown, Curdie?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Look,\\' said Curdie, moving away from the bedside.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIrene followed him\\xe2\\x80\\x94and there, in the middle of the floor, she saw a\\r\\nstrange sight.  Lina lay at full length, fast asleep, her tail\\r\\nstretched out straight behind her and her forelegs before her: between\\r\\nthe two paws meeting in front of it, her nose just touching it behind,\\r\\nglowed and flashed the crown, like a nest of the humming birds of\\r\\nheaven.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIrene gazed, and looked up with a smile.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'But what if the thief were to come, and she not to wake?\\' she said.\\r\\n\\'Shall I try her?\\'  And as she spoke she stooped toward the crown.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'No, no, no!\\' cried Curdie, terrified.  \\'She would frighten you out of\\r\\nyour wits.  I would do it to show you, but she would wake your father.\\r\\nYou have no conception with what a roar she would spring at my throat.\\r\\nBut you shall see how lightly she wakes the moment I speak to her.\\r\\nLina!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe was on her feet the same instant, with her great tail sticking out\\r\\nstraight behind her, just as it had been lying.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Good dog!\\' said the princess, and patted her head.  Lina wagged her\\r\\ntail solemnly, like the boom of an anchored sloop.  Irene took the\\r\\ncrown, and laid it where the king would see it when he woke.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Now, Princess,\\' said Curdie, \\'I must leave you for a few minutes. You\\r\\nmust bolt the door, please, and not open it to any one.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAway to the cellar he went with Lina, taking care, as they passed\\r\\nthrough the servants\\' hall, to get her a good breakfast.  In about one\\r\\nminute she had eaten what he gave her, and looked up in his face: it\\r\\nwas not more she wanted, but work.  So out of the cellar they went\\r\\nthrough the passage, and Curdie into the dungeon, where he pulled up\\r\\nLina, opened the door, let her out, and shut it again behind her.  As\\r\\nhe reached the door of the king\\'s chamber, Lina was flying out of the\\r\\ngate of Gwyntystorm as fast as her mighty legs could carry her.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'What\\'s come to the wench?\\' growled the menservants one to another,\\r\\nwhen the chambermaid appeared among them the next morning.  There was\\r\\nsomething in her face which they could not understand, and did not like.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Are we all dirt?\\' they said.  \\'What are you thinking about?  Have you\\r\\nseen yourself in the glass this morning, miss?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe made no answer.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Do you want to be treated as you deserve, or will you speak, you\\r\\nhussy?\\' said the first woman-cook.  \\'I would fain know what right you\\r\\nhave to put on a face like that!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'You won\\'t believe me,\\' said the girl.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Of course not.  What is it?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I must tell you, whether you believe me or not,\\' she said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Of course you must.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'It is this, then: if you do not repent of your bad ways, you are all\\r\\ngoing to be punished\\xe2\\x80\\x94all turned out of the palace together.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'A mighty punishment!\\' said the butler.  \\'A good riddance, say I, of\\r\\nthe trouble of keeping minxes like you in order!  And why, pray, should\\r\\nwe be turned out?  What have I to repent of now, your holiness?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'That you know best yourself,\\' said the girl.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'A pretty piece of insolence!  How should I know, forsooth, what a\\r\\nmenial like you has got against me!  There are people in this\\r\\nhouse\\xe2\\x80\\x94oh! I\\'m not blind to their ways!\\xe2\\x80\\x94but every one for himself, say\\r\\nI!  Pray, Miss judgement, who gave you such an impertinent message to\\r\\nHis Majesty\\'s household?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'One who is come to set things right in the king\\'s house.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Right, indeed!\\' cried the butler; but that moment the thought came\\r\\nback to him of the roar he had heard in the cellar, and he turned pale\\r\\nand was silent.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe steward took it up next.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'And pray, pretty prophetess,\\' he said, attempting to chuck her under\\r\\nthe chin, \\'what have I got to repent of?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'That you know best yourself,\\' said the girl.  \\'You have but to look\\r\\ninto your books or your heart.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Can you tell me, then, what I have to repent of?\\' said the groom of\\r\\nthe chambers.  \\'That you know best yourself,\\' said the girl once more.\\r\\n\\'The person who told me to tell you said the servants of this house had\\r\\nto repent of thieving, and lying, and unkindness, and drinking; and\\r\\nthey will be made to repent of them one way, if they don\\'t do it of\\r\\nthemselves another.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen arose a great hubbub; for by this time all the servants in the\\r\\nhouse were gathered about her, and all talked together, in towering\\r\\nindignation.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Thieving, indeed!\\' cried one.  \\'A pretty word in a house where\\r\\neverything is left lying about in a shameless way, tempting poor\\r\\ninnocent girls!  A house where nobody cares for anything, or has the\\r\\nleast respect to the value of property!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I suppose you envy me this brooch of mine,\\' said another.  \\'There was\\r\\njust a half sheet of note paper about it, not a scrap more, in a drawer\\r\\nthat\\'s always open in the writing table in the study! What sort of a\\r\\nplace is that for a jewel?  Can you call it stealing to take a thing\\r\\nfrom such a place as that?  Nobody cared a straw about it.  It might as\\r\\nwell have been in the dust hole!  If it had been locked up\\xe2\\x80\\x94then, to be\\r\\nsure!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Drinking!\\' said the chief porter, with a husky laugh.  \\'And who\\r\\nwouldn\\'t drink when he had a chance?  Or who would repent it, except\\r\\nthat the drink was gone?  Tell me that, Miss Innocence.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Lying!\\' said a great, coarse footman.  \\'I suppose you mean when I told\\r\\nyou yesterday you were a pretty girl when you didn\\'t pout? Lying,\\r\\nindeed!  Tell us something worth repenting of!  Lying is the way of\\r\\nGwyntystorm.  You should have heard Jabez lying to the cook last night!\\r\\nHe wanted a sweetbread for his pup, and pretended it was for the\\r\\nprincess!  Ha! ha! ha!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Unkindness!  I wonder who\\'s unkind!  Going and listening to any\\r\\nstranger against her fellow servants, and then bringing back his wicked\\r\\nwords to trouble them!\\' said the oldest and worst of the housemaids.\\r\\n\\'One of ourselves, too!  Come, you hypocrite!  This is all an invention\\r\\nof yours and your young man\\'s, to take your revenge of us because we\\r\\nfound you out in a lie last night.  Tell true now: wasn\\'t it the same\\r\\nthat stole the loaf and the pie that sent you with the impudent\\r\\nmessage?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs she said this, she stepped up to the housemaid and gave her, instead\\r\\nof time to answer, a box on the ear that almost threw her down; and\\r\\nwhoever could get at her began to push and bustle and pinch and punch\\r\\nher.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'You invite your fate,\\' she said quietly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey fell furiously upon her, drove her from the hall with kicks and\\r\\nblows, hustled her along the passage, and threw her down the stair to\\r\\nthe wine cellar, then locked the door at the top of it, and went back\\r\\nto their breakfast.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the meantime the king and the princess had had their bread and wine,\\r\\nand the princess, with Curdie\\'s help, had made the room as tidy as she\\r\\ncould\\xe2\\x80\\x94they were terribly neglected by the servants. And now Curdie set\\r\\nhimself to interest and amuse the king, and prevent him from thinking\\r\\ntoo much, in order that he might the sooner think the better.\\r\\nPresently, at His Majesty\\'s request, he began from the beginning, and\\r\\ntold everything he could recall of his life, about his father and\\r\\nmother and their cottage on the mountain, of the inside of the mountain\\r\\nand the work there, about the goblins and his adventures with them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen he came to finding the princess and her nurse overtaken by the\\r\\ntwilight on the mountain, Irene took up her share of the tale, and told\\r\\nall about herself to that point, and then Curdie took it up again; and\\r\\nso they went on, each fitting in the part that the other did not know,\\r\\nthus keeping the hoop of the story running straight; and the king\\r\\nlistened with wondering and delighted ears, astonished to find what he\\r\\ncould so ill comprehend, yet fitting so well together from the lips of\\r\\ntwo narrators.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt last, with the mission given him by the wonderful princess and his\\r\\nconsequent adventures, Curdie brought up the whole tale to the present\\r\\nmoment.  Then a silence fell, and Irene and Curdie thought the king was\\r\\nasleep.  But he was far from it; he was thinking about many things.\\r\\nAfter a long pause he said:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Now at last, MY children, I am compelled to believe many things I\\r\\ncould not and do not yet understand\\xe2\\x80\\x94things I used to hear, and\\r\\nsometimes see, as often as I visited my mother\\'s home.  Once, for\\r\\ninstance, I heard my mother say to her father\\xe2\\x80\\x94speaking of me\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"He is a\\r\\ngood, honest boy, but he will be an old man before he understands\"; and\\r\\nmy grandfather answered, \"Keep up your heart, child: my mother will\\r\\nlook after him.\"  I thought often of their words, and the many strange\\r\\nthings besides I both heard and saw in that house; but by degrees,\\r\\nbecause I could not understand them, I gave up thinking of them.  And\\r\\nindeed I had almost forgotten them, when you, my child, talking that\\r\\nday about the Queen Irene and her pigeons, and what you had seen in her\\r\\ngarret, brought them all back to my mind in a vague mass.  But now they\\r\\nkeep coming back to me, one by one, every one for itself; and I shall\\r\\njust hold my peace, and lie here quite still, and think about them all\\r\\ntill I get well again.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhat he meant they could not quite understand, but they saw plainly\\r\\nthat already he was better.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Put away my crown,\\' he said.  \\'I am tired of seeing it, and have no\\r\\nmore any fear of its safety.\\'  They put it away together, withdrew from\\r\\nthe bedside, and left him in peace.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap25\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 25\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nThe Avengers\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere was nothing now to be dreaded from Dr Kelman, but it made Curdie\\r\\nanxious, as the evening drew near, to think that not a soul belonging\\r\\nto the court had been to visit the king, or ask how he did, that day.\\r\\nHe feared, in some shape or other, a more determined assault.  He had\\r\\nprovided himself a place in the room, to which he might retreat upon\\r\\napproach, and whence he could watch; but not once had he had to betake\\r\\nhimself to it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTowards night the king fell asleep.  Curdie thought more and more\\r\\nuneasily of the moment when he must again leave them for a little\\r\\nwhile.  Deeper and deeper fell the shadows.  No one came to light the\\r\\nlamp.  The princess drew her chair close to Curdie: she would rather it\\r\\nwere not so dark, she said.  She was afraid of something\\xe2\\x80\\x94she could not\\r\\ntell what; nor could she give any reason for her fear but that all was\\r\\nso dreadfully still.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen it had been dark about an hour, Curdie thought Lina might have\\r\\nreturned; and reflected that the sooner he went the less danger was\\r\\nthere of any assault while he was away.  There was more risk of his own\\r\\npresence being discovered, no doubt, but things were now drawing to a\\r\\ncrisis, and it must be run.  So, telling the princess to lock all the\\r\\ndoors of the bedchamber, and let no one in, he took his mattock, and\\r\\nwith here a run, and there a halt under cover, gained the door at the\\r\\nhead of the cellar stair in safety.  To his surprise he found it\\r\\nlocked, and the key was gone.  There was no time for deliberation.  He\\r\\nfelt where the lock was, and dealt it a tremendous blow with his\\r\\nmattock.  It needed but a second to dash the door open.  Someone laid a\\r\\nhand on his arm.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Who is it?\\' said Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I told you they wouldn\\'t believe me, sir,\\' said the housemaid.  \\'I\\r\\nhave been here all day.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe took her hand, and said, \\'You are a good, brave girl.  Now come with\\r\\nme, lest your enemies imprison you again.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe took her to the cellar, locked the door, lighted a bit of candle,\\r\\ngave her a little wine, told her to wait there till he came, and went\\r\\nout the back way.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSwiftly he swung himself up into the dungeon.  Lina had done her part.\\r\\nThe place was swarming with creatures\\xe2\\x80\\x94animal forms wilder and more\\r\\ngrotesque than ever ramped in nightmare dream.  Close by the hole,\\r\\nwaiting his coming, her green eyes piercing the gulf below, Lina had\\r\\nbut just laid herself down when he appeared.  All about the vault and\\r\\nup the slope of the rubbish heap lay and stood and squatted the\\r\\nforty-nine whose friendship Lina had conquered in the wood.  They all\\r\\ncame crowding about Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe must get them into the cellar as quickly as ever he could.  But when\\r\\nhe looked at the size of some of them, he feared it would be a long\\r\\nbusiness to enlarge the hole sufficiently to let them through.  At it\\r\\nhe rushed, hitting vigorously at the edge with his mattock.  At the\\r\\nvery first blow came a splash from the water beneath, but ere he could\\r\\nheave a third, a creature like a tapir, only that the grasping point of\\r\\nits proboscis was hard as the steel of Curdie\\'s hammer, pushed him\\r\\ngently aside, making room for another creature, with a head like a\\r\\ngreat club, which it began banging upon the floor with terrible force\\r\\nand noise.  After about a minute of this battery, the tapir came up\\r\\nagain, shoved Clubhead aside, and putting its own head into the hole\\r\\nbegan gnawing at the sides of it with the finger of its nose, in such a\\r\\nfashion that the fragments fell in a continuous gravelly shower into\\r\\nthe water.  In a few minutes the opening was large enough for the\\r\\nbiggest creature among them to get through it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNext came the difficulty of letting them down: some were quite light,\\r\\nbut the half of them were too heavy for the rope, not to say for his\\r\\narms.  The creatures themselves seemed to be puzzling where or how they\\r\\nwere to go.  One after another of them came up, looked down through the\\r\\nhole, and drew back.  Curdie thought if he let Lina down, perhaps that\\r\\nwould suggest something; possibly they did not see the opening on the\\r\\nother side.  He did so, and Lina stood lighting up the entrance of the\\r\\npassage with her gleaming eyes.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOne by one the creatures looked down again, and one by one they drew\\r\\nback, each standing aside to glance at the next, as if to say, Now you\\r\\nhave a look.  At last it came to the turn of the serpent with the long\\r\\nbody, the four short legs behind, and the little wings before.  No\\r\\nsooner had he poked his head through than he poked it farther\\r\\nthrough\\xe2\\x80\\x94and farther, and farther yet, until there was little more than\\r\\nhis legs left in the dungeon.  By that time he had got his head and\\r\\nneck well into the passage beside Lina.  Then his legs gave a great\\r\\nwaddle and spring, and he tumbled himself, far as there was betwixt\\r\\nthem, heels over head into the passage.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'That is all very well for you, Mr Legserpent!\\' thought Curdie to\\r\\nhimself; \\'but what is to be done with the rest?\\'  He had hardly time to\\r\\nthink it, however, before the creature\\'s head appeared again through\\r\\nthe floor.  He caught hold of the bar of iron to which Curdie\\'s rope\\r\\nwas tied, and settling it securely across the narrowest part of the\\r\\nirregular opening, held fast to it with his teeth.  It was plain to\\r\\nCurdie, from the universal hardness among them, that they must all, at\\r\\none time or another, have been creatures of the mines.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe saw at once what this one was after.  The beast had planted his feet\\r\\nfirmly upon the floor of the passage, and stretched his long body up\\r\\nand across the chasm to serve as a bridge for the rest. Curdie mounted\\r\\ninstantly upon his neck, threw his arms round him as far as they would\\r\\ngo, and slid down in ease and safety, the bridge just bending a little\\r\\nas his weight glided over it.  But he thought some of the creatures\\r\\nwould try the legserpent\\'s teeth.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOne by one the oddities followed, and slid down in safety.  When they\\r\\nseemed to be all landed, he counted them: there were but forty-eight.\\r\\nUp the rope again he went, and found one which had been afraid to trust\\r\\nhimself to the bridge, and no wonder! for he had neither legs nor head\\r\\nnor arms nor tail: he was just a round thing, about a foot in diameter,\\r\\nwith a nose and mouth and eyes on one side of the ball.  He had made\\r\\nhis journey by rolling as swiftly as the fleetest of them could run.\\r\\nThe back of the legserpent not being flat, he could not quite trust\\r\\nhimself to roll straight and not drop into the gulf.  Curdie took him\\r\\nin his arms, and the moment he looked down through the hole, the bridge\\r\\nmade itself again, and he slid into the passage in safety, with\\r\\nBallbody in his bosom.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe ran first to the cellar to warn the girl not to be frightened at the\\r\\navengers of wickedness.  Then he called to Lina to bring in her friends.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOne after another they came trooping in, till the cellar seemed full of\\r\\nthem.  The housemaid regarded them without fear.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Sir,\\' she said, \\'there is one of the pages I don\\'t take to be a bad\\r\\nfellow.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Then keep him near you,\\' said Curdie.  \\'And now can you show me a way\\r\\nto the king\\'s chamber not through the servants\\' hall?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'There is a way through the chamber of the colonel of the guard,\\' she\\r\\nanswered, \\'but he is ill, and in bed.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Take me that way,\\' said Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy many ups and downs and windings and turnings she brought him to a\\r\\ndimly lighted room, where lay an elderly man asleep.  His arm was\\r\\noutside the coverlid, and Curdie gave his hand a hurried grasp as he\\r\\nwent by.  His heart beat for joy, for he had found a good, honest,\\r\\nhuman hand.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I suppose that is why he is ill,\\' he said to himself.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was now close upon suppertime, and when the girl stopped at the door\\r\\nof the king\\'s chamber, he told her to go and give the servants one\\r\\nwarning more.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Say the messenger sent you,\\' he said.  \\'I will be with you very soon.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe king was still asleep.  Curdie talked to the princess for a few\\r\\nminutes, told her not to be frightened whatever noises she heard, only\\r\\nto keep her door locked till he came, and left her.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap26\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 26\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nThe Vengeance\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy the time the girl reached the servants\\' hall they were seated at\\r\\nsupper.  A loud, confused exclamation arose when she entered.  No one\\r\\nmade room for her; all stared with unfriendly eyes.  A page, who\\r\\nentered the next minute by another door, came to her side.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Where do you come from, hussy?\\' shouted the butler, and knocked his\\r\\nfist on the table with a loud clang.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe had gone to fetch wine, had found the stair door broken open and the\\r\\ncellar door locked, and had turned and fled.  Among his fellows,\\r\\nhowever, he had now regained what courage could be called his.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'From the cellar,\\' she replied.  \\'The messenger broke open the door,\\r\\nand sent me to you again.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'The messenger!

If anybody here has anything to\\r\\nrepent Of, isn\\'t that enough\\xe2\\x80\\x94and more than enough for him\\xe2\\x80\\x94but you\\r\\nmust come bothering about, and stirring up, till not a drop of quiet\\r\\nwill settle inside him?

I should like to hear him!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Then hear him now,\\' said Curdie, who that moment entered at the\\r\\nopposite corner of the hall.  \\'I speak of the butler in particular when\\r\\nI say that I know more evil of him than of any of the rest. He will not\\r\\nlet either his own conscience or my messenger speak to him: I therefore\\r\\nnow speak myself.  I proclaim him a villain, and a traitor to His\\r\\nMajesty the king.  But what better is any one of you who cares only for\\r\\nhimself, eats, drinks, takes good money, and gives vile service in\\r\\nreturn, stealing and wasting the king\\'s property, and making of the\\r\\npalace, which ought to be an example of order and sobriety, a disgrace\\r\\nto the country?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor a moment all stood astonished into silence by this bold speech from\\r\\na stranger.  True, they saw by his mattock over his shoulder that he\\r\\nwas nothing but a miner boy, yet for a moment the truth told\\r\\nnotwithstanding.  Then a great roaring laugh burst from the biggest of\\r\\nthe footmen as he came shouldering his way through the crowd toward\\r\\nCurdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Yes, I\\'m right,\\' he cried; \\'I thought as much!  This messenger,\\r\\nforsooth, is nothing but a gallows bird\\xe2\\x80\\x94a fellow the city marshal was\\r\\ngoing to hang, but unfortunately put it off till he should be starved\\r\\nenough to save rope and be throttled with a pack thread. He broke\\r\\nprison, and here he is preaching!\\'  As he spoke, he stretched out his\\r\\ngreat hand to lay hold of him.  Curdie caught it in his left hand, and\\r\\nheaved his mattock with the other.  Finding, however, nothing worse\\r\\nthan an ox hoof, he restrained himself, stepped back a pace or two,\\r\\nshifted his mattock to his left hand, and struck him a little smart\\r\\nblow on the shoulder.  His arm dropped by his side, he gave a roar, and\\r\\ndrew back.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHis fellows came crowding upon Curdie.  Some called to the dogs; others\\r\\nswore; the women screamed; the footmen and pages got round him in a\\r\\nhalf circle, which he kept from closing by swinging his mattock, and\\r\\nhere and there threatening a blow.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Whoever confesses to having done anything wrong in this house, however\\r\\nsmall, however great, and means to do better, let him come to this\\r\\ncorner of the room,\\' he cried.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNone moved but the page, who went toward him skirting the wall. When\\r\\nthey caught sight of him, the crowd broke into a hiss of derision.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'There!  See!  Look at the sinner!  He confesses!  Actually confesses!\\r\\nCome, what is it you stole?  The barefaced hypocrite! There\\'s your sort\\r\\nto set up for reproving other people!  Where\\'s the other now?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut the maid had left the room, and they let the page pass, for he\\r\\nlooked dangerous to stop.  Curdie had just put him betwixt him and the\\r\\nwall, behind the door, when in rushed the butler with the huge kitchen\\r\\npoker, the point of which he had blown red-hot in the fire, followed by\\r\\nthe cook with his longest spit.  Through the crowd, which scattered\\r\\nright and left before them, they came down upon Curdie.  Uttering a\\r\\nshrill whistle, he caught the poker a blow with his mattock, knocking\\r\\nthe point to the ground, while the page behind him started forward, and\\r\\nseizing the point of the spit, held on to it with both hands, the cook\\r\\nkicking him furiously.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEre the butler could raise the poker again, or the cook recover the\\r\\nspit, with a roar to terrify the dead, Lina dashed into the room, her\\r\\neyes flaming like candles.  She went straight at the butler. He was\\r\\ndown in a moment, and she on the top of him, wagging her tail over him\\r\\nlike a lioness.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Don\\'t kill him, Lina,\\' said Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Oh, Mr Miner!\\' cried the butler.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Put your foot on his mouth, Lina,\\' said Curdie.  \\'The truth Fear tells\\r\\nis not much better than her lies.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe rest of the creatures now came stalking, rolling, leaping, gliding,\\r\\nhobbling into the room, and each as he came took the next place along\\r\\nthe wall, until, solemn and grotesque, all stood ranged, awaiting\\r\\norders.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd now some of the culprits were stealing to the doors nearest them.\\r\\nCurdie whispered to the two creatures next him.  Off went Ballbody,\\r\\nrolling and bounding through the crowd like a spent cannon shot, and\\r\\nwhen the foremost reached the door to the corridor, there he lay at the\\r\\nfoot of it grinning; to the other door scuttled a scorpion, as big as a\\r\\nhuge crab.  The rest stood so still that some began to think they were\\r\\nonly boys dressed up to look awful; they persuaded themselves they were\\r\\nonly another part of the housemaid\\'s and page\\'s vengeful contrivance,\\r\\nand their evil spirits began to rise again.  Meantime Curdie had, with\\r\\na second sharp blow from the hammer of his mattock, disabled the cook,\\r\\nso that he yielded the spit with a groan.  He now turned to the\\r\\navengers.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Go at them,\\' he said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe whole nine-and-forty obeyed at once, each for himself, and after\\r\\nhis own fashion.  A scene of confusion and terror followed. The crowd\\r\\nscattered like a dance of flies.  The creatures had been instructed not\\r\\nto hurt much, but to hunt incessantly, until everyone had rushed from\\r\\nthe house.  The women shrieked, and ran hither and thither through the\\r\\nhall, pursued each by her own horror, and snapped at by every other in\\r\\npassing.  If one threw herself down in hysterical despair, she was\\r\\ninstantly poked or clawed or nibbled up again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThough they were quite as frightened at first, the men did not run so\\r\\nfast; and by and by some of them finding they were only glared at, and\\r\\nfollowed, and pushed, began to summon up courage once more, and with\\r\\ncourage came impudence.  The tapir had the big footman in charge: the\\r\\nfellow stood stock-still, and let the beast come up to him, then put\\r\\nout his finger and playfully patted his nose.  The tapir gave the nose\\r\\na little twist, and the finger lay on the floor.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen indeed did the footman run.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nGradually the avengers grew more severe, and the terrors of the\\r\\nimagination were fast yielding to those of sensuous experience, when a\\r\\npage, perceiving one of the doors no longer guarded, sprang at it, and\\r\\nran out.  Another and another followed.  Not a beast went after, until,\\r\\none by one, they were every one gone from the hall, and the whole crew\\r\\nin the kitchen.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere they were beginning to congratulate themselves that all was over,\\r\\nwhen in came the creatures trooping after them, and the second act of\\r\\ntheir terror and pain began.  They were flung about in all directions;\\r\\ntheir clothes were torn from them; they were pinched and scratched any-\\r\\nand everywhere; Ballbody kept rolling up them and over them, confining\\r\\nhis attentions to no one in particular; the scorpion kept grabbing at\\r\\ntheir legs with his huge pincers; a three-foot centipede kept screwing\\r\\nup their bodies, nipping as he went; varied as numerous were their\\r\\nwoes.  Nor was it long before the last of them had fled from the\\r\\nkitchen to the sculleries.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut thither also they were followed, and there again they were hunted\\r\\nabout.  They were bespattered with the dirt of their own neglect; they\\r\\nwere soused in the stinking water that had boiled greens; they were\\r\\nsmeared with rancid dripping; their faces were rubbed in maggots: I\\r\\ndare not tell all that was done to them.  At last they got the door\\r\\ninto a back yard open, and rushed out.  Then first they knew that the\\r\\nwind was howling and the rain falling in sheets.  But there was no rest\\r\\nfor them even there.  Thither also were they followed by the inexorable\\r\\navengers, and the only door here was a door out of the palace: out\\r\\nevery soul of them was driven, and left, some standing, some lying,\\r\\nsome crawling, to the farther buffeting of the waterspouts and\\r\\nwhirlwinds ranging every street of the city.  The door was flung to\\r\\nbehind them, and they heard it locked and bolted and barred against\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap27\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 27\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nMore Vengeance\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs soon as they were gone, Curdie brought the creatures back to the\\r\\nservants\\' hall, and told them to eat up everything on the table. It was\\r\\na sight to see them all standing round it\\xe2\\x80\\x94except such as had to get\\r\\nupon it\\xe2\\x80\\x94eating and drinking, each after its fashion, without a smile,\\r\\nor a word, or a glance of fellowship in the act. A very few moments\\r\\nserved to make everything eatable vanish, and then Curdie requested\\r\\nthem to clean house, and the page who stood by to assist them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEvery one set about it except Ballbody: he could do nothing at\\r\\ncleaning, for the more he rolled, the more he spread the dirt. Curdie\\r\\nwas curious to know what he had been, and how he had come to be such as\\r\\nhe was: but he could only conjecture that he was a gluttonous alderman\\r\\nwhom nature had treated homeopathically. And now there was such a\\r\\ncleaning and clearing out of neglected places, such a burying and\\r\\nburning of refuse, such a rinsing of jugs, such a swilling of sinks,\\r\\nand such a flushing of drains as would have delighted the eyes of all\\r\\ntrue housekeepers and lovers of cleanliness generally.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie meantime was with the king, telling him all he had done. They\\r\\nhad heard a little noise, but not much, for he had told the avengers to\\r\\nrepress outcry as much as possible; and they had seen to it that the\\r\\nmore anyone cried out the more he had to cry out upon, while the\\r\\npatient ones they scarcely hurt at all.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHaving promised His Majesty and Her Royal Highness a good breakfast,\\r\\nCurdie now went to finish the business.  The courtiers must be dealt\\r\\nwith.  A few who were the worst, and the leaders of the rest, must be\\r\\nmade examples of; the others should be driven to the street.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe found the chiefs of the conspiracy holding a final consultation in\\r\\nthe smaller room off the hall.  These were the lord chamberlain, the\\r\\nattorney-general, the master of the horse, and the king\\'s private\\r\\nsecretary: the lord chancellor and the rest, as foolish as faithless,\\r\\nwere but the tools of these.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe housemaid had shown him a little closet, opening from a passage\\r\\nbehind, where he could overhear all that passed in that room; and now\\r\\nCurdie heard enough to understand that they had determined, in the dead\\r\\nof that night, rather in the deepest dark before the morning, to bring\\r\\na certain company of soldiers into the palace, make away with the king,\\r\\nsecure the princess, announce the sudden death of His Majesty, read as\\r\\nhis the will they had drawn up, and proceed to govern the country at\\r\\ntheir ease, and with results: they would at once levy severer taxes,\\r\\nand pick a quarrel with the most powerful of their neighbours.\\r\\nEverything settled, they agreed to retire, and have a few hours\\' quiet\\r\\nsleep first\\xe2\\x80\\x94all but the secretary, who was to sit up and call them at\\r\\nthe proper moment. Curdie allowed them half an hour to get to bed, and\\r\\nthen set about completing his purgation of the palace.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFirst he called Lina, and opened the door of the room where the\\r\\nsecretary sat.  She crept in, and laid herself down against it. When\\r\\nthe secretary, rising to stretch his legs, caught sight of her eyes, he\\r\\nstood frozen with terror.  She made neither motion nor sound.\\r\\nGathering courage, and taking the thing for a spectral illusion, he\\r\\nmade a step forward.  She showed her other teeth, with a growl neither\\r\\nmore than audible nor less than horrible.  The secretary sank fainting\\r\\ninto a chair.  He was not a brave man, and besides, his conscience had\\r\\ngone over to the enemy, and was sitting against the door by Lina.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTo the lord chamberlain\\'s door next, Curdie conducted the legserpent,\\r\\nand let him in.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow His Lordship had had a bedstead made for himself, sweetly fashioned\\r\\nof rods of silver gilt: upon it the legserpent found him asleep, and\\r\\nunder it he crept.  But out he came on the other side, and crept over\\r\\nit next, and again under it, and so over it, under it, over it, five or\\r\\nsix times, every time leaving a coil of himself behind him, until he\\r\\nhad softly folded all his length about the lord chamberlain and his\\r\\nbed.  This done, he set up his head, looking down with curved neck\\r\\nright over His Lordship\\'s, and began to hiss in his face.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe woke in terror unspeakable, and would have started up but the moment\\r\\nhe moved, the legserpent drew his coils closer, and closer still, and\\r\\ndrew and drew until the quaking traitor heard the joints of his\\r\\nbedstead grinding and gnarring.  Presently he persuaded himself that it\\r\\nwas only a horrid nightmare, and began to struggle with all his\\r\\nstrength to throw it off.  Thereupon the legserpent gave his hooked\\r\\nnose such a bite that his teeth met through it\\xe2\\x80\\x94but it was hardly\\r\\nthicker than the bowl of a spoon; and then the vulture knew that he was\\r\\nin the grasp of his enemy the snake, and yielded.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs soon as he was quiet the legserpent began to untwist and retwist, to\\r\\nuncoil and recoil himself, swinging and swaying, knotting and relaxing\\r\\nhimself with strangest curves and convolutions, always, however,\\r\\nleaving at least one coil around his victim.  At last he undid himself\\r\\nentirely, and crept from the bed. Then first the lord chamberlain\\r\\ndiscovered that his tormentor had bent and twisted the bedstead, legs\\r\\nand canopy and all, so about him that he was shut in a silver cage out\\r\\nof which it was impossible for him to find a way.  Once more, thinking\\r\\nhis enemy was gone, he began to shout for help.  But the instant he\\r\\nopened his mouth his keeper darted at him and bit him, and after three\\r\\nor four such essays, he lay still.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe master of the horse Curdie gave in charge to the tapir.  When the\\r\\nsoldier saw him enter\\xe2\\x80\\x94for he was not yet asleep\\xe2\\x80\\x94he sprang from his\\r\\nbed, and flew at him with his sword.  But the creature\\'s hide was\\r\\ninvulnerable to his blows, and he pecked at his legs with his proboscis\\r\\nuntil he jumped into bed again, groaning, and covered himself up; after\\r\\nwhich the tapir contented himself with now and then paying a visit to\\r\\nhis toes.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs for the attorney-general, Curdie led to his door a huge spider,\\r\\nabout two feet long in the body, which, having made an excellent\\r\\nsupper, was full of webbing.  The attorney-general had not gone to bed,\\r\\nbut sat in a chair asleep before a great mirror.  He had been trying\\r\\nthe effect of a diamond star which he had that morning taken from the\\r\\njewel room.  When he woke he fancied himself paralysed; every limb,\\r\\nevery finger even, was motionless: coils and coils of broad spider\\r\\nribbon bandaged his members to his body, and all to the chair.  In the\\r\\nglass he saw himself wound about with slavery infinite.  On a footstool\\r\\na yard off sat the spider glaring at him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nClubhead had mounted guard over the butler, where he lay tied hand and\\r\\nfoot under the third cask.  From that cask he had seen the wine run\\r\\ninto a great bath, and therein he expected to be drowned.  The doctor,\\r\\nwith his crushed leg, needed no one to guard him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd now Curdie proceeded to the expulsion of the rest.  Great men or\\r\\nunderlings, he treated them all alike.  From room to room over the\\r\\nhouse he went, and sleeping or waking took the man by the hand. Such\\r\\nwas the state to which a year of wicked rule had reduced the moral\\r\\ncondition of the court, that in it all he found but three with human\\r\\nhands.  The possessors of these he allowed to dress themselves and\\r\\ndepart in peace.  When they perceived his mission, and how he was\\r\\nbacked, they yielded.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen commenced a general hunt, to clear the house of the vermin. Out of\\r\\ntheir beds in their night clothing, out of their rooms, gorgeous\\r\\nchambers or garret nooks, the creatures hunted them.  Not one was\\r\\nallowed to escape.  Tumult and noise there was little, for fear was too\\r\\ndeadly for outcry.  Ferreting them out everywhere, following them\\r\\nupstairs and downstairs, yielding no instant of repose except upon the\\r\\nway out, the avengers persecuted the miscreants, until the last of them\\r\\nwas shivering outside the palace gates, with hardly sense enough left\\r\\nto know where to turn.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen they set out to look for shelter, they found every inn full of the\\r\\nservants expelled before them, and not one would yield his place to a\\r\\nsuperior suddenly levelled with himself.  Most houses refused to admit\\r\\nthem on the ground of the wickedness that must have drawn on them such\\r\\na punishment; and not a few would have been left in the streets all\\r\\nnight, had not Derba, roused by the vain entreaties at the doors on\\r\\neach side of her cottage, opened hers, and given up everything to them.\\r\\nThe lord chancellor was only too glad to share a mattress with a\\r\\nstableboy, and steal his bare feet under his jacket.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the morning Curdie appeared, and the outcasts were in terror,\\r\\nthinking he had come after them again.  But he took no notice of them:\\r\\nhis object was to request Derba to go to the palace: the king required\\r\\nher services.  She need take no trouble about her cottage, he said; the\\r\\npalace was henceforward her home: she was the king\\'s chatelaine over\\r\\nmen and maidens of his household.  And this very morning she must cook\\r\\nHis Majesty a nice breakfast.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap28\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 28\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nThe Preacher\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nVarious reports went undulating through the city as to the nature of\\r\\nwhat had taken place in the palace.  The people gathered, and stared at\\r\\nthe house, eyeing it as if it had sprung up in the night. But it looked\\r\\nsedate enough, remaining closed and silent, like a house that was dead.\\r\\nThey saw no one come out or go in.  Smoke arose from a chimney or two;\\r\\nthere was hardly another sign of life. It was not for some little time\\r\\ngenerally understood that the highest officers of the crown as well as\\r\\nthe lowest menials of the palace had been dismissed in disgrace: for\\r\\nwho was to recognize a lord chancellor in his nightshirt?  And what\\r\\nlord chancellor would, so attired in the street, proclaim his rank and\\r\\noffice aloud? Before it was day most of the courtiers crept down to the\\r\\nriver, hired boats, and betook themselves to their homes or their\\r\\nfriends in the country.  It was assumed in the city that the domestics\\r\\nhad been discharged upon a sudden discovery of general and unpardonable\\r\\npeculation; for, almost everybody being guilty of it himself, petty\\r\\ndishonesty was the crime most easily credited and least easily passed\\r\\nover in Gwyntystorm.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow that same day was Religion day, and not a few of the clergy, always\\r\\nglad to seize on any passing event to give interest to the dull and\\r\\nmonotonic grind of their intellectual machines, made this remarkable\\r\\none the ground of discourse to their congregations. More especially\\r\\nthan the rest, the first priest of the great temple where was the royal\\r\\npew, judged himself, from his relation to the palace, called upon to\\r\\n\\'improve the occasion\\', for they talked ever about improvement at\\r\\nGwyntystorm, all the time they were going down hill with a rush.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe book which had, of late years, come to be considered the most\\r\\nsacred, was called The Book of Nations, and consisted of proverbs, and\\r\\nhistory traced through custom: from it the first priest chose his text;\\r\\nand his text was, \\'Honesty Is the Best Policy.\\'  He was considered a\\r\\nvery eloquent man, but I can offer only a few of the larger bones of\\r\\nhis sermon.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe main proof of the verity of their religion, he said, was that\\r\\nthings always went well with those who profess it; and its first\\r\\nfundamental principle, grounded in inborn invariable instinct, was,\\r\\nthat every One should take care of that One.  This was the first duty\\r\\nof Man.  If every one would but obey this law, number one, then would\\r\\nevery one be perfectly cared for\\xe2\\x80\\x94one being always equal to one.  But\\r\\nthe faculty of care was in excess of need, and all that overflowed, and\\r\\nwould otherwise run to waste, ought to be gently turned in the\\r\\ndirection of one\\'s neighbour, seeing that this also wrought for the\\r\\nfulfilling of the law, inasmuch as the reaction of excess so directed\\r\\nwas upon the director of the same, to the comfort, that is, and\\r\\nwell-being of the original self.  To be just and friendly was to build\\r\\nthe warmest and safest of all nests, and to be kind and loving was to\\r\\nline it with the softest of all furs and feathers, for the one\\r\\nprecious, comfort-loving self there to lie, revelling in downiest\\r\\nbliss.  One of the laws therefore most binding upon men because of its\\r\\nrelation to the first and greatest of all duties, was embodied in the\\r\\nProverb he had just read; and what stronger proof of its wisdom and\\r\\ntruth could they desire than the sudden and complete vengeance which\\r\\nhad fallen upon those worse than ordinary sinners who had offended\\r\\nagainst the king\\'s majesty by forgetting that \\'Honesty Is the Best\\r\\nPolicy\\'?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt this point of the discourse the head of the legserpent rose from the\\r\\nfloor of the temple, towering above the pulpit, above the priest, then\\r\\ncurving downward, with open mouth slowly descended upon him.  Horror\\r\\nfroze the sermon-pump.  He stared upward aghast. The great teeth of the\\r\\nanimal closed upon a mouthful of the sacred vestments, and slowly he\\r\\nlifted the preacher from the pulpit, like a handful of linen from a\\r\\nwashtub, and, on his four solemn stumps, bore him out of the temple,\\r\\ndangling aloft from his jaws.  At the back of it he dropped him into\\r\\nthe dust hole among the remnants of a library whose age had destroyed\\r\\nits value in the eyes of the chapter.  They found him burrowing in it,\\r\\na lunatic henceforth\\xe2\\x80\\x94whose madness presented the peculiar feature,\\r\\nthat in its paroxysms he jabbered sense.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBone-freezing horror pervaded Gwyntystorm.  If their best and wisest\\r\\nwere treated with such contempt, what might not the rest of them look\\r\\nfor?  Alas for their city!  Their grandly respectable city!  Their\\r\\nloftily reasonable city!  Where it was all to end, who could tell!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut something must be done.  Hastily assembling, the priests chose a\\r\\nnew first priest, and in full conclave unanimously declared and\\r\\naccepted that the king in his retirement had, through the practice of\\r\\nthe blackest magic, turned the palace into a nest of demons in the\\r\\nmidst of them.  A grand exorcism was therefore indispensable.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the meantime the fact came out that the greater part of the\\r\\ncourtiers had been dismissed as well as the servants, and this fact\\r\\nswelled the hope of the Party of Decency, as they called themselves.\\r\\nUpon it they proceeded to act, and strengthened themselves on all sides.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe action of the king\\'s bodyguard remained for a time uncertain. But\\r\\nwhen at length its officers were satisfied that both the master of the\\r\\nhorse and their colonel were missing, they placed themselves under the\\r\\norders of the first priest.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEvery one dated the culmination of the evil from the visit of the miner\\r\\nand his mongrel; and the butchers vowed, if they could but get hold of\\r\\nthem again, they would roast both of them alive.  At once they formed\\r\\nthemselves into a regiment, and put their dogs in training for attack.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIncessant was the talk, innumerable were the suggestions, and great was\\r\\nthe deliberation.  The general consent, however, was that as soon as\\r\\nthe priests should have expelled the demons, they would depose the\\r\\nking, and attired in all his regal insignia, shut him in a cage for\\r\\npublic show; then choose governors, with the lord chancellor at their\\r\\nhead, whose first duty should be to remit every possible tax; and the\\r\\nmagistrates, by the mouth of the city marshal, required all able-bodied\\r\\ncitizens, in order to do their part toward the carrying out of these\\r\\nand a multitude of other reforms, to be ready to take arms at the first\\r\\nsummons.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThings needful were prepared as speedily as possible, and a mighty\\r\\nceremony, in the temple, in the market place, and in front of the\\r\\npalace, was performed for the expulsion of the demons.  This over, the\\r\\nleaders retired to arrange an attack upon the palace.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut that night events occurred which, proving the failure of their\\r\\nfirst, induced the abandonment of their second, intent.  Certain of the\\r\\nprowling order of the community, whose numbers had of late been\\r\\nsteadily on the increase, reported frightful things.  Demons of\\r\\nindescribable ugliness had been espied careering through the midnight\\r\\nstreets and courts.  A citizen\\xe2\\x80\\x94some said in the very act of\\r\\nhousebreaking, but no one cared to look into trifles at such a\\r\\ncrisis\\xe2\\x80\\x94had been seized from behind, he could not see by what, and\\r\\nsoused in the river.  A well-known receiver of stolen goods had had his\\r\\nshop broken open, and when he came down in the morning had found\\r\\neverything in ruin on the pavement.  The wooden image of justice over\\r\\nthe door of the city marshal had had the arm that held the sword bitten\\r\\noff.  The gluttonous magistrate had been pulled from his bed in the\\r\\ndark, by beings of which he could see nothing but the flaming eyes, and\\r\\ntreated to a bath of the turtle soup that had been left simmering by\\r\\nthe side of the kitchen fire.  Having poured it over him, they put him\\r\\nagain into his bed, where he soon learned how a mummy must feel in its\\r\\ncerements.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWorst of all, in the market place was fixed up a paper, with the king\\'s\\r\\nown signature, to the effect that whoever henceforth should show\\r\\ninhospitality to strangers, and should be convicted of the same, should\\r\\nbe instantly expelled the city; while a second, in the butchers\\'\\r\\nquarter, ordained that any dog which henceforth should attack a\\r\\nstranger should be immediately destroyed.  It was plain, said the\\r\\nbutchers, that the clergy were of no use; they could not exorcise\\r\\ndemons!  That afternoon, catching sight of a poor old fellow in rags\\r\\nand tatters, quietly walking up the street, they hounded their dogs\\r\\nupon him, and had it not been that the door of Derba\\'s cottage was\\r\\nstanding open, and was near enough for him to dart in and shut it ere\\r\\nthey reached him, he would have been torn in pieces.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd thus things went on for some days.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap29\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 29\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nBarbara\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the meantime, with Derba to minister to his wants, with Curdie to\\r\\nprotect him, and Irene to nurse him, the king was getting rapidly\\r\\nstronger.  Good food was what he most wanted and of that, at least of\\r\\ncertain kinds of it, there was plentiful store in the palace.\\r\\nEverywhere since the cleansing of the lower regions of it, the air was\\r\\nclean and sweet, and under the honest hands of the one housemaid the\\r\\nking\\'s chamber became a pleasure to his eyes.  With such changes it was\\r\\nno wonder if his heart grew lighter as well as his brain clearer.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut still evil dreams came and troubled him, the lingering result of\\r\\nthe wicked medicines the doctor had given him.  Every night, sometimes\\r\\ntwice or thrice, he would wake up in terror, and it would be minutes\\r\\nere he could come to himself.  The consequence was that he was always\\r\\nworse in the morning, and had loss to make up during the day.  While he\\r\\nslept, Irene or Curdie, one or the other, must still be always by his\\r\\nside.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOne night, when it was Curdie\\'s turn with the king, he heard a cry\\r\\nsomewhere in the house, and as there was no other child, concluded,\\r\\nnotwithstanding the distance of her grandmother\\'s room, that it must be\\r\\nBarbara.  Fearing something might be wrong, and noting the king\\'s sleep\\r\\nmore quiet than usual, he ran to see.  He found the child in the middle\\r\\nof the floor, weeping bitterly, and Derba slumbering peacefully in bed.\\r\\nThe instant she saw him the night-lost thing ceased her crying, smiled,\\r\\nand stretched out her arms to him.  Unwilling to wake the old woman,\\r\\nwho had been working hard all day, he took the child, and carried her\\r\\nwith him.  She clung to him so, pressing her tear-wet radiant face\\r\\nagainst his, that her little arms threatened to choke him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen he re-entered the chamber, he found the king sitting up in bed,\\r\\nfighting the phantoms of some hideous dream.  Generally upon such\\r\\noccasions, although he saw his watcher, he could not dissociate him\\r\\nfrom the dream, and went raving on.  But the moment his eyes fell upon\\r\\nlittle Barbara, whom he had never seen before, his soul came into them\\r\\nwith a rush, and a smile like the dawn of an eternal day overspread his\\r\\ncountenance; the dream was nowhere, and the child was in his heart.  He\\r\\nstretched out his arms to her, the child stretched out hers to him, and\\r\\nin five minutes they were both asleep, each in the other\\'s embrace.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFrom that night Barbara had a crib in the king\\'s chamber, and as often\\r\\nas he woke, Irene or Curdie, whichever was watching, took the sleeping\\r\\nchild and laid her in his arms, upon which, invariably and instantly,\\r\\nthe dream would vanish.  A great part of the day too she would be\\r\\nplaying on or about the king\\'s bed; and it was a delight to the heart\\r\\nof the princess to see her amusing herself with the crown, now sitting\\r\\nupon it, now rolling it hither and thither about the room like a hoop.\\r\\nHer grandmother entering once while she was pretending to make porridge\\r\\nin it, held up her hands in horror-struck amazement; but the king would\\r\\nnot allow her to interfere, for the king was now Barbara\\'s playmate,\\r\\nand his crown their plaything.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe colonel of the guard also was growing better.  Curdie went often to\\r\\nsee him.  They were soon friends, for the best people understand each\\r\\nother the easiest, and the grim old warrior loved the miner boy as if\\r\\nhe were at once his son and his angel.  He was very anxious about his\\r\\nregiment.  He said the officers were mostly honest men, he believed,\\r\\nbut how they might be doing without him, or what they might resolve, in\\r\\nignorance of the real state of affairs, and exposed to every\\r\\nmisrepresentation, who could tell? Curdie proposed that he should send\\r\\nfor the major, offering to be the messenger.  The colonel agreed, and\\r\\nCurdie went\\xe2\\x80\\x94not without his mattock, because of the dogs.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut the officers had been told by the master of the horse that their\\r\\ncolonel was dead, and although they were amazed he should be buried\\r\\nwithout the attendance of his regiment, they never doubted the\\r\\ninformation.  The handwriting itself of their colonel was insufficient,\\r\\ncounteracted by the fresh reports daily current, to destroy the lie.\\r\\nThe major regarded the letter as a trap for the next officer in\\r\\ncommand, and sent his orderly to arrest the messenger.  But Curdie had\\r\\nhad the wisdom not to wait for an answer.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe king\\'s enemies said that he had first poisoned the good colonel of\\r\\nthe guard, and then murdered the master of the horse, and other\\r\\nfaithful councillors; and that his oldest and most attached domestics\\r\\nhad but escaped from the palace with their lives\\xe2\\x80\\x94not all of them, for\\r\\nthe butler was missing.  Mad or wicked, he was not only unfit to rule\\r\\nany longer, but worse than unfit to have in his power and under his\\r\\ninfluence the young princess, only hope of Gwyntystorm and the kingdom.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe moment the lord chancellor reached his house in the country and had\\r\\ngot himself clothed, he began to devise how yet to destroy his master;\\r\\nand the very next morning set out for the neighbouring kingdom of\\r\\nBorsagrass to invite invasion, and offer a compact with its monarch.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap30\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 30\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nPeter\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt the cottage in the mountain everything for a time went on just as\\r\\nbefore.  It was indeed dull without Curdie, but as often as they looked\\r\\nat the emerald it was gloriously green, and with nothing to fear or\\r\\nregret, and everything to hope, they required little comforting.  One\\r\\nmorning, however, at last, Peter, who had been consulting the gem,\\r\\nrather now from habit than anxiety, as a farmer his barometer in\\r\\nundoubtful weather, turned suddenly to his wife, the stone in his hand,\\r\\nand held it up with a look of ghastly dismay.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Why, that\\'s never the emerald!\\' said Joan.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'It is,\\' answered Peter; \\'but it were small blame to any one that took\\r\\nit for a bit of bottle glass!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor, all save one spot right in the centre, of intensest and most\\r\\nbrilliant green, it looked as if the colour had been burnt out of it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Run, run, Peter!\\' cried his wife.  \\'Run and tell the old princess.  It\\r\\nmay not be too late.  The boy must be lying at death\\'s door.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWithout a word Peter caught up his mattock, darted from the cottage,\\r\\nand was at the bottom of the hill in less time than he usually took to\\r\\nget halfway.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe door of the king\\'s house stood open; he rushed in and up the stair.\\r\\nBut after wandering about in vain for an hour, opening door after door,\\r\\nand finding no way farther up, the heart of the old man had well-nigh\\r\\nfailed him.  Empty rooms, empty rooms!\\xe2\\x80\\x94desertion and desolation\\r\\neverywhere.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt last he did come upon the door to the tower stair.  Up he darted.\\r\\nArrived at the top, he found three doors, and, one after the other,\\r\\nknocked at them all.  But there was neither voice nor hearing.  Urged\\r\\nby his faith and his dread, slowly, hesitatingly, he opened one.  It\\r\\nrevealed a bare garret room, nothing in it but one chair and one\\r\\nspinning wheel.  He closed it, and opened the next\\xe2\\x80\\x94to start back in\\r\\nterror, for he saw nothing but a great gulf, a moonless night, full of\\r\\nstars, and, for all the stars, dark, dark!\\xe2\\x80\\x94a fathomless abyss.  He\\r\\nopened the third door, and a rush like the tide of a living sea invaded\\r\\nhis ears.  Multitudinous wings flapped and flashed in the sun, and,\\r\\nlike the ascending column from a volcano, white birds innumerable shot\\r\\ninto the air, darkening the day with the shadow of their cloud, and\\r\\nthen, with a sharp sweep, as if bent sideways by a sudden wind, flew\\r\\nnorthward, swiftly away, and vanished.  The place felt like a tomb.\\r\\nThere seemed no breath of life left in it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDespair laid hold upon him; he rushed down thundering with heavy feet.\\r\\nOut upon him darted the housekeeper like an ogress-spider, and after\\r\\nher came her men; but Peter rushed past them, heedless and\\r\\ncareless\\xe2\\x80\\x94for had not the princess mocked him?\\xe2\\x80\\x94and sped along the road\\r\\nto Gwyntystorm.  What help lay in a miner\\'s mattock, a man\\'s arm, a\\r\\nfather\\'s heart, he would bear to his boy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nJoan sat up all night waiting his return, hoping and hoping.  The\\r\\nmountain was very still, and the sky was clear; but all night long the\\r\\nminer sped northward, and the heart of his wife was troubled.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap31\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 31\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nThe Sacrifice\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThings in the palace were in a strange condition: the king playing with\\r\\na child and dreaming wise dreams, waited upon by a little princess with\\r\\nthe heart of a queen, and a youth from the mines, who went nowhere, not\\r\\neven into the king\\'s chamber, without his mattock on his shoulder and a\\r\\nhorrible animal at his heels; in a room nearby the colonel of his\\r\\nguard, also in bed, without a soldier to obey him; in six other rooms,\\r\\nfar apart, six miscreants, each watched by a beast-jailer; ministers to\\r\\nthem all, an old woman and a page; and in the wine cellar, forty-three\\r\\nanimals, creatures more grotesque than ever brain of man invented.\\r\\nNone dared approach its gates, and seldom one issued from them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAll the dwellers in the city were united in enmity to the palace. It\\r\\nswarmed with evil spirits, they said, whereas the evil spirits were in\\r\\nthe city, unsuspected.  One consequence of their presence was that,\\r\\nwhen the rumour came that a great army was on the march against\\r\\nGwyntystorm, instead of rushing to their defences, to make new gates,\\r\\nfree portcullises and drawbridges, and bar the river, each band flew\\r\\nfirst to their treasures, burying them in their cellars and gardens,\\r\\nand hiding them behind stones in their chimneys; and, next to\\r\\nrebellion, signing an invitation to His Majesty of Borsagrass to enter\\r\\nat their open gates, destroy their king, and annex their country to his\\r\\nown.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe straits of isolation were soon found in the palace: its invalids\\r\\nwere requiring stronger food, and what was to be done? For if the\\r\\nbutchers sent meat to the palace, was it not likely enough to be\\r\\npoisoned?  Curdie said to Derba he would think of some plan before\\r\\nmorning.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut that same night, as soon as it was dark, Lina came to her master,\\r\\nand let him understand she wanted to go out.  He unlocked a little\\r\\nprivate postern for her, left it so that she could push it open when\\r\\nshe returned, and told the crocodile to stretch himself across it\\r\\ninside.  Before midnight she came back with a young deer.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEarly the next morning the legserpent crept out of the wine cellar,\\r\\nthrough the broken door behind, shot into the river, and soon appeared\\r\\nin the kitchen with a splendid sturgeon.  Every night Lina went out\\r\\nhunting, and every morning Legserpent went out fishing, and both\\r\\ninvalids and household had plenty to eat.  As to news, the page, in\\r\\nplain clothes, would now and then venture out into the market place,\\r\\nand gather some.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOne night he came back with the report that the army of the king of\\r\\nBorsagrass had crossed the border.  Two days after, he brought the news\\r\\nthat the enemy was now but twenty miles from Gwyntystorm.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe colonel of the guard rose, and began furbishing his armour\\xe2\\x80\\x94but\\r\\ngave it over to the page, and staggered across to the barracks, which\\r\\nwere in the next street.  The sentry took him for a ghost or worse, ran\\r\\ninto the guardroom, bolted the door, and stopped his ears.  The poor\\r\\ncolonel, who was yet hardly able to stand, crawled back despairing.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor Curdie, he had already, as soon as the first rumour reached him,\\r\\nresolved, if no other instructions came, and the king continued unable\\r\\nto give orders, to call Lina and the creatures, and march to meet the\\r\\nenemy.  If he died, he died for the right, and there was a right end of\\r\\nit.  He had no preparations to make, except a good sleep.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe asked the king to let the housemaid take his place by His Majesty\\r\\nthat night, and went and lay down on the floor of the corridor, no\\r\\nfarther off than a whisper would reach from the door of the chamber.\\r\\nThere, with an old mantle of the king\\'s thrown over him, he was soon\\r\\nfast asleep.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSomewhere about the middle of the night, he woke suddenly, started to\\r\\nhis feet, and rubbed his eyes.  He could not tell what had waked him.\\r\\nBut could he be awake, or was he not dreaming?  The curtain of the\\r\\nking\\'s door, a dull red ever before, was glowing a gorgeous, a radiant\\r\\npurple; and the crown wrought upon it in silks and gems was flashing as\\r\\nif it burned!  What could it mean?  Was the king\\'s chamber on fire?  He\\r\\ndarted to the door and lifted the curtain. Glorious terrible sight!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA long and broad marble table, that stood at one end of the room, had\\r\\nbeen drawn into the middle of it, and thereon burned a great fire, of a\\r\\nsort that Curdie knew\\xe2\\x80\\x94a fire of glowing, flaming roses, red and white.\\r\\nIn the midst of the roses lay the king, moaning, but motionless.  Every\\r\\nrose that fell from the table to the floor, someone, whom Curdie could\\r\\nnot plainly see for the brightness, lifted and laid burning upon the\\r\\nking\\'s face, until at length his face too was covered with the live\\r\\nroses, and he lay all within the fire, moaning still, with now and then\\r\\na shuddering sob.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd the shape that Curdie saw and could not see, wept over the king as\\r\\nhe lay in the fire, and often she hid her face in handfuls of her\\r\\nshadowy hair, and from her hair the water of her weeping dropped like\\r\\nsunset rain in the light of the roses.  At last she lifted a great\\r\\narmful of her hair, and shook it over the fire, and the drops fell from\\r\\nit in showers, and they did not hiss in the flames, but there arose\\r\\ninstead as it were the sound of running brooks.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd the glow of the red fire died away, and the glow of the white fire\\r\\ngrew grey, and the light was gone, and on the table all was\\r\\nblack\\xe2\\x80\\x94except the face of the king, which shone from under the burnt\\r\\nroses like a diamond in the ashes of a furnace.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen Curdie, no longer dazzled, saw and knew the old princess.  The\\r\\nroom was lighted with the splendour of her face, of her blue eyes, of\\r\\nher sapphire crown.  Her golden hair went streaming out from her\\r\\nthrough the air till it went off in mist and light.  She was large and\\r\\nstrong as a Titaness.  She stooped over the table-altar, put her mighty\\r\\narms under the living sacrifice, lifted the king, as if he were but a\\r\\nlittle child, to her bosom, walked with him up the floor, and laid him\\r\\nin his bed.  Then darkness fell.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe miner boy turned silent away, and laid himself down again in the\\r\\ncorridor.  An absolute joy filled his heart, his bosom, his head, his\\r\\nwhole body.  All was safe; all was well.  With the helve of his mattock\\r\\ntight in his grasp, he sank into a dreamless sleep.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap32\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 32\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nThe King\\'s Army\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe woke like a giant refreshed with wine.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen he went into the king\\'s chamber, the housemaid sat where he had\\r\\nleft her, and everything in the room was as it had been the night\\r\\nbefore, save that a heavenly odour of roses filled the air of it.  He\\r\\nwent up to the bed.  The king opened his eyes, and the soul of perfect\\r\\nhealth shone out of them.  Nor was Curdie amazed in his delight.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Is it not time to rise, Curdie?\\' said the king.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'It is, Your Majesty.  Today we must be doing,\\' answered Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'What must we be doing today, Curdie?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Fighting, sire.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Then fetch me my armour\\xe2\\x80\\x94that of plated steel, in the chest there.\\r\\nYou will find the underclothing with it.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs he spoke, he reached out his hand for his sword, which hung in the\\r\\nbed before him, drew it, and examined the blade.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'A little rusty!\\' he said, \\'but the edge is there.  We shall polish it\\r\\nourselves today\\xe2\\x80\\x94not on the wheel.  Curdie, my son, I wake from a\\r\\ntroubled dream.  A glorious torture has ended it, and I live.  I know\\r\\nnow well how things are, but you shall explain them to me as I get on\\r\\nmy armour.  No, I need no bath.  I am clean.  Call the colonel of the\\r\\nguard.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn complete steel the old man stepped into the chamber.  He knew it\\r\\nnot, but the old princess had passed through his room in the night.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Why, Sir Bronzebeard!\\' said the king, \\'you are dressed before me! You\\r\\nneed no valet, old man, when there is battle in the wind!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Battle, sire!\\' returned the colonel.  \\'Where then are our soldiers?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Why, there and here,\\' answered the king, pointing to the colonel\\r\\nfirst, and then to himself.  \\'Where else, man?  The enemy will be upon\\r\\nus ere sunset, if we be not upon him ere noon.  What other thing was in\\r\\nyour brave brain when you donned your armour, friend?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Your Majesty\\'s orders, sire,\\' answered Sir Bronzebeard.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe king smiled and turned to Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'And what was in yours, Curdie, for your first word was of battle?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'See, Your Majesty,\\' answered Curdie; \\'I have polished my mattock. If\\r\\nYour Majesty had not taken the command, I would have met the enemy at\\r\\nthe head of my beasts, and died in comfort, or done better.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Brave boy!\\' said the king.  \\'He who takes his life in his hand is the\\r\\nonly soldier.

Can you find me a\\r\\nhorse, think you, Sir Bronzebeard?  Alas! they told me my white charger\\r\\nwas dead.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I will go and fright the varletry with my presence, and secure, I\\r\\ntrust, a horse for Your Majesty, and one for myself.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'And look you, brother!\\' said the king; \\'bring one for my miner boy\\r\\ntoo, and a sober old charger for the princess, for she too must go to\\r\\nthe battle, and conquer with us.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Pardon me, sire,\\' said Curdie; \\'a miner can fight best on foot. I\\r\\nmight smite my horse dead under me with a missed blow.  And besides\\r\\nthat, I must be near to my beasts.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'As you will,\\' said the king.  \\'Three horses then, Sir Bronzebeard.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe colonel departed, doubting sorely in his heart how to accoutre and\\r\\nlead from the barrack stables three horses, in the teeth of his\\r\\nrevolted regiment.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the hall he met the housemaid.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Can you lead a horse?\\' he asked.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Yes, sir.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Are you willing to die for the king?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Yes, sir.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Can you do as you are bid?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I can keep on trying, sir.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Come then.  Were I not a man I would be a woman such as you.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen they entered the barrack yard, the soldiers scattered like autumn\\r\\nleaves before a blast of winter.  They went into the stable\\r\\nunchallenged\\xe2\\x80\\x94and lo! in a stall, before the colonel\\'s eyes, stood the\\r\\nking\\'s white charger, with the royal saddle and bridle hung high beside\\r\\nhim!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Traitorous thieves!\\' muttered the old man in his beard, and went along\\r\\nthe stalls, looking for his own black charger.  Having found him, he\\r\\nreturned to saddle first the king\\'s.  But the maid had already the\\r\\nsaddle upon him, and so girt that the colonel could thrust no finger\\r\\ntip between girth and skin.  He left her to finish what she had so well\\r\\nbegun, and went and made ready his own.  He then chose for the princess\\r\\na great red horse, twenty years old, which he knew to possess every\\r\\nequine virtue.  This and his own he led to the palace, and the maid led\\r\\nthe king\\'s.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe king and Curdie stood in the court, the king in full armour of\\r\\nsilvered steel, with a circlet of rubies and diamonds round his helmet.\\r\\nHe almost leaped for joy when he saw his great white charger come in,\\r\\ngentle as a child to the hand of the housemaid. But when the horse saw\\r\\nhis master in his armour, he reared and bounded in jubilation, yet did\\r\\nnot break from the hand that held him.  Then out came the princess\\r\\nattired and ready, with a hunting knife her father had given her by her\\r\\nside.  They brought her mother\\'s saddle, splendent with gems and gold,\\r\\nset it on the great red horse, and lifted her to it.  But the saddle\\r\\nwas so big, and the horse so tall, that the child found no comfort in\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Please, King Papa,\\' she said, \\'can I not have my white pony?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I did not think of him, little one,\\' said the king.  \\'Where is he?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'In the stable,\\' answered the maid.  \\'I found him half starved, the\\r\\nonly horse within the gates, the day after the servants were driven\\r\\nout.  He has been well fed since.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Go and fetch him,\\' said the king.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs the maid appeared with the pony, from a side door came Lina and the\\r\\nforty-nine, following Curdie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I will go with Curdie and the Uglies,\\' cried the princess; and as soon\\r\\nas she was mounted she got into the middle of the pack.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo out they set, the strangest force that ever went against an enemy.\\r\\nThe king in silver armour sat stately on his white steed, with the\\r\\nstones flashing on his helmet; beside him the grim old colonel, armed\\r\\nin steel, rode his black charger; behind the king, a little to the\\r\\nright, Curdie walked afoot, his mattock shining in the sun; Lina\\r\\nfollowed at his heel; behind her came the wonderful company of Uglies;\\r\\nin the midst of them rode the gracious little Irene, dressed in blue,\\r\\nand mounted on the prettiest of white ponies; behind the colonel, a\\r\\nlittle to the left, walked the page, armed in a breastplate, headpiece,\\r\\nand trooper\\'s sword he had found in the palace, all much too big for\\r\\nhim, and carrying a huge brass trumpet which he did his best to blow;\\r\\nand the king smiled and seemed pleased with his music, although it was\\r\\nbut the grunt of a brazen unrest.  Alongside the beasts walked Derba\\r\\ncarrying Barbara\\xe2\\x80\\x94their refuge the mountains, should the cause of the\\r\\nking be lost; as soon as they were over the river they turned aside to\\r\\nascend the Cliff, and there awaited the forging of the day\\'s history.\\r\\nThen first Curdie saw that the housemaid, whom they had all forgotten,\\r\\nwas following, mounted on the great red horse, and seated in the royal\\r\\nsaddle.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMany were the eyes unfriendly of women that had stared at them from\\r\\ndoor and window as they passed through the city; and low laughter and\\r\\nmockery and evil words from the lips of children had rippled about\\r\\ntheir ears; but the men were all gone to welcome the enemy, the\\r\\nbutchers the first, the king\\'s guard the last.  And now on the heels of\\r\\nthe king\\'s army rushed out the women and children also, to gather\\r\\nflowers and branches, wherewith to welcome their conquerors.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAbout a mile down the river, Curdie, happening to look behind him, saw\\r\\nthe maid, whom he had supposed gone with Derba, still following on the\\r\\ngreat red horse.  The same moment the king, a few paces in front of\\r\\nhim, caught sight of the enemy\\'s tents, pitched where, the cliffs\\r\\nreceding, the bank of the river widened to a little plain.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap33\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 33\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nThe Battle\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe commanded the page to blow his trumpet; and, in the strength of the\\r\\nmoment, the youth uttered a right warlike defiance.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut the butchers and the guard, who had gone over armed to the enemy,\\r\\nthinking that the king had come to make his peace also, and that it\\r\\nmight thereafter go hard with them, rushed at once to make short work\\r\\nwith him, and both secure and commend themselves.  The butchers came on\\r\\nfirst\\xe2\\x80\\x94for the guards had slackened their saddle girths\\xe2\\x80\\x94brandishing\\r\\ntheir knives, and talking to their dogs. Curdie and the page, with Lina\\r\\nand her pack, bounded to meet them. Curdie struck down the foremost\\r\\nwith his mattock.  The page, finding his sword too much for him, threw\\r\\nit away and seized the butcher\\'s knife, which as he rose he plunged\\r\\ninto the foremost dog. Lina rushed raging and gnashing among them.  She\\r\\nwould not look at a dog so long as there was a butcher on his legs, and\\r\\nshe never stopped to kill a butcher, only with one grind of her jaws\\r\\ncrushed a leg of him.  When they were all down, then indeed she flashed\\r\\namong the dogs.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMeantime the king and the colonel had spurred toward the advancing\\r\\nguard.  The king clove the major through skull and collar bone, and the\\r\\ncolonel stabbed the captain in the throat.  Then a fierce combat\\r\\ncommenced\\xe2\\x80\\x94two against many.  But the butchers and their dogs quickly\\r\\ndisposed of, up came Curdie and his beasts.  The horses of the guard,\\r\\nstruck with terror, turned in spite of the spur, and fled in confusion.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThereupon the forces of Borsagrass, which could see little of the\\r\\naffair, but correctly imagined a small determined body in front of\\r\\nthem, hastened to the attack.  No sooner did their first advancing wave\\r\\nappear through the foam of the retreating one, than the king and the\\r\\ncolonel and the page, Curdie and the beasts, went charging upon them.\\r\\nTheir attack, especially the rush of the Uglies, threw the first line\\r\\ninto great confusion, but the second came up quickly; the beasts could\\r\\nnot be everywhere, there were thousands to one against them, and the\\r\\nking and his three companions were in the greatest possible danger.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA dense cloud came over the sun, and sank rapidly toward the earth. The\\r\\ncloud moved all together, and yet the thousands of white flakes of\\r\\nwhich it was made up moved each for itself in ceaseless and rapid\\r\\nmotion: those flakes were the wings of pigeons.  Down swooped the birds\\r\\nupon the invaders; right in the face of man and horse they flew with\\r\\nswift-beating wings, blinding eyes and confounding brain.  Horses\\r\\nreared and plunged and wheeled.  All was at once in confusion.  The men\\r\\nmade frantic efforts to seize their tormentors, but not one could they\\r\\ntouch; and they outdoubled them in numbers. Between every wild clutch\\r\\ncame a peck of beak and a buffet of pinion in the face.  Generally the\\r\\nbird would, with sharp-clapping wings, dart its whole body, with the\\r\\nswiftness of an arrow, against its singled mark, yet so as to glance\\r\\naloft the same instant, and descend skimming; much as the thin stone,\\r\\nshot with horizontal cast of arm, having touched and torn the surface\\r\\nof the lake, ascends to skim, touch, and tear again.  So mingled the\\r\\nfeathered multitude in the grim game of war.  It was a storm in which\\r\\nthe wind was birds, and the sea men.  And ever as each bird arrived at\\r\\nthe rear of the enemy, it turned, ascended, and sped to the front to\\r\\ncharge again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe moment the battle began, the princess\\'s pony took fright, and\\r\\nturned and fled.  But the maid wheeled her horse across the road and\\r\\nstopped him; and they waited together the result of the battle.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd as they waited, it seemed to the princess right strange that the\\r\\npigeons, every one as it came to the rear, and fetched a compass to\\r\\ngather force for the reattack, should make the head of her attendant on\\r\\nthe red horse the goal around which it turned; so that about them was\\r\\nan unintermittent flapping and flashing of wings, and a curving,\\r\\nsweeping torrent of the side-poised wheeling bodies of birds.  Strange\\r\\nalso it seemed that the maid should be constantly waving her arm toward\\r\\nthe battle.  And the time of the motion of her arm so fitted with the\\r\\nrushes of birds, that it looked as if the birds obeyed her gesture, and\\r\\nshe was casting living javelins by the thousand against the enemy.  The\\r\\nmoment a pigeon had rounded her head, it went off straight as bolt from\\r\\nbow, and with trebled velocity.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut of these strange things, others besides the princess had taken\\r\\nnote.  From a rising ground whence they watched the battle in growing\\r\\ndismay, the leaders of the enemy saw the maid and her motions, and,\\r\\nconcluding her an enchantress, whose were the airy legions humiliating\\r\\nthem, set spurs to their horses, made a circuit, outflanked the king,\\r\\nand came down upon her.  But suddenly by her side stood a stalwart old\\r\\nman in the garb of a miner, who, as the general rode at her, sword in\\r\\nhand, heaved his swift mattock, and brought it down with such force on\\r\\nthe forehead of his charger, that he fell to the ground like a log.\\r\\nHis rider shot over his head and lay stunned.  Had not the great red\\r\\nhorse reared and wheeled, he would have fallen beneath that of the\\r\\ngeneral.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWith lifted sabre, one of his attendant officers rode at the miner. But\\r\\na mass of pigeons darted in the faces of him and his horse, and the\\r\\nnext moment he lay beside his commander.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe rest of them turned and fled, pursued by the birds.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Ah, friend Peter!\\' said the maid; \\'thou hast come as I told thee!\\r\\nWelcome and thanks!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy this time the battle was over.  The rout was general.  The enemy\\r\\nstormed back upon their own camp, with the beasts roaring in the midst\\r\\nof them, and the king and his army, now reinforced by one, pursuing.\\r\\nBut presently the king drew rein.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Call off your hounds, Curdie, and let the pigeons do the rest,\\' he\\r\\nshouted, and turned to see what had become of the princess.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn full panic fled the invaders, sweeping down their tents, stumbling\\r\\nover their baggage, trampling on their dead and wounded, ceaselessly\\r\\npursued and buffeted by the white-winged army of heaven.  Homeward they\\r\\nrushed the road they had come, straight for the borders, many dropping\\r\\nfrom pure fatigue, and lying where they fell.  And still the pigeons\\r\\nwere in their necks as they ran.  At length to the eyes of the king and\\r\\nhis army nothing was visible save a dust cloud below, and a bird cloud\\r\\nabove.  Before night the bird cloud came back, flying high over\\r\\nGwyntystorm.  Sinking swiftly, it disappeared among the ancient roofs\\r\\nof the palace.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap34\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 34\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nJudgement\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe king and his army returned, bringing with them one prisoner only,\\r\\nthe lord chancellor.  Curdie had dragged him from under a fallen tent,\\r\\nnot by the hand of a man, but by the foot of a mule.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen they entered the city, it was still as the grave.  The citizens\\r\\nhad fled home.  \\'We must submit,\\' they cried, \\'or the king and his\\r\\ndemons will destroy us.\\'  The king rode through the streets in silence,\\r\\nill-pleased with his people.  But he stopped his horse in the midst of\\r\\nthe market place, and called, in a voice loud and clear as the cry of a\\r\\nsilver trumpet, \\'Go and find your own.  Bury your dead, and bring home\\r\\nyour wounded.\\'  Then he turned him gloomily to the palace.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nJust as they reached the gates, Peter, who, as they went, had been\\r\\ntelling his tale to Curdie, ended it with the words:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'And so there I was, in the nick of time to save the two princesses!\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'The two princesses, Father!  The one on the great red horse was the\\r\\nhousemaid,\\' said Curdie, and ran to open the gates for the king.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey found Derba returned before them, and already busy preparing them\\r\\nfood.  The king put up his charger with his own hands, rubbed him down,\\r\\nand fed him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen they had washed, and eaten and drunk, he called the colonel, and\\r\\ntold Curdie and the page to bring out the traitors and the beasts, and\\r\\nattend him to the market place.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy this time the people were crowding back into the city, bearing their\\r\\ndead and wounded.  And there was lamentation in Gwyntystorm, for no one\\r\\ncould comfort himself, and no one had any to comfort him.  The nation\\r\\nwas victorious, but the people were conquered.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe king stood in the centre of the market place, upon the steps of the\\r\\nancient cross.  He had laid aside his helmet and put on his crown, but\\r\\nhe stood all armed beside, with his sword in his hand. He called the\\r\\npeople to him, and, for all the terror of the beasts, they dared not\\r\\ndisobey him.  Those, even, who were carrying their wounded laid them\\r\\ndown, and drew near trembling.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen the king said to Curdie and the page:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Set the evil men before me.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe looked upon them for a moment in mingled anger and pity, then turned\\r\\nto the people and said:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Behold your trust!  Ye slaves, behold your leaders!  I would have\\r\\nfreed you, but ye would not be free.  Now shall ye be ruled with a rod\\r\\nof iron, that ye may learn what freedom is, and love it and seek it.\\r\\nThese wretches I will send where they shall mislead you no longer.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe made a sign to Curdie, who immediately brought up the legserpent.\\r\\nTo the body of the animal they bound the lord chamberlain, speechless\\r\\nwith horror.  The butler began to shriek and pray, but they bound him\\r\\non the back of Clubhead.  One after another, upon the largest of the\\r\\ncreatures they bound the whole seven, each through the unveiling terror\\r\\nlooking the villain he was.  Then said the king:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'I thank you, my good beasts; and I hope to visit you ere long. Take\\r\\nthese evil men with you, and go to your place.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLike a whirlwind they were in the crowd, scattering it like dust. Like\\r\\nhounds they rushed from the city, their burdens howling and raving.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhat became of them I have never heard.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen the king turned once more to the people and said, \\'Go to your\\r\\nhouses\\'; nor vouchsafed them another word.  They crept home like\\r\\nchidden hounds.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe king returned to the palace.  He made the colonel a duke, and the\\r\\npage a knight, and Peter he appointed general of all his mines. But to\\r\\nCurdie he said:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'You are my own boy, Curdie.  My child cannot choose but love you, and\\r\\nwhen you are grown up\\xe2\\x80\\x94if you both will\\xe2\\x80\\x94you shall marry each other,\\r\\nand be king and queen when I am gone.  Till then be the king\\'s Curdie.\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIrene held out her arms to Curdie.  He raised her in his, and she\\r\\nkissed him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'And my Curdie too!\\' she said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThereafter the people called him Prince Conrad; but the king always\\r\\ncalled him either just Curdie, or my miner boy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey sat down to supper, and Derba and the knight and the housemaid\\r\\nwaited, and Barbara sat at the king\\'s left hand.  The housemaid poured\\r\\nout the wine; and as she poured for Curdie red wine that foamed in the\\r\\ncup, as if glad to see the light whence it had been banished so long,\\r\\nshe looked him in the eyes.  And Curdie started, and sprang from his\\r\\nseat, and dropped on his knees, and burst into tears.  And the maid\\r\\nsaid with a smile, such as none but one could smile:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\'Did I not tell you, Curdie, that it might be you would not know me\\r\\nwhen next you saw me?\\'\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen she went from the room, and in a moment returned in royal purple,\\r\\nwith a crown of diamonds and rubies, from under which her hair went\\r\\nflowing to the floor, all about her ruby-slippered feet. Her face was\\r\\nradiant with joy, the joy overshadowed by a faint mist as of\\r\\nunfulfilment.  The king rose and kneeled on one knee before her.  All\\r\\nkneeled in like homage.  Then the king would have yielded her his royal\\r\\nchair.  But she made them all sit down, and with her own hands placed\\r\\nat the table seats for Derba and the page.  Then in ruby crown and\\r\\nroyal purple she served them all.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><p><a id=\"chap35\"></a>\\r\\n</p><h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nCHAPTER 35\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\\r\\nThe End\\r\\n</h3>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe king sent Curdie out into his dominions to search for men and women\\r\\nthat had human hands.  And many such he found, honest and true, and\\r\\nbrought them to his master.  So a new and upright court was formed, and\\r\\nstrength returned to the nation.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut the exchequer was almost empty, for the evil men had squandered\\r\\neverything, and the king hated taxes unwillingly paid.  Then came\\r\\nCurdie and said to the king that the city stood upon gold.  And the\\r\\nking sent for men wise in the ways of the earth, and they built\\r\\nsmelting furnaces, and Peter brought miners, and they mined the gold,\\r\\nand smelted it, and the king coined it into money, and therewith\\r\\nestablished things well in the land.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe same day on which he found his boy, Peter set out to go home. When\\r\\nhe told the good news to Joan, his wife, she rose from her chair and\\r\\nsaid, \\'Let us go.\\'  And they left the cottage, and repaired to\\r\\nGwyntystorm.  And on a mountain above the city they built themselves a\\r\\nwarm house for their old age, high in the clear air.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs Peter mined one day, at the back of the king\\'s wine Cellar, he broke\\r\\ninto a cavern crusted with gems, and much wealth flowed therefrom, and\\r\\nthe king used it wisely.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nQueen Irene\\xe2\\x80\\x94that was the right name of the old princess\\xe2\\x80\\x94was\\r\\nthereafter seldom long absent from the palace.  Once or twice when she\\r\\nwas missing, Barbara, who seemed to know of her sometimes when nobody\\r\\nelse had a notion whither she had gone, said she was with the dear old\\r\\nUglies in the wood.  Curdie thought that perhaps her business might be\\r\\nwith others there as well.  All the uppermost rooms in the palace were\\r\\nleft to her use, and when any one was in need of her help, up thither\\r\\nhe must go.  But even when she was there, he did not always succeed in\\r\\nfinding her.  She, however, always knew that such a one had been\\r\\nlooking for her.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCurdie went to find her one day.  As he ascended the last stair, to\\r\\nmeet him came the well-known scent of her roses; and when he opened the\\r\\ndoor, lo! there was the same gorgeous room in which his touch had been\\r\\nglorified by her fire!  And there burned the fire\\xe2\\x80\\x94a huge heap of red\\r\\nand white roses.  Before the hearth stood the princess, an old\\r\\ngrey-haired woman, with Lina a little behind her, slowly wagging her\\r\\ntail, and looking like a beast of prey that can hardly so long restrain\\r\\nitself from springing as to be sure of its victim. The queen was\\r\\ncasting roses, more and more roses, upon the fire. At last she turned\\r\\nand said, \\'Now Lina!\\'\\xe2\\x80\\x94and Lina dashed burrowing into the fire.  There\\r\\nwent up a black smoke and a dust, and Lina was never more seen in the\\r\\npalace.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIrene and Curdie were married.  The old king died, and they were king\\r\\nand queen.  As long as they lived Gwyntystorm was a better city, and\\r\\ngood people grew in it.  But they had no children, and when they died\\r\\nthe people chose a king.  And the new king went mining and mining in\\r\\nthe rock under the city, and grew more and more eager after the gold,\\r\\nand paid less and less heed to his people.  Rapidly they sank toward\\r\\ntheir old wickedness.  But still the king went on mining, and coining\\r\\ngold by the pailful, until the people were worse even than in the old\\r\\ntime.  And so greedy was the king after gold, that when at last the ore\\r\\nbegan to fail, he caused the miners to reduce the pillars which Peter\\r\\nand they that followed him had left standing to bear the city.  And\\r\\nfrom the girth of an oak of a thousand years, they chipped them down to\\r\\nthat of a fir tree of fifty.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOne day at noon, when life was at its highest, the whole city fell with\\r\\na roaring crash.  The cries of men and the shrieks of women went up\\r\\nwith its dust, and then there was a great silence.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhere the mighty rock once towered, crowded with homes and crowned with\\r\\na palace, now rushes and raves a stone-obstructed rapid of the river.\\r\\nAll around spreads a wilderness of wild deer, and the very name of\\r\\nGwyntystorm had ceased from the lips of men.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>\\r\\n</p><pre></pre><section class=\"pg-boilerplate pgheader\" id=\"pg-footer\" lang=\"en\">\\r\\n        <div style=\"text-align:center\">\\r\\n            <span>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE PRINCESS AND CURDIE ***</span>\\r\\n        </div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\\xe2\\x80\\x94the old editions will\\r\\nbe renamed.\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\\r\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\r\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\r\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\r\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\r\\nroyalties.

They soon know that they will grow up, and\\r\\nthe way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playing\\r\\nin a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I\\r\\nsuppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand\\r\\nto her heart and cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, why can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you remain like this for\\r\\never!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This was all that passed between them on the subject, but\\r\\nhenceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two.\\r\\nTwo is the beginning of the end.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf course they lived at 14, and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one.\\r\\nShe was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth. Her\\r\\nromantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from the\\r\\npuzzling East, however many you discover there is always one more; and her\\r\\nsweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get, though there\\r\\nit was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been boys when\\r\\nshe was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her, and they all ran\\r\\nto her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who took a cab and nipped in\\r\\nfirst, and so he got her. He got all of her, except the innermost box and the\\r\\nkiss. He never knew about the box, and in time he gave up trying for the kiss.\\r\\nWendy thought Napoleon could have got it, but I can picture him trying, and\\r\\nthen going off in a passion, slamming the door.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him but\\r\\nrespected him. He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks and shares.\\r\\nOf course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know, and he often said\\r\\nstocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman\\r\\nrespect him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMrs. Darling was married in white, and at first she kept the books perfectly,\\r\\nalmost gleefully, as if it were a game, not so much as a Brussels sprout was\\r\\nmissing; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped out, and instead of them\\r\\nthere were pictures of babies without faces. She drew them when she should have\\r\\nbeen totting up. They were Mrs. Darling\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guesses.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWendy came first, then John, then Michael.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would be able\\r\\nto keep her, as she was another mouth to feed. Mr. Darling was frightfully\\r\\nproud of her, but he was very honourable, and he sat on the edge of Mrs.\\r\\nDarling\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bed, holding her hand and calculating expenses, while she\\r\\nlooked at him imploringly. She wanted to risk it, come what might, but that was\\r\\nnot his way; his way was with a pencil and a piece of paper, and if she\\r\\nconfused him with suggestions he had to begin at the beginning again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t interrupt,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he would beg of her.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office; I can\\r\\ncut off my coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine and six,\\r\\nwith your eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five naught naught in\\r\\nmy cheque-book makes eight nine seven\\xe2\\x80\\x94who is that moving?\\xe2\\x80\\x94eight\\r\\nnine seven, dot and carry seven\\xe2\\x80\\x94don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t speak, my own\\xe2\\x80\\x94and the\\r\\npound you lent to that man who came to the door\\xe2\\x80\\x94quiet, child\\xe2\\x80\\x94dot\\r\\nand carry child\\xe2\\x80\\x94there, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done it!\\xe2\\x80\\x94did I say nine nine\\r\\nseven? yes, I said nine nine seven; the question is, can we try it for a year\\r\\non nine nine seven?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course we can, George,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried. But she was prejudiced in\\r\\nWendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s favour, and he was really the grander character of the two.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRemember mumps,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he warned her almost threateningly, and off he\\r\\nwent again. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMumps one pound, that is what I have put down, but I daresay\\r\\nit will be more like thirty shillings\\xe2\\x80\\x94don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t speak\\xe2\\x80\\x94measles one\\r\\nfive, German measles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six\\xe2\\x80\\x94don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nwaggle your finger\\xe2\\x80\\x94whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\r\\nso on it went, and it added up differently each time; but at last Wendy just\\r\\ngot through, with mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles\\r\\ntreated as one.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a narrower\\r\\nsqueak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the three of them\\r\\ngoing in a row to Miss Fulsom\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Kindergarten school, accompanied by their\\r\\nnurse.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMrs. Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr. Darling had a passion\\r\\nfor being exactly like his neighbours; so, of course, they had a nurse. As they\\r\\nwere poor, owing to the amount of milk the children drank, this nurse was a\\r\\nprim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had belonged to no one in particular\\r\\nuntil the Darlings engaged her. She had always thought children important,\\r\\nhowever, and the Darlings had become acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens,\\r\\nwhere she spent most of her spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much\\r\\nhated by careless nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained\\r\\nof to their mistresses. She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. How\\r\\nthorough she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of her\\r\\ncharges made the slightest cry. Of course her kennel was in the nursery. She\\r\\nhad a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with and\\r\\nwhen it needs stocking around your throat. She believed to her last day in\\r\\nold-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf, and made sounds of contempt over all\\r\\nthis new-fangled talk about germs, and so on. It was a lesson in propriety to\\r\\nsee her escorting the children to school, walking sedately by their side when\\r\\nthey were well behaved, and butting them back into line if they strayed. On\\r\\nJohn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s footer days she never once forgot his sweater, and she usually\\r\\ncarried an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain. There is a room in the\\r\\nbasement of Miss Fulsom\\xe2\\x80\\x99s school where the nurses wait. They sat on\\r\\nforms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that was the only difference. They\\r\\naffected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to themselves, and she\\r\\ndespised their light talk. She resented visits to the nursery from Mrs.\\r\\nDarling\\xe2\\x80\\x99s friends, but if they did come she first whipped off\\r\\nMichael\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding, and\\r\\nsmoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hair.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNo nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and Mr. Darling\\r\\nknew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe had his position in the city to consider.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNana also troubled him in another way. He had sometimes a feeling that she did\\r\\nnot admire him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know she admires you tremendously, George,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mrs.\\r\\nDarling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children to be\\r\\nspecially nice to father. Lovely dances followed, in which the only other\\r\\nservant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join. Such a midget she looked in her\\r\\nlong skirt and maid\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cap, though she had sworn, when engaged, that she\\r\\nwould never see ten again. The gaiety of those romps! And gayest of all was\\r\\nMrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that all you could see of her was\\r\\nthe kiss, and then if you had dashed at her you might have got it. There never\\r\\nwas a simpler happier family until the coming of Peter Pan.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nminds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are\\r\\nasleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning,\\r\\nrepacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during\\r\\nthe day. If you could keep awake (but of course you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t) you would see\\r\\nyour own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch\\r\\nher. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I\\r\\nexpect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on\\r\\nearth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet,\\r\\npressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly\\r\\nstowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and\\r\\nevil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed\\r\\nat the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out\\r\\nyour prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mind.\\r\\nDoctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become\\r\\nintensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are\\r\\nzigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are\\r\\nprobably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an\\r\\nisland, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and\\r\\nrakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes\\r\\nwho are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with\\r\\nsix elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady\\r\\nwith a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also\\r\\nfirst day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders,\\r\\nhangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into\\r\\nbraces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and\\r\\nso on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing\\r\\nthrough, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand\\r\\nstill.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, for instance, had a\\r\\nlagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while\\r\\nMichael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John\\r\\nlived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in\\r\\na house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had\\r\\nfriends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the\\r\\nwhole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a\\r\\nrow you could say of them that they have each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nose, and so forth.\\r\\nOn these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles. We\\r\\ntoo have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall\\r\\nland no more.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not\\r\\nlarge and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and\\r\\nanother, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and\\r\\ntable-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you\\r\\ngo to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOccasionally in her travels through her children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s minds Mrs. Darling\\r\\nfound things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing\\r\\nwas the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John\\r\\nand Michael\\xe2\\x80\\x99s minds, while Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s began to be scrawled all over\\r\\nwith him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and\\r\\nas Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, he is rather cocky,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy admitted with regret. Her mother\\r\\nhad been questioning her.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut who is he, my pet?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is Peter Pan, you know, mother.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt first Mrs. Darling did not know, but after thinking back into her childhood\\r\\nshe just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the fairies. There\\r\\nwere odd stories about him, as that when children died he went part of the way\\r\\nwith them, so that they should not be frightened. She had believed in him at\\r\\nthe time, but now that she was married and full of sense she quite doubted\\r\\nwhether there was any such person.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBesides,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said to Wendy, \\xe2\\x80\\x9che would be grown up by this\\r\\ntime.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh no, he isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t grown up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy assured her confidently,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cand he is just my size.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She meant that he was her size in both\\r\\nmind and body; she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how she knew, she just knew it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMark my\\r\\nwords,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is some nonsense Nana has been putting into\\r\\ntheir heads; just the sort of idea a dog would have. Leave it alone, and it\\r\\nwill blow over.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs. Darling quite\\r\\na shock.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nChildren have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them. For\\r\\ninstance, they may remember to mention, a week after the event happened, that\\r\\nwhen they were in the wood they had met their dead father and had a game with\\r\\nhim. It was in this casual way that Wendy one morning made a disquieting\\r\\nrevelation. Some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor, which\\r\\ncertainly were not there when the children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling was\\r\\npuzzling over them when Wendy said with a tolerant smile:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do believe it is that Peter again!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhatever do you mean, Wendy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy said,\\r\\nsighing. She was a tidy child.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter sometimes\\r\\ncame to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her bed and played on\\r\\nhis pipes to her. Unfortunately she never woke, so she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how\\r\\nshe knew, she just knew.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat nonsense you talk, precious. No one can get into the house without\\r\\nknocking.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think he comes in by the window,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy love, it is three floors up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWere not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the window.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMrs. Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so natural to Wendy\\r\\nthat you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy child,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the mother cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhy did you not tell me of\\r\\nthis before?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI forgot,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Wendy lightly. She was in a hurry to get her\\r\\nbreakfast.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOh, surely she must have been dreaming.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut, on the other hand, there were the leaves. Mrs. Darling examined them very\\r\\ncarefully; they were skeleton leaves, but she was sure they did not come from\\r\\nany tree that grew in England. She crawled about the floor, peering at it with\\r\\na candle for marks of a strange foot. She rattled the poker up the chimney and\\r\\ntapped the walls. She let down a tape from the window to the pavement, and it\\r\\nwas a sheer drop of thirty feet, without so much as a spout to climb up by.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCertainly Wendy had been dreaming.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut Wendy had not been dreaming, as the very next night showed, the night on\\r\\nwhich the extraordinary adventures of these children may be said to have begun.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOn the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed. It happened to\\r\\nbe Nana\\xe2\\x80\\x99s evening off, and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and sung to them\\r\\ntill one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into the land of sleep.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAll were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and sat down\\r\\ntranquilly by the fire to sew.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting into shirts. The\\r\\nfire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three night-lights, and\\r\\npresently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lap. Then her head nodded, oh,\\r\\nso gracefully. She was asleep. Look at the four of them, Wendy and Michael over\\r\\nthere, John here, and Mrs. Darling by the fire. There should have been a fourth\\r\\nnight-light.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhile she slept she had a dream. She dreamt that the Neverland had come too\\r\\nnear and that a strange boy had broken through from it. He did not alarm her,\\r\\nfor she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many women who have no\\r\\nchildren. Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of some mothers also. But in\\r\\nher dream he had rent the film that obscures the Neverland, and she saw Wendy\\r\\nand John and Michael peeping through the gap.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was dreaming the\\r\\nwindow of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the floor. He was\\r\\naccompanied by a strange light, no bigger than your fist, which darted about\\r\\nthe room like a living thing and I think it must have been this light that\\r\\nwakened Mrs. Darling.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow she knew at once that\\r\\nhe was Peter Pan. If you or I or Wendy had been there we should have seen that\\r\\nhe was very like Mrs. Darling\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kiss. He was a lovely boy, clad in\\r\\nskeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees but the most entrancing\\r\\nthing about him was that he had all his first teeth. When he saw she was a\\r\\ngrown-up, he gnashed the little pearls at her.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"chap02\"></a>Chapter II.<br>\\r\\nTHE SHADOW</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened, and\\r\\nNana entered, returned from her evening out. She growled and sprang at the boy,\\r\\nwho leapt lightly through the window. Again Mrs. Darling screamed, this time in\\r\\ndistress for him, for she thought he was killed, and she ran down into the\\r\\nstreet to look for his little body, but it was not there; and she looked up,\\r\\nand in the black night she could see nothing but what she thought was a\\r\\nshooting star.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her mouth, which\\r\\nproved to be the boy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shadow. As he leapt at the window Nana had closed\\r\\nit quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had not had time to get out;\\r\\nslam went the window and snapped it off.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nYou may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was quite\\r\\nthe ordinary kind.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow. She hung\\r\\nit out at the window, meaning \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is sure to come back for it; let us put\\r\\nit where he can get it easily without disturbing the children.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the window, it\\r\\nlooked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the house. She thought\\r\\nof showing it to Mr. Darling, but he was totting up winter great-coats for John\\r\\nand Michael, with a wet towel around his head to keep his brain clear, and it\\r\\nseemed a shame to trouble him; besides, she knew exactly what he would say:\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt all comes of having a dog for a nurse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer, until\\r\\na fitting opportunity came for telling her husband. Ah me!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten Friday. Of\\r\\ncourse it was a Friday.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI ought to have been specially careful on a Friday,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she used to\\r\\nsay afterwards to her husband, while perhaps Nana was on the other side of her,\\r\\nholding her hand.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Darling always said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am responsible for it\\r\\nall. I, George Darling, did it. <i>Mea culpa, mea culpa</i>.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He had had\\r\\na classical education.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday, till every detail\\r\\nof it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other side like the\\r\\nfaces on a bad coinage.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mrs.\\r\\nDarling said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf only I had not poured my medicine into Nana\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bowl,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said\\r\\nMr. Darling.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf only I had pretended to like the medicine,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was what\\r\\nNana\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wet eyes said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy liking for parties, George.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy fatal gift of humour, dearest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy touchiness about trifles, dear master and mistress.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen one or more of them would break down altogether; Nana at the thought,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true, they ought not to have had a dog for a\\r\\nnurse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Many a time it was Mr. Darling who put the handkerchief to\\r\\nNana\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat fiend!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Darling would cry, and Nana\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bark was the\\r\\necho of it, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was something in the\\r\\nright-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call Peter names.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every smallest\\r\\ndetail of that dreadful evening. It had begun so uneventfully, so precisely\\r\\nlike a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the water for\\r\\nMichael\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bath and carrying him to it on her back.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go to bed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he had shouted, like one who still\\r\\nbelieved that he had the last word on the subject, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, I\\r\\nwon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Nana, it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t six o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock yet. Oh dear, oh dear, I\\r\\nshan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t love you any more, Nana. I tell you I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be bathed, I\\r\\nwon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen Mrs. Darling had come in, wearing her white evening-gown. She had dressed\\r\\nearly because Wendy so loved to see her in her evening-gown, with the necklace\\r\\nGeorge had given her. She was wearing Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bracelet on her arm; she\\r\\nhad asked for the loan of it. Wendy loved to lend her bracelet to her mother.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe had found her two older children playing at being herself and father on the\\r\\noccasion of Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s birth, and John was saying:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are now a\\r\\nmother,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in just such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used on the\\r\\nreal occasion.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWendy had danced with joy, just as the real Mrs. Darling must have done.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen John was born, with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the birth of a\\r\\nmale, and Michael came from his bath to ask to be born also, but John said\\r\\nbrutally that they did not want any more.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMichael had nearly cried. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNobody wants me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, and of course\\r\\nthe lady in the evening-dress could not stand that.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI so want a third child.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBoy or girl?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Michael, not too hopefully.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBoy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen he had leapt into her arms. Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs. Darling\\r\\nand Nana to recall now, but not so little if that was to be Michael\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nlast night in the nursery.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey go on with their recollections.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was then that I rushed in like a tornado, wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr.\\r\\nDarling would say, scorning himself; and indeed he had been like a tornado.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPerhaps there was some excuse for him. He, too, had been dressing for the\\r\\nparty, and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie. It is an\\r\\nastounding thing to have to tell, but this man, though he knew about stocks and\\r\\nshares, had no real mastery of his tie. Sometimes the thing yielded to him\\r\\nwithout a contest, but there were occasions when it would have been better for\\r\\nthe house if he had swallowed his pride and used a made-up tie.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThis was such an occasion. He came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled\\r\\nlittle brute of a tie in his hand.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, what is the matter, father dear?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMatter!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he yelled; he really yelled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis tie, it will not\\r\\ntie.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He became dangerously sarcastic. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot round my neck! Round\\r\\nthe bed-post! Oh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post, but\\r\\nround my neck, no! Oh dear no! begs to be excused!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed, and he went on sternly,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie is round my neck we\\r\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go out to dinner to-night, and if I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go out to dinner\\r\\nto-night, I never go to the office again, and if I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go to the office\\r\\nagain, you and I starve, and our children will be flung into the\\r\\nstreets.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEven then Mrs. Darling was placid. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet me try, dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said,\\r\\nand indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do, and with her nice cool\\r\\nhands she tied his tie for him, while the children stood around to see their\\r\\nfate decided. Some men would have resented her being able to do it so easily,\\r\\nbut Mr. Darling had far too fine a nature for that; he thanked her carelessly,\\r\\nat once forgot his rage, and in another moment was dancing round the room with\\r\\nMichael on his back.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow wildly we romped!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Mrs. Darling now, recalling it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur last romp!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Darling groaned.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cO George, do you remember Michael suddenly said to me, \\xe2\\x80\\x98How did\\r\\nyou get to know me, mother?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI remember!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey were rather sweet, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you think, George?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd they were ours, ours! and now they are gone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe romp had ended with the appearance of Nana, and most unluckily Mr. Darling\\r\\ncollided against her, covering his trousers with hairs. They were not only new\\r\\ntrousers, but they were the first he had ever had with braid on them, and he\\r\\nhad had to bite his lip to prevent the tears coming. Of course Mrs. Darling\\r\\nbrushed him, but he began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dog\\r\\nfor a nurse.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGeorge, Nana is a treasure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo doubt, but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon the\\r\\nchildren as puppies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh no, dear one, I feel sure she knows they have souls.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wonder,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Darling said thoughtfully, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wonder.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nIt was an opportunity, his wife felt, for telling him about the boy. At first\\r\\nhe pooh-poohed the story, but he became thoughtful when she showed him the\\r\\nshadow.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is nobody I know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, examining it carefully, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut\\r\\nit does look a scoundrel.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe were still discussing it, you remember,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Mr. Darling,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhen Nana came in with Michael\\xe2\\x80\\x99s medicine. You will never carry\\r\\nthe bottle in your mouth again, Nana, and it is all my fault.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nStrong man though he was, there is no doubt that he had behaved rather\\r\\nfoolishly over the medicine. If he had a weakness, it was for thinking that all\\r\\nhis life he had taken medicine boldly, and so now, when Michael dodged the\\r\\nspoon in Nana\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mouth, he had said reprovingly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBe a man,\\r\\nMichael.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t; won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Michael cried naughtily. Mrs. Darling\\r\\nleft the room to get a chocolate for him, and Mr. Darling thought this showed\\r\\nwant of firmness.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMother, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pamper him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he called after her.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMichael, when I was your age I took medicine without a murmur. I said,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Thank you, kind parents, for giving me bottles to make me\\r\\nwell.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe really thought this was true, and Wendy, who was now in her night-gown,\\r\\nbelieved it also, and she said, to encourage Michael, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat medicine you\\r\\nsometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEver so much nastier,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Darling said bravely, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I\\r\\nwould take it now as an example to you, Michael, if I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lost the\\r\\nbottle.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe had not exactly lost it; he had climbed in the dead of night to the top of\\r\\nthe wardrobe and hidden it there. What he did not know was that the faithful\\r\\nLiza had found it, and put it back on his wash-stand.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know where it is, father,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy cried, always glad to be of\\r\\nservice. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll bring it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and she was off before he could\\r\\nstop her. Immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJohn,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, shuddering, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most beastly stuff.\\r\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that nasty, sticky, sweet kind.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt will soon be over, father,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d John said cheerily, and then in\\r\\nrushed Wendy with the medicine in a glass.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have been as quick as I could,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she panted.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have been wonderfully quick,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d her father retorted, with a\\r\\nvindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMichael\\r\\nfirst,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said doggedly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFather first,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Michael, who was of a suspicious nature.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall be sick, you know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Darling said threateningly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome on, father,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said John.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHold your tongue, John,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d his father rapped out.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWendy was quite puzzled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought you took it quite easily,\\r\\nfather.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is not the point,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he retorted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe point is, that\\r\\nthere is more in my glass than in Michael\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spoon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d His proud heart\\r\\nwas nearly bursting. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fair: I would say it though it\\r\\nwere with my last breath; it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fair.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFather, I am waiting,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Michael coldly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all very well to say you are waiting; so am I waiting.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFather\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a cowardly custard.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo are you a cowardly custard.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not frightened.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNeither am I frightened.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, then, take it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, then, you take it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWendy had a splendid idea. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy not both take it at the same time?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Mr. Darling. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you ready,\\r\\nMichael?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWendy gave the words, one, two, three, and Michael took his medicine, but Mr.\\r\\nDarling slipped his behind his back.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere was a yell of rage from Michael, and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO father!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy\\r\\nexclaimed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you mean by \\xe2\\x80\\x98O father\\xe2\\x80\\x99?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mr. Darling demanded.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStop that row, Michael. I meant to take mine, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x94I missed\\r\\nit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him, just as if they did\\r\\nnot admire him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook here, all of you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said entreatingly, as\\r\\nsoon as Nana had gone into the bathroom. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have just thought of a\\r\\nsplendid joke. I shall pour my medicine into Nana\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bowl, and she will\\r\\ndrink it, thinking it is milk!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was the colour of milk; but the children did not have their father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nsense of humour, and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the medicine\\r\\ninto Nana\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bowl. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat fun!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said doubtfully, and they\\r\\ndid not dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNana, good dog,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, patting her, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have put a little\\r\\nmilk into your bowl, Nana.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNana wagged her tail, ran to the medicine, and began lapping it. Then she gave\\r\\nMr. Darling such a look, not an angry look: she showed him the great red tear\\r\\nthat makes us so sorry for noble dogs, and crept into her kennel.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself, but he would not give in. In a\\r\\nhorrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO George,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your medicine!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was only a joke,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he roared, while she comforted her boys, and\\r\\nWendy hugged Nana. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMuch good,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said bitterly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy wearing\\r\\nmyself to the bone trying to be funny in this house.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd still Wendy hugged Nana. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he shouted.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCoddle her! Nobody coddles me. Oh dear no! I am only the breadwinner,\\r\\nwhy should I be coddled\\xe2\\x80\\x94why, why, why!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGeorge,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Darling entreated him, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot so loud; the\\r\\nservants will hear you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Somehow they had got into the way of calling\\r\\nLiza the servants.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet them!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he answered recklessly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBring in the whole\\r\\nworld. But I refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour\\r\\nlonger.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe children wept, and Nana ran to him beseechingly, but he waved her back. He\\r\\nfelt he was a strong man again. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn vain, in vain,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried;\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe proper place for you is the yard, and there you go to be tied up\\r\\nthis instant.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGeorge, George,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Darling whispered, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cremember what I\\r\\ntold you about that boy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAlas, he would not listen. He was determined to show who was master in that\\r\\nhouse, and when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel, he lured her out\\r\\nof it with honeyed words, and seizing her roughly, dragged her from the\\r\\nnursery. He was ashamed of himself, and yet he did it. It was all owing to his\\r\\ntoo affectionate nature, which craved for admiration. When he had tied her up\\r\\nin the back-yard, the wretched father went and sat in the passage, with his\\r\\nknuckles to his eyes.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted silence\\r\\nand lit their night-lights. They could hear Nana barking, and John whimpered,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is because he is chaining her up in the yard,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but Wendy was\\r\\nwiser.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is not Nana\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unhappy bark,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, little guessing\\r\\nwhat was about to happen; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat is her bark when she smells\\r\\ndanger.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDanger!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you sure, Wendy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, yes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened. She\\r\\nlooked out, and the night was peppered with stars. They were crowding round the\\r\\nhouse, as if curious to see what was to take place there, but she did not\\r\\nnotice this, nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at her. Yet a\\r\\nnameless fear clutched at her heart and made her cry, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, how I wish\\r\\nthat I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to a party to-night!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEven Michael, already half asleep, knew that she was perturbed, and he asked,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan anything harm us, mother, after the night-lights are lit?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNothing, precious,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey are the eyes a mother\\r\\nleaves behind her to guard her children.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them, and little Michael\\r\\nflung his arms round her. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMother,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m glad\\r\\nof you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d They were the last words she was to hear from him for a long\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNo. 27 was only a few yards distant, but there had been a slight fall of snow,\\r\\nand Father and Mother Darling picked their way over it deftly not to soil their\\r\\nshoes. They were already the only persons in the street, and all the stars were\\r\\nwatching them. Stars are beautiful, but they may not take an active part in\\r\\nanything, they must just look on for ever. It is a punishment put on them for\\r\\nsomething they did so long ago that no star now knows what it was. So the older\\r\\nones have become glassy-eyed and seldom speak (winking is the star language),\\r\\nbut the little ones still wonder. They are not really friendly to Peter, who\\r\\nhad a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow them out;\\r\\nbut they are so fond of fun that they were on his side to-night, and anxious to\\r\\nget the grown-ups out of the way. So as soon as the door of 27 closed on Mr.\\r\\nand Mrs. Darling there was a commotion in the firmament, and the smallest of\\r\\nall the stars in the Milky Way screamed out:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, Peter!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"chap03\"></a>Chapter III.<br>\\r\\nCOME AWAY, COME AWAY!</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the night-lights by the\\r\\nbeds of the three children continued to burn clearly. They were awfully nice\\r\\nlittle night-lights, and one cannot help wishing that they could have kept\\r\\nawake to see Peter; but Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s light blinked and gave such a yawn that\\r\\nthe other two yawned also, and before they could close their mouths all the\\r\\nthree went out.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than the\\r\\nnight-lights, and in the time we have taken to say this, it had been in all the\\r\\ndrawers in the nursery, looking for Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shadow, rummaged the wardrobe\\r\\nand turned every pocket inside out. It was not really a light; it made this\\r\\nlight by flashing about so quickly, but when it came to rest for a second you\\r\\nsaw it was a fairy, no longer than your hand, but still growing. It was a girl\\r\\ncalled Tinker Bell exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf, cut low and square,\\r\\nthrough which her figure could be seen to the best advantage. She was slightly\\r\\ninclined to <i>embonpoint</i>.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA moment after the fairy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s entrance the window was blown open by the\\r\\nbreathing of the little stars, and Peter dropped in. He had carried Tinker Bell\\r\\npart of the way, and his hand was still messy with the fairy dust.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTinker Bell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he called softly, after making sure that the\\r\\nchildren were asleep, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTink, where are you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She was in a jug for\\r\\nthe moment, and liking it extremely; she had never been in a jug before.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do you know where they put my\\r\\nshadow?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him. It is the fairy language.\\r\\nYou ordinary children can never hear it, but if you were to hear it you would\\r\\nknow that you had heard it once before.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTink said that the shadow was in the big box. She meant the chest of drawers,\\r\\nand Peter jumped at the drawers, scattering their contents to the floor with\\r\\nboth hands, as kings toss ha\\xe2\\x80\\x99pence to the crowd. In a moment he had\\r\\nrecovered his shadow, and in his delight he forgot that he had shut Tinker Bell\\r\\nup in the drawer.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIf he thought at all, but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe he ever thought, it was that he\\r\\nand his shadow, when brought near each other, would join like drops of water,\\r\\nand when they did not he was appalled. He tried to stick it on with soap from\\r\\nthe bathroom, but that also failed. A shudder passed through Peter, and he sat\\r\\non the floor and cried.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHis sobs woke Wendy, and she sat up in bed. She was not alarmed to see a\\r\\nstranger crying on the nursery floor; she was only pleasantly interested.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBoy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said courteously, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhy are you crying?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter could be exceeding polite also, having learned the grand manner at fairy\\r\\nceremonies, and he rose and bowed to her beautifully. She was much pleased, and\\r\\nbowed beautifully to him from the bed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your name?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWendy Moira Angela Darling,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she replied with some satisfaction.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is your name?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter Pan.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe was already sure that he must be Peter, but it did seem a comparatively\\r\\nshort name.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs that all?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said rather sharply. He felt for the first time that it\\r\\nwas a shortish name.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so sorry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Wendy Moira Angela.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter gulped.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe asked where he lived.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSecond to the right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Peter, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand then straight on till\\r\\nmorning.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat a funny address!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter had a sinking. For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a funny\\r\\naddress.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI mean,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy said nicely, remembering that she was hostess,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cis that what they put on the letters?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe wished she had not mentioned letters.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get any letters,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said contemptuously.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut your mother gets letters?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a mother,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. Not only had he no mother,\\r\\nbut he had not the slightest desire to have one. He thought them very\\r\\nover-rated persons. Wendy, however, felt at once that she was in the presence\\r\\nof a tragedy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cO Peter, no wonder you were crying,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, and got out of bed\\r\\nand ran to him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t crying about mothers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said rather indignantly.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was crying because I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get my shadow to stick on. Besides, I\\r\\nwasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t crying.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt has come off?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen Wendy saw the shadow on the floor, looking so draggled, and she was\\r\\nfrightfully sorry for Peter. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow awful!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, but she could\\r\\nnot help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with soap.\\r\\nHow exactly like a boy!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFortunately she knew at once what to do. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt must be sewn on,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nsaid, just a little patronisingly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sewn?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re dreadfully ignorant.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut she was exulting in his ignorance. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall sew it on for you, my\\r\\nlittle man,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, though he was tall as herself, and she got out her\\r\\nhousewife, and sewed the shadow on to Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s foot.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI daresay it will hurt a little,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she warned him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, I shan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cry,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Peter, who was already of the\\r\\nopinion that he had never cried in his life. And he clenched his teeth and did\\r\\nnot cry, and soon his shadow was behaving properly, though still a little\\r\\ncreased.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps I should have ironed it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy said thoughtfully, but\\r\\nPeter, boylike, was indifferent to appearances, and he was now jumping about in\\r\\nthe wildest glee. Alas, he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss to\\r\\nWendy. He thought he had attached the shadow himself. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow clever I\\r\\nam!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he crowed rapturously, \\xe2\\x80\\x9coh, the cleverness of me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one of his\\r\\nmost fascinating qualities. To put it with brutal frankness, there never was a\\r\\ncockier boy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut for the moment Wendy was shocked. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou conceit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed,\\r\\nwith frightful sarcasm; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cof course I did nothing!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou did a little,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter said carelessly, and continued to dance.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA little!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she replied with hauteur; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif I am no use I can\\r\\nat least withdraw,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and\\r\\ncovered her face with the blankets.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTo induce her to look up he pretended to be going away, and when this failed he\\r\\nsat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his foot.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWendy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t withdraw. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help\\r\\ncrowing, Wendy, when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m pleased with myself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Still she would not\\r\\nlook up, though she was listening eagerly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWendy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued,\\r\\nin a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWendy, one\\r\\ngirl is more use than twenty boys.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow Wendy was every inch a woman, though there were not very many inches, and\\r\\nshe peeped out of the bed-clothes.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you really think so, Peter?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, I do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfectly sweet of you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she declared,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cand I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get up again,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and she sat with him on the side of\\r\\nthe bed. She also said she would give him a kiss if he liked, but Peter did not\\r\\nknow what she meant, and he held out his hand expectantly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSurely you know what a kiss is?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked, aghast.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall know when you give it to me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied stiffly, and not\\r\\nto hurt his feeling she gave him a thimble.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said he, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshall I give you a kiss?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and she\\r\\nreplied with a slight primness, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you please.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She made herself\\r\\nrather cheap by inclining her face toward him, but he merely dropped an acorn\\r\\nbutton into her hand, so she slowly returned her face to where it had been\\r\\nbefore, and said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain around her\\r\\nneck. It was lucky that she did put it on that chain, for it was afterwards to\\r\\nsave her life.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen people in our set are introduced, it is customary for them to ask each\\r\\nother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s age, and so Wendy, who always liked to do the correct thing,\\r\\nasked Peter how old he was. It was not really a happy question to ask him; it\\r\\nwas like an examination paper that asks grammar, when what you want to be asked\\r\\nis Kings of England.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied uneasily, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I am quite\\r\\nyoung.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He really knew nothing about it, he had merely suspicions, but he\\r\\nsaid at a venture, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWendy, I ran away the day I was born.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWendy was quite surprised, but interested; and she indicated in the charming\\r\\ndrawing-room manner, by a touch on her night-gown, that he could sit nearer\\r\\nher.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was because I heard father and mother,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained in a low\\r\\nvoice, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctalking about what I was to be when I became a man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He was\\r\\nextraordinarily agitated now. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want ever to be a\\r\\nman,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said with passion. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want always to be a little boy and\\r\\nto have fun. So I ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long time\\r\\namong the fairies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe gave him a look of the most intense admiration, and he thought it was\\r\\nbecause he had run away, but it was really because he knew fairies. Wendy had\\r\\nlived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as quite delightful. She\\r\\npoured out questions about them, to his surprise, for they were rather a\\r\\nnuisance to him, getting in his way and so on, and indeed he sometimes had to\\r\\ngive them a hiding. Still, he liked them on the whole, and he told her about\\r\\nthe beginning of fairies.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou see, Wendy, when the first baby laughed for the first time, its\\r\\nlaugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping about, and that\\r\\nwas the beginning of fairies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTedious talk this, but being a stay-at-home she liked it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd so,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he went on good-naturedly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere ought to be one\\r\\nfairy for every boy and girl.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOught to be? Isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t there?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo. You see children know such a lot now, they soon don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe\\r\\nin fairies, and every time a child says, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe in\\r\\nfairies,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nReally, he thought they had now talked enough about fairies, and it struck him\\r\\nthat Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think where she\\r\\nhas gone to,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, rising, and he called Tink by name. Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nheart went flutter with a sudden thrill.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, clutching him, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean to\\r\\ntell me that there is a fairy in this room!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe was here just now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said a little impatiently. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\r\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hear her, do you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and they both listened.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe only sound I hear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Wendy, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis like a tinkle of\\r\\nbells.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Tink, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the fairy language. I think I hear\\r\\nher too.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe sound came from the chest of drawers, and Peter made a merry face. No one\\r\\ncould ever look quite so merry as Peter, and the loveliest of gurgles was his\\r\\nlaugh. He had his first laugh still.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWendy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he whispered gleefully, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do believe I shut her up\\r\\nin the drawer!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe let poor Tink out of the drawer, and she flew about the nursery screaming\\r\\nwith fury. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say such things,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter retorted.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very sorry, but how could I know you were in the\\r\\ndrawer?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWendy was not listening to him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO Peter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif she\\r\\nwould only stand still and let me see her!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey hardly ever stand still,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, but for one moment Wendy\\r\\nsaw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO the\\r\\nlovely!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, though Tink\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face was still distorted with\\r\\npassion.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTink,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Peter amiably, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis lady says she wishes you\\r\\nwere her fairy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTinker Bell answered insolently.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat does she say, Peter?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe had to translate. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe is not very polite. She says you are a great\\r\\nugly girl, and that she is my fairy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe tried to argue with Tink. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be my fairy, Tink,\\r\\nbecause I am an gentleman and you are a lady.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTo this Tink replied in these words, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou silly ass,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and\\r\\ndisappeared into the bathroom. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe is quite a common fairy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter\\r\\nexplained apologetically, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe is called Tinker Bell because she mends\\r\\nthe pots and kettles.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey were together in the armchair by this time, and Wendy plied him with more\\r\\nquestions.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t live in Kensington Gardens now\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSometimes I do still.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut where do you live mostly now?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith the lost boys.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho are they?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the nurse\\r\\nis looking the other way. If they are not claimed in seven days they are sent\\r\\nfar away to the Neverland to defray expenses. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m captain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat fun it must be!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said cunning Peter, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut we are rather lonely. You see\\r\\nwe have no female companionship.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre none of the others girls?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, no; girls, you know, are much too clever to fall out of their\\r\\nprams.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThis flattered Wendy immensely. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is\\r\\nperfectly lovely the way you talk about girls; John there just despises\\r\\nus.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed, blankets and all; one kick.\\r\\nThis seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting, and she told him with\\r\\nspirit that he was not captain in her house. However, John continued to sleep\\r\\nso placidly on the floor that she allowed him to remain there. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I\\r\\nknow you meant to be kind,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, relenting, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cso you may give\\r\\nme a kiss.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought\\r\\nyou would want it back,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said a little bitterly, and offered to return\\r\\nher the thimble.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh dear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the nice Wendy, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean a kiss, I\\r\\nmean a thimble.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like this.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She kissed him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFunny!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Peter gravely. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow shall I give you a\\r\\nthimble?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you wish to,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Wendy, keeping her head erect this time.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter thimbled her, and almost immediately she screeched. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is it,\\r\\nWendy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat must have been Tink. I never knew her so naughty before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd indeed Tink was darting about again, using offensive language.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe says she will do that to you, Wendy, every time I give you a\\r\\nthimble.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut why?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, Tink?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAgain Tink replied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou silly ass.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter could not understand\\r\\nwhy, but Wendy understood, and she was just slightly disappointed when he\\r\\nadmitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen to\\r\\nstories.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou see, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know any stories. None of the lost boys knows any\\r\\nstories.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow perfectly awful,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter asked \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhy swallows build in the eaves\\r\\nof houses? It is to listen to the stories. O Wendy, your mother was telling you\\r\\nsuch a lovely story.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhich story was it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAbout the prince who couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find the lady who wore the glass\\r\\nslipper.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Wendy excitedly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat was Cinderella, and he\\r\\nfound her, and they lived happily ever after.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter was so glad that he rose from the floor, where they had been sitting, and\\r\\nhurried to the window.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere are you going?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried with misgiving.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo tell the other boys.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go Peter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she entreated, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI know such lots of\\r\\nstories.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThose were her precise words, so there can be no denying that it was she who\\r\\nfirst tempted him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe came back, and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to have\\r\\nalarmed her, but did not.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, the stories I could tell to the boys!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, and then\\r\\nPeter gripped her and began to draw her toward the window.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet me go!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she ordered him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWendy, do come with me and tell the other boys.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf course she was very pleased to be asked, but she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh dear, I\\r\\ncan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Think of mummy! Besides, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll teach you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, how lovely to fly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll teach you how to jump on the wind\\xe2\\x80\\x99s back, and then away\\r\\nwe go.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOo!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she exclaimed rapturously.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWendy, Wendy, when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be\\r\\nflying about with me saying funny things to the stars.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOo!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd, Wendy, there are mermaids.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMermaids! With tails?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuch long tails.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Wendy, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto see a mermaid!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe had become frightfully cunning. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWendy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow we\\r\\nshould all respect you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe was wriggling her body in distress. It was quite as if she were trying to\\r\\nremain on the nursery floor.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut he had no pity for her.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWendy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, the sly one, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou could tuck us in at\\r\\nnight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOo!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNone of us has ever been tucked in at night.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and her arms went out to him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd you could darn our clothes, and make pockets for us. None of us has\\r\\nany pockets.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHow could she resist. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s awfully fascinating!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nshe cried. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter, would you teach John and Michael to fly too?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you like,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said indifferently, and she ran to John and\\r\\nMichael and shook them. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWake up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter Pan has\\r\\ncome and he is to teach us to fly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nJohn rubbed his eyes. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen I shall get up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. Of course he\\r\\nwas on the floor already. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHallo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am up!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMichael was up by this time also, looking as sharp as a knife with six blades\\r\\nand a saw, but Peter suddenly signed silence. Their faces assumed the awful\\r\\ncraftiness of children listening for sounds from the grown-up world. All was as\\r\\nstill as salt. Then everything was right. No, stop! Everything was wrong. Nana,\\r\\nwho had been barking distressfully all the evening, was quiet now. It was her\\r\\nsilence they had heard.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOut with the light! Hide! Quick!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried John, taking command for\\r\\nthe only time throughout the whole adventure. And thus when Liza entered,\\r\\nholding Nana, the nursery seemed quite its old self, very dark, and you would\\r\\nhave sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing angelically as they\\r\\nslept. They were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLiza was in a bad temper, for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in the\\r\\nkitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a raisin still on her cheek, by\\r\\nNana\\xe2\\x80\\x99s absurd suspicions. She thought the best way of getting a little\\r\\nquiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment, but in custody of course.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere, you suspicious brute,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, not sorry that Nana was in\\r\\ndisgrace. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are perfectly safe, aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they? Every one of the\\r\\nlittle angels sound asleep in bed. Listen to their gentle breathing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHere Michael, encouraged by his success, breathed so loudly that they were\\r\\nnearly detected. Nana knew that kind of breathing, and she tried to drag\\r\\nherself out of Liza\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clutches.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut Liza was dense. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo more of it, Nana,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said sternly,\\r\\npulling her out of the room. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI warn you if you bark again I shall go\\r\\nstraight for master and missus and bring them home from the party, and then,\\r\\noh, won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t master whip you, just.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe tied the unhappy dog up again, but do you think Nana ceased to bark? Bring\\r\\nmaster and missus home from the party! Why, that was just what she wanted. Do\\r\\nyou think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her charges were safe?\\r\\nUnfortunately Liza returned to her puddings, and Nana, seeing that no help\\r\\nwould come from her, strained and strained at the chain until at last she broke\\r\\nit. In another moment she had burst into the dining-room of 27 and flung up her\\r\\npaws to heaven, her most expressive way of making a communication. Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nDarling knew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery,\\r\\nand without a good-bye to their hostess they rushed into the street.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing behind the\\r\\ncurtains, and Peter Pan can do a great deal in ten minutes.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWe now return to the nursery.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d John announced, emerging from his\\r\\nhiding-place. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI say, Peter, can you really fly?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nInstead of troubling to answer him Peter flew around the room, taking the\\r\\nmantelpiece on the way.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow topping!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said John and Michael.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow sweet!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Wendy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sweet, oh, I am sweet!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Peter, forgetting his\\r\\nmanners again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt looked delightfully easy, and they tried it first from the floor and then\\r\\nfrom the beds, but they always went down instead of up.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI say, how do you do it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked John, rubbing his knee. He was\\r\\nquite a practical boy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou just think lovely wonderful thoughts,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter explained,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cand they lift you up in the air.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe showed them again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so nippy at it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d John said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you\\r\\ndo it very slowly once?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter did it both slowly and quickly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got it now,\\r\\nWendy!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried John, but soon he found he had not. Not one of them could\\r\\nfly an inch, though even Michael was in words of two syllables, and Peter did\\r\\nnot know A from Z.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf course Peter had been trifling with them, for no one can fly unless the\\r\\nfairy dust has been blown on him. Fortunately, as we have mentioned, one of his\\r\\nhands was messy with it, and he blew some on each of them, with the most superb\\r\\nresults.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow just wiggle your shoulders this way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand let\\r\\ngo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey were all on their beds, and gallant Michael let go first. He did not quite\\r\\nmean to let go, but he did it, and immediately he was borne across the room.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI flewed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he screamed while still in mid-air.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nJohn let go and met Wendy near the bathroom.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, lovely!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, ripping!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook at me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook at me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook at me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey were not nearly so elegant as Peter, they could not help kicking a little,\\r\\nbut their heads were bobbing against the ceiling, and there is almost nothing\\r\\nso delicious as that. Peter gave Wendy a hand at first, but had to desist, Tink\\r\\nwas so indignant.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nUp and down they went, and round and round. Heavenly was Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s word.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI say,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried John, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhy shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we all go\\r\\nout?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf course it was to this that Peter had been luring them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMichael was ready: he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion miles.\\r\\nBut Wendy hesitated.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMermaids!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Peter again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOo!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd there are pirates.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPirates,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried John, seizing his Sunday hat, \\xe2\\x80\\x9clet us go at\\r\\nonce.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana out of\\r\\n27. They ran into the middle of the street to look up at the nursery window;\\r\\nand, yes, it was still shut, but the room was ablaze with light, and most\\r\\nheart-gripping sight of all, they could see in shadow on the curtain three\\r\\nlittle figures in night attire circling round and round, not on the floor but\\r\\nin the air.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNot three figures, four!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn a tremble they opened the street door. Mr. Darling would have rushed\\r\\nupstairs, but Mrs. Darling signed him to go softly. She even tried to make her\\r\\nheart go softly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWill they reach the nursery in time? If so, how delightful for them, and we\\r\\nshall all breathe a sigh of relief, but there will be no story. On the other\\r\\nhand, if they are not in time, I solemnly promise that it will all come right\\r\\nin the end.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the little\\r\\nstars were watching them. Once again the stars blew the window open, and that\\r\\nsmallest star of all called out:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCave, Peter!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\ncried imperiously, and soared out at once into the night, followed by John and\\r\\nMichael and Wendy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late. The birds were\\r\\nflown.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"chap04\"></a>Chapter IV.<br>\\r\\nTHE FLIGHT</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSecond to the right, and straight on till morning.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThat, Peter had told Wendy, was the way to the Neverland; but even birds,\\r\\ncarrying maps and consulting them at windy corners, could not have sighted it\\r\\nwith these instructions. Peter, you see, just said anything that came into his\\r\\nhead.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt first his companions trusted him implicitly, and so great were the delights\\r\\nof flying that they wasted time circling round church spires or any other tall\\r\\nobjects on the way that took their fancy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nJohn and Michael raced, Michael getting a start.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought themselves\\r\\nfine fellows for being able to fly round a room.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNot long ago. But how long ago? They were flying over the sea before this\\r\\nthought began to disturb Wendy seriously. John thought it was their second sea\\r\\nand their third night.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSometimes it was dark and sometimes light, and now they were very cold and\\r\\nagain too warm. Did they really feel hungry at times, or were they merely\\r\\npretending, because Peter had such a jolly new way of feeding them? His way was\\r\\nto pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable for humans and snatch it\\r\\nfrom them; then the birds would follow and snatch it back; and they would all\\r\\ngo chasing each other gaily for miles, parting at last with mutual expressions\\r\\nof good-will. But Wendy noticed with gentle concern that Peter did not seem to\\r\\nknow that this was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter, nor even\\r\\nthat there are other ways.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCertainly they did not pretend to be sleepy, they were sleepy; and that was a\\r\\ndanger, for the moment they popped off, down they fell. The awful thing was\\r\\nthat Peter thought this funny.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere he goes again!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he would cry gleefully, as Michael suddenly\\r\\ndropped like a stone.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSave him, save him!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Wendy, looking with horror at the cruel\\r\\nsea far below. Eventually Peter would dive through the air, and catch Michael\\r\\njust before he could strike the sea, and it was lovely the way he did it; but\\r\\nhe always waited till the last moment, and you felt it was his cleverness that\\r\\ninterested him and not the saving of human life. Also he was fond of variety,\\r\\nand the sport that engrossed him one moment would suddenly cease to engage him,\\r\\nso there was always the possibility that the next time you fell he would let\\r\\nyou go.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe could sleep in the air without falling, by merely lying on his back and\\r\\nfloating, but this was, partly at least, because he was so light that if you\\r\\ngot behind him and blew he went faster.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo be more polite to him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy whispered to John, when they were\\r\\nplaying \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFollow my Leader.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen tell him to stop showing off,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said John.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen playing Follow my Leader, Peter would fly close to the water and touch\\r\\neach shark\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tail in passing, just as in the street you may run your\\r\\nfinger along an iron railing. They could not follow him in this with much\\r\\nsuccess, so perhaps it was rather like showing off, especially as he kept\\r\\nlooking behind to see how many tails they missed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou must be nice to him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy impressed on her brothers.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat could we do if he were to leave us!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe could go back,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Michael said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow could we ever find our way back without him?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, then, we could go on,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said John.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is the awful thing, John. We should have to go on, for we\\r\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how to stop.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThis was true, Peter had forgotten to show them how to stop.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nJohn said that if the worst came to the worst, all they had to do was to go\\r\\nstraight on, for the world was round, and so in time they must come back to\\r\\ntheir own window.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd who is to get food for us, John?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI nipped a bit out of that eagle\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mouth pretty neatly,\\r\\nWendy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAfter the twentieth try,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy reminded him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd even\\r\\nthough we became good at picking up food, see how we bump against clouds and\\r\\nthings if he is not near to give us a hand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIndeed they were constantly bumping. They could now fly strongly, though they\\r\\nstill kicked far too much; but if they saw a cloud in front of them, the more\\r\\nthey tried to avoid it, the more certainly did they bump into it. If Nana had\\r\\nbeen with them, she would have had a bandage round Michael\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forehead by\\r\\nthis time.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter was not with them for the moment, and they felt rather lonely up there by\\r\\nthemselves. He could go so much faster than they that he would suddenly shoot\\r\\nout of sight, to have some adventure in which they had no share. He would come\\r\\ndown laughing over something fearfully funny he had been saying to a star, but\\r\\nhe had already forgotten what it was, or he would come up with mermaid scales\\r\\nstill sticking to him, and yet not be able to say for certain what had been\\r\\nhappening. It was really rather irritating to children who had never seen a\\r\\nmermaid.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd if he forgets them so quickly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy argued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow can\\r\\nwe expect that he will go on remembering us?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIndeed, sometimes when he returned he did not remember them, at least not well.\\r\\nWendy was sure of it. She saw recognition come into his eyes as he was about to\\r\\npass them the time of day and go on; once even she had to call him by name.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Wendy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said agitatedly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe was very sorry. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI say, Wendy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he whispered to her,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9calways if you see me forgetting you, just keep on saying\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m Wendy,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and then I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll remember.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf course this was rather unsatisfactory. However, to make amends he showed\\r\\nthem how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their way, and this\\r\\nwas such a pleasant change that they tried it several times and found that they\\r\\ncould sleep thus with security. Indeed they would have slept longer, but Peter\\r\\ntired quickly of sleeping, and soon he would cry in his captain voice,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe get off here.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d So with occasional tiffs, but on the whole\\r\\nrollicking, they drew near the Neverland; for after many moons they did reach\\r\\nit, and, what is more, they had been going pretty straight all the time, not\\r\\nperhaps so much owing to the guidance of Peter or Tink as because the island\\r\\nwas looking for them. It is only thus that any one may sight those magic\\r\\nshores.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere it is,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Peter calmly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere, where?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere all the arrows are pointing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIndeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to the children, all\\r\\ndirected by their friend the sun, who wanted them to be sure of their way\\r\\nbefore leaving them for the night.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWendy and John and Michael stood on tip-toe in the air to get their first sight\\r\\nof the island. Strange to say, they all recognized it at once, and until fear\\r\\nfell upon them they hailed it, not as something long dreamt of and seen at\\r\\nlast, but as a familiar friend to whom they were returning home for the\\r\\nholidays.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJohn, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the lagoon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWendy, look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI say, John, I see your flamingo with the broken leg!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook, Michael, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your cave!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJohn, what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that in the brushwood?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a wolf with her whelps. Wendy, I do believe that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your\\r\\nlittle whelp!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my boat, John, with her sides stove in!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Why, we burned your boat.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s her, at any rate. I say, John, I see the smoke of the\\r\\nredskin camp!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere? Show me, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you by the way smoke curls whether\\r\\nthey are on the war-path.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere, just across the Mysterious River.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see now. Yes, they are on the war-path right enough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much, but if he wanted to\\r\\nlord it over them his triumph was at hand, for have I not told you that anon\\r\\nfear fell upon them?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt came as the arrows went, leaving the island in gloom.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the old days at home the Neverland had always begun to look a little dark\\r\\nand threatening by bedtime. Then unexplored patches arose in it and spread,\\r\\nblack shadows moved about in them, the roar of the beasts of prey was quite\\r\\ndifferent now, and above all, you lost the certainty that you would win. You\\r\\nwere quite glad that the night-lights were on. You even liked Nana to say that\\r\\nthis was just the mantelpiece over here, and that the Neverland was all\\r\\nmake-believe.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days, but it was real\\r\\nnow, and there were no night-lights, and it was getting darker every moment,\\r\\nand where was Nana?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey had been flying apart, but they huddled close to Peter now. His careless\\r\\nmanner had gone at last, his eyes were sparkling, and a tingle went through\\r\\nthem every time they touched his body. They were now over the fearsome island,\\r\\nflying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their feet. Nothing horrid was\\r\\nvisible in the air, yet their progress had become slow and laboured, exactly as\\r\\nif they were pushing their way through hostile forces. Sometimes they hung in\\r\\nthe air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want us to land,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho are they?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy whispered, shuddering.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut he could not or would not say. Tinker Bell had been asleep on his shoulder,\\r\\nbut now he wakened her and sent her on in front.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSometimes he poised himself in the air, listening intently, with his hand to\\r\\nhis ear, and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that they seemed to\\r\\nbore two holes to earth. Having done these things, he went on again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHis courage was almost appalling. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWould you like an adventure\\r\\nnow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said casually to John, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cor would you like to have your tea\\r\\nfirst?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWendy said \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctea first\\xe2\\x80\\x9d quickly, and Michael pressed her hand in\\r\\ngratitude, but the braver John hesitated.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat kind of adventure?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked cautiously.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nPeter told him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you like, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go down and kill him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d John said after a long pause.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuppose,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d John said, a little huskily, \\xe2\\x80\\x9che were to wake\\r\\nup.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter spoke indignantly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I would kill him while he\\r\\nwas sleeping! I would wake him first, and then kill him. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way I\\r\\nalways do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI say! Do you kill many?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTons.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nJohn said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow ripping,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but decided to have tea first. He asked if\\r\\nthere were many pirates on the island just now, and Peter said he had never\\r\\nknown so many.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho is captain now?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHook,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d answered Peter, and his face became very stern as he said\\r\\nthat hated word.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJas. Hook?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen indeed Michael began to cry, and even John could speak in gulps only, for\\r\\nthey knew Hook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reputation.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe was Blackbeard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bo\\xe2\\x80\\x99sun,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d John whispered huskily.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is the worst of them all. He is the only man of whom Barbecue was\\r\\nafraid.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s him,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Peter.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is he like? Is he big?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is not so big as he was.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow do you mean?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cut off a bit of him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Peter sharply.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t meaning to be disrespectful.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, all right.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, I say, what bit?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHis right hand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen he can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fight now?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he just!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLeft-hander?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe has an iron hook instead of a right hand, and he claws with\\r\\nit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cClaws!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI say, John,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Peter.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSay, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Ay, ay, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAy, ay, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is one thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter continued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat every boy who\\r\\nserves under me has to promise, and so must you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nJohn paled.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is this, if we meet Hook in open fight, you must leave him to\\r\\nme.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI promise,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d John said loyally.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor the moment they were feeling less eerie, because Tink was flying with them,\\r\\nand in her light they could distinguish each other. Unfortunately she could not\\r\\nfly so slowly as they, and so she had to go round and round them in a circle in\\r\\nwhich they moved as in a halo. Wendy quite liked it, until Peter pointed out\\r\\nthe drawbacks.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe tells me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat the pirates sighted us before\\r\\nthe darkness came, and got Long Tom out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe big gun?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.

It is the only\\r\\nother thing fairies can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSeems to me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d growled John, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthese are the only two things\\r\\nworth doing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHere he got a pinch, but not a loving one.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf only one of us had a pocket,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe could carry\\r\\nher in it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d However, they had set off in such a hurry that there was not\\r\\na pocket between the four of them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe had a happy idea. John\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hat!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand. John carried it,\\r\\nthough she had hoped to be carried by Peter. Presently Wendy took the hat,\\r\\nbecause John said it struck against his knee as he flew; and this, as we shall\\r\\nsee, led to mischief, for Tinker Bell hated to be under an obligation to Wendy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the black topper the light was completely hidden, and they flew on in\\r\\nsilence. It was the stillest silence they had ever known, broken once by a\\r\\ndistant lapping, which Peter explained was the wild beasts drinking at the\\r\\nford, and again by a rasping sound that might have been the branches of trees\\r\\nrubbing together, but he said it was the redskins sharpening their knives.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEven these noises ceased. To Michael the loneliness was dreadful. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf\\r\\nonly something would make a sound!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs if in answer to his request, the air was rent by the most tremendous crash\\r\\nhe had ever heard. The pirates had fired Long Tom at them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe roar of it echoed through the mountains, and the echoes seemed to cry\\r\\nsavagely, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere are they, where are they, where are they?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an island of\\r\\nmake-believe and the same island come true.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen at last the heavens were steady again, John and Michael found themselves\\r\\nalone in the darkness. John was treading the air mechanically, and Michael\\r\\nwithout knowing how to float was floating.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you shot?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d John whispered tremulously.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tried yet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Michael whispered back.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWe know now that no one had been hit. Peter, however, had been carried by the\\r\\nwind of the shot far out to sea, while Wendy was blown upwards with no\\r\\ncompanion but Tinker Bell.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt would have been well for Wendy if at that moment she had dropped the hat.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know whether the idea came suddenly to Tink, or whether she had\\r\\nplanned it on the way, but she at once popped out of the hat and began to lure\\r\\nWendy to her destruction.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTink was not all bad; or, rather, she was all bad just now, but, on the other\\r\\nhand, sometimes she was all good. Fairies have to be one thing or the other,\\r\\nbecause being so small they unfortunately have room for one feeling only at a\\r\\ntime. They are, however, allowed to change, only it must be a complete change.\\r\\nAt present she was full of jealousy of Wendy. What she said in her lovely\\r\\ntinkle Wendy could not of course understand, and I believe some of it was bad\\r\\nwords, but it sounded kind, and she flew back and forward, plainly meaning\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFollow me, and all will be well.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhat else could poor Wendy do? She called to Peter and John and Michael, and\\r\\ngot only mocking echoes in reply. She did not yet know that Tink hated her with\\r\\nthe fierce hatred of a very woman. And so, bewildered, and now staggering in\\r\\nher flight, she followed Tink to her doom.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"chap05\"></a>Chapter V.<br>\\r\\nTHE ISLAND COME TRUE</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFeeling that Peter was on his way back, the Neverland had again woke into life.\\r\\nWe ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened, but woke is better and was\\r\\nalways used by Peter.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn his absence things are usually quiet on the island. The fairies take an hour\\r\\nlonger in the morning, the beasts attend to their young, the redskins feed\\r\\nheavily for six days and nights, and when pirates and lost boys meet they\\r\\nmerely bite their thumbs at each other. But with the coming of Peter, who hates\\r\\nlethargy, they are under way again: if you put your ear to the ground now, you\\r\\nwould hear the whole island seething with life.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOn this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as follows. The\\r\\nlost boys were out looking for Peter, the pirates were out looking for the lost\\r\\nboys, the redskins were out looking for the pirates, and the beasts were out\\r\\nlooking for the redskins. They were going round and round the island, but they\\r\\ndid not meet because all were going at the same rate.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAll wanted blood except the boys, who liked it as a rule, but to-night were out\\r\\nto greet their captain. The boys on the island vary, of course, in numbers,\\r\\naccording as they get killed and so on; and when they seem to be growing up,\\r\\nwhich is against the rules, Peter thins them out; but at this time there were\\r\\nsix of them, counting the twins as two. Let us pretend to lie here among the\\r\\nsugar-cane and watch them as they steal by in single file, each with his hand\\r\\non his dagger.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey are forbidden by Peter to look in the least like him, and they wear the\\r\\nskins of the bears slain by themselves, in which they are so round and furry\\r\\nthat when they fall they roll. They have therefore become very sure-footed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe first to pass is Tootles, not the least brave but the most unfortunate of\\r\\nall that gallant band. He had been in fewer adventures than any of them,\\r\\nbecause the big things constantly happened just when he had stepped round the\\r\\ncorner; all would be quiet, he would take the opportunity of going off to\\r\\ngather a few sticks for firewood, and then when he returned the others would be\\r\\nsweeping up the blood. This ill-luck had given a gentle melancholy to his\\r\\ncountenance, but instead of souring his nature had sweetened it, so that he was\\r\\nquite the humblest of the boys. Poor kind Tootles, there is danger in the air\\r\\nfor you to-night. Take care lest an adventure is now offered you, which, if\\r\\naccepted, will plunge you in deepest woe. Tootles, the fairy Tink, who is bent\\r\\non mischief this night is looking for a tool, and she thinks you are the most\\r\\neasily tricked of the boys. \\xe2\\x80\\x99Ware Tinker Bell.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWould that he could hear us, but we are not really on the island, and he passes\\r\\nby, biting his knuckles.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNext comes Nibs, the gay and debonair, followed by Slightly, who cuts whistles\\r\\nout of the trees and dances ecstatically to his own tunes. Slightly is the most\\r\\nconceited of the boys. He thinks he remembers the days before he was lost, with\\r\\ntheir manners and customs, and this has given his nose an offensive tilt. Curly\\r\\nis fourth; he is a pickle, and so often has he had to deliver up his person\\r\\nwhen Peter said sternly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStand forth the one who did this thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nthat now at the command he stands forth automatically whether he has done it or\\r\\nnot. Last come the Twins, who cannot be described because we should be sure to\\r\\nbe describing the wrong one. Peter never quite knew what twins were, and his\\r\\nband were not allowed to know anything he did not know, so these two were\\r\\nalways vague about themselves, and did their best to give satisfaction by\\r\\nkeeping close together in an apologetic sort of way.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe boys vanish in the gloom, and after a pause, but not a long pause, for\\r\\nthings go briskly on the island, come the pirates on their track. We hear them\\r\\nbefore they are seen, and it is always the same dreadful song:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"poem\">\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAvast belay, yo ho, heave to,<br>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0A-pirating we go,<br>\\r\\nAnd if we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re parted by a shot<br>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sure to meet below!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA more villainous-looking lot never hung in a row on Execution dock. Here, a\\r\\nlittle in advance, ever and again with his head to the ground listening, his\\r\\ngreat arms bare, pieces of eight in his ears as ornaments, is the handsome\\r\\nItalian Cecco, who cut his name in letters of blood on the back of the governor\\r\\nof the prison at Gao. That gigantic black behind him has had many names since\\r\\nhe dropped the one with which dusky mothers still terrify their children on the\\r\\nbanks of the Guadjo-mo. Here is Bill Jukes, every inch of him tattooed, the\\r\\nsame Bill Jukes who got six dozen on the <i>Walrus</i> from Flint before he\\r\\nwould drop the bag of moidores; and Cookson, said to be Black Murphy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nbrother (but this was never proved), and Gentleman Starkey, once an usher in a\\r\\npublic school and still dainty in his ways of killing; and Skylights\\r\\n(Morgan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Skylights); and the Irish bo\\xe2\\x80\\x99sun Smee, an oddly genial\\r\\nman who stabbed, so to speak, without offence, and was the only Non-conformist\\r\\nin Hook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crew; and Noodler, whose hands were fixed on backwards; and\\r\\nRobt. Mullins and Alf Mason and many another ruffian long known and feared on\\r\\nthe Spanish Main.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the midst of them, the blackest and largest in that dark setting, reclined\\r\\nJames Hook, or as he wrote himself, Jas. Hook, of whom it is said he was the\\r\\nonly man that the Sea-Cook feared. He lay at his ease in a rough chariot drawn\\r\\nand propelled by his men, and instead of a right hand he had the iron hook with\\r\\nwhich ever and anon he encouraged them to increase their pace. As dogs this\\r\\nterrible man treated and addressed them, and as dogs they obeyed him. In person\\r\\nhe was cadaverous and blackavized, and his hair was dressed in long curls,\\r\\nwhich at a little distance looked like black candles, and gave a singularly\\r\\nthreatening expression to his handsome countenance. His eyes were of the blue\\r\\nof the forget-me-not, and of a profound melancholy, save when he was plunging\\r\\nhis hook into you, at which time two red spots appeared in them and lit them up\\r\\nhorribly. In manner, something of the grand seigneur still clung to him, so\\r\\nthat he even ripped you up with an air, and I have been told that he was a\\r\\n<i>raconteur</i> of repute. He was never more sinister than when he was most\\r\\npolite, which is probably the truest test of breeding; and the elegance of his\\r\\ndiction, even when he was swearing, no less than the distinction of his\\r\\ndemeanour, showed him one of a different cast from his crew. A man of\\r\\nindomitable courage, it was said that the only thing he shied at was the sight\\r\\nof his own blood, which was thick and of an unusual colour. In dress he\\r\\nsomewhat aped the attire associated with the name of Charles II, having heard\\r\\nit said in some earlier period of his career that he bore a strange resemblance\\r\\nto the ill-fated Stuarts; and in his mouth he had a holder of his own\\r\\ncontrivance which enabled him to smoke two cigars at once. But undoubtedly the\\r\\ngrimmest part of him was his iron claw.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLet us now kill a pirate, to show Hook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s method. Skylights will do. As\\r\\nthey pass, Skylights lurches clumsily against him, ruffling his lace collar;\\r\\nthe hook shoots forth, there is a tearing sound and one screech, then the body\\r\\nis kicked aside, and the pirates pass on. He has not even taken the cigars from\\r\\nhis mouth.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSuch is the terrible man against whom Peter Pan is pitted. Which will win?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOn the trail of the pirates, stealing noiselessly down the war-path, which is\\r\\nnot visible to inexperienced eyes, come the redskins, every one of them with\\r\\nhis eyes peeled. They carry tomahawks and knives, and their naked bodies gleam\\r\\nwith paint and oil. Strung around them are scalps, of boys as well as of\\r\\npirates, for these are the Piccaninny tribe, and not to be confused with the\\r\\nsofter-hearted Delawares or the Hurons. In the van, on all fours, is Great Big\\r\\nLittle Panther, a brave of so many scalps that in his present position they\\r\\nsomewhat impede his progress. Bringing up the rear, the place of greatest\\r\\ndanger, comes Tiger Lily, proudly erect, a princess in her own right. She is\\r\\nthe most beautiful of dusky Dianas and the belle of the Piccaninnies,\\r\\ncoquettish, cold and amorous by turns; there is not a brave who would not have\\r\\nthe wayward thing to wife, but she staves off the altar with a hatchet. Observe\\r\\nhow they pass over fallen twigs without making the slightest noise. The only\\r\\nsound to be heard is their somewhat heavy breathing. The fact is that they are\\r\\nall a little fat just now after the heavy gorging, but in time they will work\\r\\nthis off. For the moment, however, it constitutes their chief danger.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe redskins disappear as they have come like shadows, and soon their place is\\r\\ntaken by the beasts, a great and motley procession: lions, tigers, bears, and\\r\\nthe innumerable smaller savage things that flee from them, for every kind of\\r\\nbeast, and, more particularly, all the man-eaters, live cheek by jowl on the\\r\\nfavoured island. Their tongues are hanging out, they are hungry to-night.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen they have passed, comes the last figure of all, a gigantic crocodile. We\\r\\nshall see for whom she is looking presently.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe crocodile passes, but soon the boys appear again, for the procession must\\r\\ncontinue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or changes its pace. Then\\r\\nquickly they will be on top of each other.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAll are keeping a sharp look-out in front, but none suspects that the danger\\r\\nmay be creeping up from behind. This shows how real the island was.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys. They flung themselves\\r\\ndown on the sward, close to their underground home.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do wish Peter would come back,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d every one of them said\\r\\nnervously, though in height and still more in breadth they were all larger than\\r\\ntheir captain.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Slightly\\r\\nsaid, in the tone that prevented his being a general favourite; but perhaps\\r\\nsome distant sound disturbed him, for he added hastily, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I wish he\\r\\nwould come back, and tell us whether he has heard anything more about\\r\\nCinderella.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey talked of Cinderella, and Tootles was confident that his mother must have\\r\\nbeen very like her.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was only in Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s absence that they could speak of mothers, the\\r\\nsubject being forbidden by him as silly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll I remember about my mother,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nibs told them, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis that\\r\\nshe often said to my father, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh, how I wish I had a cheque-book of my\\r\\nown!\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what a cheque-book is, but I should just love to\\r\\ngive my mother one.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhile they talked they heard a distant sound. You or I, not being wild things\\r\\nof the woods, would have heard nothing, but they heard it, and it was the grim\\r\\nsong:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"poem\">\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYo ho, yo ho, the pirate life,<br>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0The flag o\\xe2\\x80\\x99 skull and bones,<br>\\r\\nA merry hour, a hempen rope,<br>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0And hey for Davy Jones.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt once the lost boys\\xe2\\x80\\x94but where are they? They are no longer there.\\r\\nRabbits could not have disappeared more quickly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI will tell you where they are. With the exception of Nibs, who has darted away\\r\\nto reconnoitre, they are already in their home under the ground, a very\\r\\ndelightful residence of which we shall see a good deal presently. But how have\\r\\nthey reached it? for there is no entrance to be seen, not so much as a large\\r\\nstone, which if rolled away, would disclose the mouth of a cave. Look closely,\\r\\nhowever, and you may note that there are here seven large trees, each with a\\r\\nhole in its hollow trunk as large as a boy. These are the seven entrances to\\r\\nthe home under the ground, for which Hook has been searching in vain these many\\r\\nmoons. Will he find it tonight?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs the pirates advanced, the quick eye of Starkey sighted Nibs disappearing\\r\\nthrough the wood, and at once his pistol flashed out. But an iron claw gripped\\r\\nhis shoulder.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCaptain, let go!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried, writhing.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow for the first time we hear the voice of Hook. It was a black voice.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPut back that pistol first,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it said threateningly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was one of those boys you hate. I could have shot him dead.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAy, and the sound would have brought Tiger Lily\\xe2\\x80\\x99s redskins upon\\r\\nus. Do you want to lose your scalp?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShall I after him, Captain,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked pathetic Smee, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand\\r\\ntickle him with Johnny Corkscrew?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Smee had pleasant names for\\r\\neverything, and his cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew, because he wiggled it in the\\r\\nwound. One could mention many lovable traits in Smee. For instance, after\\r\\nkilling, it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJohnny\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a silent fellow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he reminded Hook.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot now, Smee,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hook said darkly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is only one, and I\\r\\nwant to mischief all the seven. Scatter and look for them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe pirates disappeared among the trees, and in a moment their Captain and Smee\\r\\nwere alone. Hook heaved a heavy sigh, and I know not why it was, perhaps it was\\r\\nbecause of the soft beauty of the evening, but there came over him a desire to\\r\\nconfide to his faithful bo\\xe2\\x80\\x99sun the story of his life. He spoke long and\\r\\nearnestly, but what it was all about Smee, who was rather stupid, did not know\\r\\nin the least.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnon he caught the word Peter.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMost of all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hook was saying passionately, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want their\\r\\ncaptain, Peter Pan. \\xe2\\x80\\x99Twas he cut off my arm.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He brandished the\\r\\nhook threateningly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve waited long to shake his hand with this.\\r\\nOh, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tear him!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd yet,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Smee, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have often heard you say that hook\\r\\nwas worth a score of hands, for combing the hair and other homely uses.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the captain answered, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif I was a mother I would pray\\r\\nto have my children born with this instead of that,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and he cast a look\\r\\nof pride upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other. Then again he\\r\\nfrowned.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter flung my arm,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, wincing, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto a crocodile that\\r\\nhappened to be passing by.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have often,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Smee, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnoticed your strange dread of\\r\\ncrocodiles.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot of crocodiles,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hook corrected him, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut of that one\\r\\ncrocodile.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He lowered his voice. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt liked my arm so much, Smee,\\r\\nthat it has followed me ever since, from sea to sea and from land to land,\\r\\nlicking its lips for the rest of me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn a way,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Smee, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sort of a\\r\\ncompliment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want no such compliments,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hook barked petulantly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI want\\r\\nPeter Pan, who first gave the brute its taste for me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe sat down on a large mushroom, and now there was a quiver in his voice.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmee,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said huskily, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat crocodile would have had me\\r\\nbefore this, but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick tick\\r\\ninside it, and so before it can reach me I hear the tick and bolt.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He\\r\\nlaughed, but in a hollow way.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSome day,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Smee, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe clock will run down, and then\\r\\nhe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHook wetted his dry lips. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the\\r\\nfear that haunts me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSince sitting down he had felt curiously warm. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmee,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis seat is hot.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He jumped up. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOdds bobs, hammer and\\r\\ntongs I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m burning.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey examined the mushroom, which was of a size and solidity unknown on the\\r\\nmainland; they tried to pull it up, and it came away at once in their hands,\\r\\nfor it had no root. Stranger still, smoke began at once to ascend. The pirates\\r\\nlooked at each other. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA chimney!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they both exclaimed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground. It was the\\r\\ncustom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were in the\\r\\nneighbourhood.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNot only smoke came out of it. There came also children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voices, for so\\r\\nsafe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily chattering.\\r\\nThe pirates listened grimly, and then replaced the mushroom. They looked around\\r\\nthem and noted the holes in the seven trees.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDid you hear them say Peter Pan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s from home?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Smee\\r\\nwhispered, fidgeting with Johnny Corkscrew.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHook nodded. He stood for a long time lost in thought, and at last a curdling\\r\\nsmile lit up his swarthy face. Smee had been waiting for it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnrip your\\r\\nplan, captain,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried eagerly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo return to the ship,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hook replied slowly through his teeth,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cand cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it.\\r\\nThere can be but one room below, for there is but one chimney. The silly moles\\r\\nhad not the sense to see that they did not need a door apiece. That shows they\\r\\nhave no mother. We will leave the cake on the shore of the Mermaids\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nLagoon. These boys are always swimming about there, playing with the mermaids.\\r\\nThey will find the cake and they will gobble it up, because, having no mother,\\r\\nthey don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how dangerous \\xe2\\x80\\x99tis to eat rich damp cake.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He\\r\\nburst into laughter, not hollow laughter now, but honest laughter. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAha,\\r\\nthey will die.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSmee had listened with growing admiration.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the wickedest, prettiest policy ever I heard of!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\ncried, and in their exultation they danced and sang:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"poem\">\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAvast, belay, when I appear,<br>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0By fear they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re overtook;<br>\\r\\nNought\\xe2\\x80\\x99s left upon your bones when you<br>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0Have shaken claws with Hook.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey began the verse, but they never finished it, for another sound broke in\\r\\nand stilled them. There was at first such a tiny sound that a leaf might have\\r\\nfallen on it and smothered it, but as it came nearer it was more distinct.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTick tick tick tick!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHook stood shuddering, one foot in the air.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe crocodile!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he gasped, and bounded away, followed by his\\r\\nbo\\xe2\\x80\\x99sun.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was indeed the crocodile. It had passed the redskins, who were now on the\\r\\ntrail of the other pirates. It oozed on after Hook.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOnce more the boys emerged into the open; but the dangers of the night were not\\r\\nyet over, for presently Nibs rushed breathless into their midst, pursued by a\\r\\npack of wolves. The tongues of the pursuers were hanging out; the baying of\\r\\nthem was horrible.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSave me, save me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Nibs, falling on the ground.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut what can we do, what can we do?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their thoughts\\r\\nturned to him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat would Peter do?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they cried simultaneously.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAlmost in the same breath they cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter would look at them through\\r\\nhis legs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd then, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet us do what Peter would do.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt is quite the most successful way of defying wolves, and as one boy they bent\\r\\nand looked through their legs. The next moment is the long one, but victory\\r\\ncame quickly, for as the boys advanced upon them in the terrible attitude, the\\r\\nwolves dropped their tails and fled.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow Nibs rose from the ground, and the others thought that his staring eyes\\r\\nstill saw the wolves. But it was not wolves he saw.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have seen a wonderfuller thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried, as they gathered\\r\\nround him eagerly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA great white bird. It is flying this way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat kind of a bird, do you think?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nibs said, awestruck, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut it looks so\\r\\nweary, and as it flies it moans, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Poor Wendy.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor Wendy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI remember,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Slightly instantly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere are birds\\r\\ncalled Wendies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSee, it comes!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Curly, pointing to Wendy in the heavens.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWendy was now almost overhead, and they could hear her plaintive cry. But more\\r\\ndistinct came the shrill voice of Tinker Bell. The jealous fairy had now cast\\r\\noff all disguise of friendship, and was darting at her victim from every\\r\\ndirection, pinching savagely each time she touched.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHullo, Tink,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried the wondering boys.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTink\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reply rang out: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter wants you to shoot the Wendy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet us do\\r\\nwhat Peter wishes!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried the simple boys. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuick, bows and\\r\\narrows!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAll but Tootles popped down their trees. He had a bow and arrow with him, and\\r\\nTink noted it, and rubbed her little hands.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuick, Tootles, quick,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she screamed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter will be so\\r\\npleased.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOut of the way,\\r\\nTink,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he shouted, and then he fired, and Wendy fluttered to the ground\\r\\nwith an arrow in her breast.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"chap06\"></a>Chapter VI.<br>\\r\\nTHE LITTLE HOUSE</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFoolish Tootles was standing like a conqueror over Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s body when the\\r\\nother boys sprang, armed, from their trees.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are too late,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried proudly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have shot the Wendy.\\r\\nPeter will be so pleased with me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOverhead Tinker Bell shouted \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSilly ass!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and darted into hiding.\\r\\nThe others did not hear her.

If Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart had been beating\\r\\nthey would all have heard it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSlightly was the first to speak. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is no bird,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said in a\\r\\nscared voice. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think this must be a lady.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA lady?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Tootles, and fell a-trembling.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd we have killed her,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nibs said hoarsely.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey all whipped off their caps.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow I see,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Curly said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter was bringing her to\\r\\nus.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He threw himself sorrowfully on the ground.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA lady to take care of us at last,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one of the twins,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cand you have killed her!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey were sorry for him, but sorrier for themselves, and when he took a step\\r\\nnearer them they turned from him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTootles\\xe2\\x80\\x99 face was very white, but there was a dignity about him now that\\r\\nhad never been there before.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI did it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, reflecting. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen ladies used to come to\\r\\nme in dreams, I said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Pretty mother, pretty mother.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 But when at\\r\\nlast she really came, I shot her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe moved slowly away.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they called in pity.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he answered, shaking; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am so afraid of\\r\\nPeter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the heart of\\r\\nevery one of them rise to his mouth. They heard Peter crow.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they cried, for it was always thus that he signalled his\\r\\nreturn.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHide her,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they whispered, and gathered hastily around Wendy. But\\r\\nTootles stood aloof.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAgain came that ringing crow, and Peter dropped in front of them.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGreetings, boys,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried, and mechanically they saluted, and\\r\\nthen again was silence.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe frowned.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am back,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said hotly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhy do you not cheer?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey opened their mouths, but the cheers would not come. He overlooked it in\\r\\nhis haste to tell the glorious tidings.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGreat news, boys,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have brought at last a\\r\\nmother for you all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nStill no sound, except a little thud from Tootles as he dropped on his knees.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you not seen her?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Peter, becoming troubled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe\\r\\nflew this way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one voice said, and another said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, mournful\\r\\nday.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTootles rose. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said quietly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will show her to\\r\\nyou,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and when the others would still have hidden her he said,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBack, twins, let Peter see.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo they all stood back, and let him see, and after he had looked for a little\\r\\ntime he did not know what to do next.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe is dead,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said uncomfortably. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps she is\\r\\nfrightened at being dead.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out of sight of\\r\\nher, and then never going near the spot any more. They would all have been glad\\r\\nto follow if he had done this.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut there was the arrow. He took it from her heart and faced his band.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhose arrow?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he demanded sternly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMine, Peter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Tootles on his knees.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, dastard hand,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter said, and he raised the arrow to use it\\r\\nas a dagger.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTootles did not flinch. He bared his breast. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrike, Peter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nsaid firmly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstrike true.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTwice did Peter raise the arrow, and twice did his hand fall. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI cannot\\r\\nstrike,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said with awe, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere is something stays my\\r\\nhand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAll looked at him in wonder, save Nibs, who fortunately looked at Wendy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is she,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Wendy lady, see, her arm!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWonderful to relate, Wendy had raised her arm. Nibs bent over her and listened\\r\\nreverently. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Poor Tootles,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nwhispered.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe lives,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter said briefly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSlightly cried instantly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Wendy lady lives.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen Peter knelt beside her and found his button. You remember she had put it\\r\\non a chain that she wore round her neck.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSee,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe arrow struck against this. It is the\\r\\nkiss I gave her. It has saved her life.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI remember kisses,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Slightly interposed quickly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9clet me see\\r\\nit. Ay, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a kiss.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter did not hear him. He was begging Wendy to get better quickly, so that he\\r\\ncould show her the mermaids. Of course she could not answer yet, being still in\\r\\na frightful faint; but from overhead came a wailing note.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cListen to Tink,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Curly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe is crying because the\\r\\nWendy lives.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen they had to tell Peter of Tink\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crime, and almost never had they\\r\\nseen him look so stern.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cListen, Tinker Bell,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am your friend no more.\\r\\nBegone from me for ever.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe flew on to his shoulder and pleaded, but he brushed her off. Not until\\r\\nWendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, not\\r\\nfor ever, but for a whole week.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDo you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her arm? Oh dear no,\\r\\nnever wanted to pinch her so much. Fairies indeed are strange, and Peter, who\\r\\nunderstood them best, often cuffed them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut what to do with Wendy in her present delicate state of health?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet us carry her down into the house,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Curly suggested.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Slightly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat is what one does with\\r\\nladies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou must not touch her. It would not\\r\\nbe sufficiently respectful.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Slightly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis what I was thinking.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut if she lies there,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Tootles said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe will die.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAy, she will die,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Slightly admitted, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut there is no way\\r\\nout.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, there is,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Peter. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet us build a little house\\r\\nround her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey were all delighted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuick,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he ordered them, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbring me\\r\\neach of you the best of what we have. Gut our house. Be sharp.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding. They\\r\\nskurried this way and that, down for bedding, up for firewood, and while they\\r\\nwere at it, who should appear but John and Michael. As they dragged along the\\r\\nground they fell asleep standing, stopped, woke up, moved another step and\\r\\nslept again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJohn, John,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Michael would cry, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwake up! Where is Nana,\\r\\nJohn, and mother?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd then John would rub his eyes and mutter, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is true, we did\\r\\nfly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nYou may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHullo, Peter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHullo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Peter amicably, though he had quite forgotten\\r\\nthem. He was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet to see how\\r\\nlarge a house she would need. Of course he meant to leave room for chairs and a\\r\\ntable. John and Michael watched him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs Wendy asleep?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they asked.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJohn,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Michael proposed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9clet us wake her and get her to\\r\\nmake supper for us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on\\r\\ncarrying branches for the building of the house. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook at them!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\ncried.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCurly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Peter in his most captainy voice, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csee that\\r\\nthese boys help in the building of the house.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAy, ay, sir.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBuild a house?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exclaimed John.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor the Wendy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Curly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor Wendy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d John said, aghast. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, she is only a\\r\\ngirl!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d explained Curly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis why we are her servants.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou?

Away with them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cChairs and a fender first,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter ordered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen we shall\\r\\nbuild a house round them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Slightly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat is how a house is built; it all\\r\\ncomes back to me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter thought of everything. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSlightly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfetch a\\r\\ndoctor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAy, ay,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Slightly at once, and disappeared, scratching his\\r\\nhead. But he knew Peter must be obeyed, and he returned in a moment, wearing\\r\\nJohn\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hat and looking solemn.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlease, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Peter, going to him, \\xe2\\x80\\x9care you a\\r\\ndoctor?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that they knew\\r\\nit was make-believe, while to him make-believe and true were exactly the same\\r\\nthing. This sometimes troubled them, as when they had to make-believe that they\\r\\nhad had their dinners.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIf they broke down in their make-believe he rapped them on the knuckles.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, my little man,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Slightly anxiously replied, who had chapped\\r\\nknuckles.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlease, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter explained, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca lady lies very ill.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe was lying at their feet, but Slightly had the sense not to see her.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTut, tut, tut,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhere does she lie?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn yonder glade.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will put a glass thing in her mouth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Slightly, and he\\r\\nmade-believe to do it, while Peter waited. It was an anxious moment when the\\r\\nglass thing was withdrawn.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow is she?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d inquired Peter.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTut, tut, tut,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Slightly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis has cured her.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am glad!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter cried.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will call again in the evening,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Slightly said; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgive her\\r\\nbeef tea out of a cup with a spout to it;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but after he had returned the\\r\\nhat to John he blew big breaths, which was his habit on escaping from a\\r\\ndifficulty.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes; almost\\r\\neverything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feet.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf only we knew,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said one, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe kind of house she likes\\r\\nbest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shouted another, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshe is moving in her sleep.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHer mouth opens,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried a third, looking respectfully into it.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, lovely!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps she is going to sing in her sleep,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Peter.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWendy, sing the kind of house you would like to have.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nImmediately, without opening her eyes, Wendy began to sing:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"poem\">\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI wish I had a pretty house,<br>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0The littlest ever seen,<br>\\r\\nWith funny little red walls<br>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0And roof of mossy green.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey gurgled with joy at this, for by the greatest good luck the branches they\\r\\nhad brought were sticky with red sap, and all the ground was carpeted with\\r\\nmoss. As they rattled up the little house they broke into song themselves:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"poem\">\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve built the little walls and roof<br>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0And made a lovely door,<br>\\r\\nSo tell us, mother Wendy,<br>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0What are you wanting more?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTo this she answered greedily:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"poem\">\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, really next I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have<br>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0Gay windows all about,<br>\\r\\nWith roses peeping in, you know,<br>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0And babies peeping out.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWith a blow of their fists they made windows, and large yellow leaves were the\\r\\nblinds. But roses\\xe2\\x80\\x94?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRoses,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Peter sternly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nQuickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBabies?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTo prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song again:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"poem\">\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made the roses peeping out,<br>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0The babes are at the door,<br>\\r\\nWe cannot make ourselves, you know,<br>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x99Cos we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been made before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter, seeing this to be a good idea, at once pretended that it was his own.\\r\\nThe house was quite beautiful, and no doubt Wendy was very cosy within, though,\\r\\nof course, they could no longer see her. Peter strode up and down, ordering\\r\\nfinishing touches. Nothing escaped his eagle eyes. Just when it seemed\\r\\nabsolutely finished:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no knocker on the door,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey were very ashamed, but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe, and it made an\\r\\nexcellent knocker.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAbsolutely finished now, they thought.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNot of bit of it. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no chimney,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter said; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe\\r\\nmust have a chimney.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt certainly does need a chimney,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said John importantly. This\\r\\ngave Peter an idea. He snatched the hat off John\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head, knocked out the\\r\\nbottom, and put the hat on the roof. The little house was so pleased to have\\r\\nsuch a capital chimney that, as if to say thank you, smoke immediately began to\\r\\ncome out of the hat.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow really and truly it was finished. Nothing remained to do but to knock.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll look your best,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter warned them; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfirst impressions\\r\\nare awfully important.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe was glad no one asked him what first impressions are; they were all too busy\\r\\nlooking their best.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe knocked politely, and now the wood was as still as the children, not a sound\\r\\nto be heard except from Tinker Bell, who was watching from a branch and openly\\r\\nsneering.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhat the boys were wondering was, would any one answer the knock? If a lady,\\r\\nwhat would she be like?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe door opened and a lady came out. It was Wendy. They all whipped off their\\r\\nhats.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe looked properly surprised, and this was just how they had hoped she would\\r\\nlook.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere am I?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf course Slightly was the first to get his word in. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWendy lady,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe said rapidly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor you we built this house.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, say you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re pleased,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Nibs.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLovely, darling house,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy said, and they were the very words\\r\\nthey had hoped she would say.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd we are your children,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried the twins.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen all went on their knees, and holding out their arms cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO Wendy\\r\\nlady, be our mother.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOught I?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy said, all shining. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nfrightfully fascinating, but you see I am only a little girl. I have no real\\r\\nexperience.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Peter, as if he were the only\\r\\nperson present who knew all about it, though he was really the one who knew\\r\\nleast. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat we need is just a nice motherly person.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh dear!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou see, I feel that is exactly what\\r\\nI am.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is, it is,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they all cried; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe saw it at once.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will do my best. Come inside at\\r\\nonce, you naughty children; I am sure your feet are damp. And before I put you\\r\\nto bed I have just time to finish the story of Cinderella.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn they went; I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how there was room for them, but you can\\r\\nsqueeze very tight in the Neverland. And that was the first of the many joyous\\r\\nevenings they had with Wendy. By and by she tucked them up in the great bed in\\r\\nthe home under the trees, but she herself slept that night in the little house,\\r\\nand Peter kept watch outside with drawn sword, for the pirates could be heard\\r\\ncarousing far away and the wolves were on the prowl. The little house looked so\\r\\ncosy and safe in the darkness, with a bright light showing through its blinds,\\r\\nand the chimney smoking beautifully, and Peter standing on guard. After a time\\r\\nhe fell asleep, and some unsteady fairies had to climb over him on their way\\r\\nhome from an orgy. Any of the other boys obstructing the fairy path at night\\r\\nthey would have mischiefed, but they just tweaked Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nose and passed\\r\\non.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"chap07\"></a>Chapter VII.<br>\\r\\nTHE HOME UNDER THE GROUND</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOne of the first things Peter did next day was to measure Wendy and John and\\r\\nMichael for hollow trees. Hook, you remember, had sneered at the boys for\\r\\nthinking they needed a tree apiece, but this was ignorance, for unless your\\r\\ntree fitted you it was difficult to go up and down, and no two of the boys were\\r\\nquite the same size. Once you fitted, you drew in your breath at the top, and\\r\\ndown you went at exactly the right speed, while to ascend you drew in and let\\r\\nout alternately, and so wriggled up. Of course, when you have mastered the\\r\\naction you are able to do these things without thinking of them, and nothing\\r\\ncan be more graceful.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut you simply must fit, and Peter measures you for your tree as carefully as\\r\\nfor a suit of clothes: the only difference being that the clothes are made to\\r\\nfit you, while you have to be made to fit the tree. Usually it is done quite\\r\\neasily, as by your wearing too many garments or too few, but if you are bumpy\\r\\nin awkward places or the only available tree is an odd shape, Peter does some\\r\\nthings to you, and after that you fit. Once you fit, great care must be taken\\r\\nto go on fitting, and this, as Wendy was to discover to her delight, keeps a\\r\\nwhole family in perfect condition.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWendy and Michael fitted their trees at the first try, but John had to be\\r\\naltered a little.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAfter a few days\\xe2\\x80\\x99 practice they could go up and down as gaily as buckets\\r\\nin a well. And how ardently they grew to love their home under the ground;\\r\\nespecially Wendy. It consisted of one large room, as all houses should do, with\\r\\na floor in which you could dig if you wanted to go fishing, and in this floor\\r\\ngrew stout mushrooms of a charming colour, which were used as stools. A Never\\r\\ntree tried hard to grow in the centre of the room, but every morning they sawed\\r\\nthe trunk through, level with the floor. By tea-time it was always about two\\r\\nfeet high, and then they put a door on top of it, the whole thus becoming a\\r\\ntable; as soon as they cleared away, they sawed off the trunk again, and thus\\r\\nthere was more room to play. There was an enormous fireplace which was in\\r\\nalmost any part of the room where you cared to light it, and across this Wendy\\r\\nstretched strings, made of fibre, from which she suspended her washing. The bed\\r\\nwas tilted against the wall by day, and let down at 6:30, when it filled nearly\\r\\nhalf the room; and all the boys slept in it, except Michael, lying like\\r\\nsardines in a tin. There was a strict rule against turning round until one gave\\r\\nthe signal, when all turned at once. Michael should have used it also, but\\r\\nWendy would have a baby, and he was the littlest, and you know what women are,\\r\\nand the short and long of it is that he was hung up in a basket.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made of an\\r\\nunderground house in the same circumstances. But there was one recess in the\\r\\nwall, no larger than a bird-cage, which was the private apartment of Tinker\\r\\nBell. It could be shut off from the rest of the house by a tiny curtain, which\\r\\nTink, who was most fastidious, always kept drawn when dressing or undressing.\\r\\nNo woman, however large, could have had a more exquisite boudoir and\\r\\nbed-chamber combined. The couch, as she always called it, was a genuine Queen\\r\\nMab, with club legs; and she varied the bedspreads according to what\\r\\nfruit-blossom was in season. Her mirror was a Puss-in-Boots, of which there are\\r\\nnow only three, unchipped, known to fairy dealers; the washstand was Pie-crust\\r\\nand reversible, the chest of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth, and the\\r\\ncarpet and rugs the best (the early) period of Margery and Robin. There was a\\r\\nchandelier from Tiddlywinks for the look of the thing, but of course she lit\\r\\nthe residence herself. Tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house, as\\r\\nindeed was perhaps inevitable, and her chamber, though beautiful, looked rather\\r\\nconceited, having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy, because those rampagious\\r\\nboys of hers gave her so much to do. Really there were whole weeks when, except\\r\\nperhaps with a stocking in the evening, she was never above ground. The\\r\\ncooking, I can tell you, kept her nose to the pot, and even if there was\\r\\nnothing in it, even if there was no pot, she had to keep watching that it came\\r\\naboil just the same. You never exactly knew whether there would be a real meal\\r\\nor just a make-believe, it all depended upon Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s whim: he could eat,\\r\\nreally eat, if it was part of a game, but he could not stodge just to feel\\r\\nstodgy, which is what most children like better than anything else; the next\\r\\nbest thing being to talk about it. Make-believe was so real to him that during\\r\\na meal of it you could see him getting rounder. Of course it was trying, but\\r\\nyou simply had to follow his lead, and if you could prove to him that you were\\r\\ngetting loose for your tree he let you stodge.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all gone\\r\\nto bed. Then, as she expressed it, she had a breathing time for herself; and\\r\\nshe occupied it in making new things for them, and putting double pieces on the\\r\\nknees, for they were all most frightfully hard on their knees.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen she sat down to a basketful of their stockings, every heel with a hole in\\r\\nit, she would fling up her arms and exclaim, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh dear, I am sure I\\r\\nsometimes think spinsters are to be envied!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHer face beamed when she exclaimed this.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nYou remember about her pet wolf. Well, it very soon discovered that she had\\r\\ncome to the island and it found her out, and they just ran into each\\r\\nother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arms. After that it followed her about everywhere.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she had left\\r\\nbehind her? This is a difficult question, because it is quite impossible to say\\r\\nhow time does wear on in the Neverland, where it is calculated by moons and\\r\\nsuns, and there are ever so many more of them than on the mainland. But I am\\r\\nafraid that Wendy did not really worry about her father and mother; she was\\r\\nabsolutely confident that they would always keep the window open for her to fly\\r\\nback by, and this gave her complete ease of mind. What did disturb her at times\\r\\nwas that John remembered his parents vaguely only, as people he had once known,\\r\\nwhile Michael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother.\\r\\nThese things scared her a little, and nobly anxious to do her duty, she tried\\r\\nto fix the old life in their minds by setting them examination papers on it, as\\r\\nlike as possible to the ones she used to do at school. The other boys thought\\r\\nthis awfully interesting, and insisted on joining, and they made slates for\\r\\nthemselves, and sat round the table, writing and thinking hard about the\\r\\nquestions she had written on another slate and passed round. They were the most\\r\\nordinary questions\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat was the colour of Mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes?\\r\\nWhich was taller, Father or Mother? Was Mother blonde or brunette? Answer all\\r\\nthree questions if possible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9c(A) Write an essay of not less than\\r\\n40 words on How I spent my last Holidays, or The Characters of Father and\\r\\nMother compared. Only one of these to be attempted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Or \\xe2\\x80\\x9c(1)\\r\\nDescribe Mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s laugh; (2) Describe Father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s laugh; (3) Describe\\r\\nMother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Party Dress; (4) Describe the Kennel and its Inmate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey were just everyday questions like these, and when you could not answer\\r\\nthem you were told to make a cross; and it was really dreadful what a number of\\r\\ncrosses even John made. Of course the only boy who replied to every question\\r\\nwas Slightly, and no one could have been more hopeful of coming out first, but\\r\\nhis answers were perfectly ridiculous, and he really came out last: a\\r\\nmelancholy thing.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter did not compete. For one thing he despised all mothers except Wendy, and\\r\\nfor another he was the only boy on the island who could neither write nor\\r\\nspell; not the smallest word. He was above all that sort of thing.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy the way, the questions were all written in the past tense. What was the\\r\\ncolour of Mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes, and so on. Wendy, you see, had been forgetting,\\r\\ntoo.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAdventures, of course, as we shall see, were of daily occurrence; but about\\r\\nthis time Peter invented, with Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s help, a new game that fascinated\\r\\nhim enormously, until he suddenly had no more interest in it, which, as you\\r\\nhave been told, was what always happened with his games. It consisted in\\r\\npretending not to have adventures, in doing the sort of thing John and Michael\\r\\nhad been doing all their lives, sitting on stools flinging balls in the air,\\r\\npushing each other, going out for walks and coming back without having killed\\r\\nso much as a grizzly. To see Peter doing nothing on a stool was a great sight;\\r\\nhe could not help looking solemn at such times, to sit still seemed to him such\\r\\na comic thing to do. He boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his\\r\\nhealth. For several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to him;\\r\\nand John and Michael had to pretend to be delighted also; otherwise he would\\r\\nhave treated them severely.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe often went out alone, and when he came back you were never absolutely\\r\\ncertain whether he had had an adventure or not. He might have forgotten it so\\r\\ncompletely that he said nothing about it; and then when you went out you found\\r\\nthe body; and, on the other hand, he might say a great deal about it, and yet\\r\\nyou could not find the body. Sometimes he came home with his head bandaged, and\\r\\nthen Wendy cooed over him and bathed it in lukewarm water, while he told a\\r\\ndazzling tale. But she was never quite sure, you know. There were, however,\\r\\nmany adventures which she knew to be true because she was in them herself, and\\r\\nthere were still more that were at least partly true, for the other boys were\\r\\nin them and said they were wholly true. To describe them all would require a\\r\\nbook as large as an English-Latin, Latin-English Dictionary, and the most we\\r\\ncan do is to give one as a specimen of an average hour on the island. The\\r\\ndifficulty is which one to choose. Should we take the brush with the redskins\\r\\nat Slightly Gulch? It was a sanguinary affair, and especially interesting as\\r\\nshowing one of Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s peculiarities, which was that in the middle of a\\r\\nfight he would suddenly change sides. At the Gulch, when victory was still in\\r\\nthe balance, sometimes leaning this way and sometimes that, he called out,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m redskin to-day; what are you, Tootles?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And Tootles\\r\\nanswered, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRedskin; what are you, Nibs?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and Nibs said,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRedskin; what are you Twin?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and so on; and they were all\\r\\nredskins; and of course this would have ended the fight had not the real\\r\\nredskins fascinated by Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s methods, agreed to be lost boys for that\\r\\nonce, and so at it they all went again, more fiercely than ever.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe extraordinary upshot of this adventure was\\xe2\\x80\\x94but we have not decided\\r\\nyet that this is the adventure we are to narrate. Perhaps a better one would be\\r\\nthe night attack by the redskins on the house under the ground, when several of\\r\\nthem stuck in the hollow trees and had to be pulled out like corks. Or we might\\r\\ntell how Peter saved Tiger Lily\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life in the Mermaids\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Lagoon, and\\r\\nso made her his ally.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOr we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might eat it\\r\\nand perish; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after another; but\\r\\nalways Wendy snatched it from the hands of her children, so that in time it\\r\\nlost its succulence, and became as hard as a stone, and was used as a missile,\\r\\nand Hook fell over it in the dark.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOr suppose we tell of the birds that were Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s friends, particularly\\r\\nof the Never bird that built in a tree overhanging the lagoon, and how the nest\\r\\nfell into the water, and still the bird sat on her eggs, and Peter gave orders\\r\\nthat she was not to be disturbed. That is a pretty story, and the end shows how\\r\\ngrateful a bird can be; but if we tell it we must also tell the whole adventure\\r\\nof the lagoon, which would of course be telling two adventures rather than just\\r\\none. A shorter adventure, and quite as exciting, was Tinker Bell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nattempt, with the help of some street fairies, to have the sleeping Wendy\\r\\nconveyed on a great floating leaf to the mainland. Fortunately the leaf gave\\r\\nway and Wendy woke, thinking it was bath-time, and swam back. Or again, we\\r\\nmight choose Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s defiance of the lions, when he drew a circle round\\r\\nhim on the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it; and though he\\r\\nwaited for hours, with the other boys and Wendy looking on breathlessly from\\r\\ntrees, not one of them dared to accept his challenge.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhich of these adventures shall we choose? The best way will be to toss for it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI have tossed, and the lagoon has won. This almost makes one wish that the\\r\\ngulch or the cake or Tink\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leaf had won. Of course I could do it again,\\r\\nand make it best out of three; however, perhaps fairest to stick to the lagoon.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"chap08\"></a>Chapter VIII.<br>\\r\\nTHE MERMAIDS\\xe2\\x80\\x99 LAGOON</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIf you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times a shapeless\\r\\npool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness; then if you squeeze your\\r\\neyes tighter, the pool begins to take shape, and the colours become so vivid\\r\\nthat with another squeeze they must go on fire. But just before they go on fire\\r\\nyou see the lagoon. This is the nearest you ever get to it on the mainland,\\r\\njust one heavenly moment; if there could be two moments you might see the surf\\r\\nand hear the mermaids singing.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or floating\\r\\nmost of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water, and so forth. You\\r\\nmust not think from this that the mermaids were on friendly terms with them: on\\r\\nthe contrary, it was among Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lasting regrets that all the time she\\r\\nwas on the island she never had a civil word from one of them. When she stole\\r\\nsoftly to the edge of the lagoon she might see them by the score, especially on\\r\\nMarooners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Rock, where they loved to bask, combing out their hair in a\\r\\nlazy way that quite irritated her; or she might even swim, on tiptoe as it\\r\\nwere, to within a yard of them, but then they saw her and dived, probably\\r\\nsplashing her with their tails, not by accident, but intentionally.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey treated all the boys in the same way, except of course Peter, who chatted\\r\\nwith them on Marooners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Rock by the hour, and sat on their tails when\\r\\nthey got cheeky. He gave Wendy one of their combs.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon, when\\r\\nthey utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for mortals then,\\r\\nand until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy had never seen the\\r\\nlagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course Peter would have accompanied\\r\\nher, than because she had strict rules about every one being in bed by seven.\\r\\nShe was often at the lagoon, however, on sunny days after rain, when the\\r\\nmermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles. The\\r\\nbubbles of many colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them\\r\\ngaily from one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in the\\r\\nrainbow till they burst. The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and the\\r\\nkeepers only are allowed to use their hands. Sometimes a dozen of these games\\r\\nwill be going on in the lagoon at a time, and it is quite a pretty sight.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by themselves,\\r\\nfor the mermaids immediately disappeared. Nevertheless we have proof that they\\r\\nsecretly watched the interlopers, and were not above taking an idea from them;\\r\\nfor John introduced a new way of hitting the bubble, with the head instead of\\r\\nthe hand, and the mermaids adopted it. This is the one mark that John has left\\r\\non the Neverland.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a rock for\\r\\nhalf an hour after their mid-day meal. Wendy insisted on their doing this, and\\r\\nit had to be a real rest even though the meal was make-believe. So they lay\\r\\nthere in the sun, and their bodies glistened in it, while she sat beside them\\r\\nand looked important.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was one such day, and they were all on Marooners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Rock. The rock was\\r\\nnot much larger than their great bed, but of course they all knew how not to\\r\\ntake up much room, and they were dozing, or at least lying with their eyes\\r\\nshut, and pinching occasionally when they thought Wendy was not looking. She\\r\\nwas very busy, stitching.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhile she stitched a change came to the lagoon. Little shivers ran over it, and\\r\\nthe sun went away and shadows stole across the water, turning it cold. Wendy\\r\\ncould no longer see to thread her needle, and when she looked up, the lagoon\\r\\nthat had always hitherto been such a laughing place seemed formidable and\\r\\nunfriendly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was not, she knew, that night had come, but something as dark as night had\\r\\ncome. No, worse than that. It had not come, but it had sent that shiver through\\r\\nthe sea to say that it was coming. What was it?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere crowded upon her all the stories she had been told of Marooners\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nRock, so called because evil captains put sailors on it and leave them there to\\r\\ndrown. They drown when the tide rises, for then it is submerged.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf course she should have roused the children at once; not merely because of\\r\\nthe unknown that was stalking toward them, but because it was no longer good\\r\\nfor them to sleep on a rock grown chilly. But she was a young mother and she\\r\\ndid not know this; she thought you simply must stick to your rule about half an\\r\\nhour after the mid-day meal. So, though fear was upon her, and she longed to\\r\\nhear male voices, she would not waken them. Even when she heard the sound of\\r\\nmuffled oars, though her heart was in her mouth, she did not waken them. She\\r\\nstood over them to let them have their sleep out. Was it not brave of Wendy?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was well for those boys then that there was one among them who could sniff\\r\\ndanger even in his sleep. Peter sprang erect, as wide awake at once as a dog,\\r\\nand with one warning cry he roused the others.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe stood motionless, one hand to his ear.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPirates!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried. The others came closer to him. A strange smile\\r\\nwas playing about his face, and Wendy saw it and shuddered. While that smile\\r\\nwas on his face no one dared address him; all they could do was to stand ready\\r\\nto obey. The order came sharp and incisive.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDive!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere was a gleam of legs, and instantly the lagoon seemed deserted.\\r\\nMarooners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Rock stood alone in the forbidding waters as if it were itself\\r\\nmarooned.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe boat drew nearer. It was the pirate dinghy, with three figures in her, Smee\\r\\nand Starkey, and the third a captive, no other than Tiger Lily. Her hands and\\r\\nankles were tied, and she knew what was to be her fate. She was to be left on\\r\\nthe rock to perish, an end to one of her race more terrible than death by fire\\r\\nor torture, for is it not written in the book of the tribe that there is no\\r\\npath through water to the happy hunting-ground? Yet her face was impassive; she\\r\\nwas the daughter of a chief, she must die as a chief\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daughter, it is\\r\\nenough.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey had caught her boarding the pirate ship with a knife in her mouth. No\\r\\nwatch was kept on the ship, it being Hook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s boast that the wind of his\\r\\nname guarded the ship for a mile around. Now her fate would help to guard it\\r\\nalso. One more wail would go the round in that wind by night.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the gloom that they brought with them the two pirates did not see the rock\\r\\ntill they crashed into it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLuff, you lubber,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried an Irish voice that was Smee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s;\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the rock. Now, then, what we have to do is to hoist the\\r\\nredskin on to it and leave her here to drown.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl on the rock;\\r\\nshe was too proud to offer a vain resistance.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nQuite near the rock, but out of sight, two heads were bobbing up and down,\\r\\nPeter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. Wendy was crying, for it was the first tragedy\\r\\nshe had seen. Peter had seen many tragedies, but he had forgotten them all. He\\r\\nwas less sorry than Wendy for Tiger Lily: it was two against one that angered\\r\\nhim, and he meant to save her. An easy way would have been to wait until the\\r\\npirates had gone, but he was never one to choose the easy way.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere was almost nothing he could not do, and he now imitated the voice of\\r\\nHook.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAhoy there, you lubbers!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he called. It was a marvellous\\r\\nimitation.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe captain!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the pirates, staring at each other in surprise.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe must be swimming out to us,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Starkey said, when they had looked\\r\\nfor him in vain.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are putting the redskin on the rock,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Smee called out.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSet her free,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d came the astonishing answer.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFree!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, cut her bonds and let her go.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, captain\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt once, d\\xe2\\x80\\x99ye hear,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Peter, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cor I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll\\r\\nplunge my hook in you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis is queer!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Smee gasped.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBetter do what the captain orders,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Starkey nervously.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAy, ay,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Smee said, and he cut Tiger Lily\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cords. At once\\r\\nlike an eel she slid between Starkey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legs into the water.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf course Wendy was very elated over Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cleverness; but she knew\\r\\nthat he would be elated also and very likely crow and thus betray himself, so\\r\\nat once her hand went out to cover his mouth. But it was stayed even in the\\r\\nact, for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBoat ahoy!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rang over the lagoon in Hook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice,\\r\\nand this time it was not Peter who had spoken.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter may have been about to crow, but his face puckered in a whistle of\\r\\nsurprise instead.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBoat ahoy!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d again came the voice.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow Wendy understood. The real Hook was also in the water.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe was swimming to the boat, and as his men showed a light to guide him he had\\r\\nsoon reached them. In the light of the lantern Wendy saw his hook grip the\\r\\nboat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side; she saw his evil swarthy face as he rose dripping from the\\r\\nwater, and, quaking, she would have liked to swim away, but Peter would not\\r\\nbudge. He was tingling with life and also top-heavy with conceit. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAm I\\r\\nnot a wonder, oh, I am a wonder!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he whispered to her, and though she\\r\\nthought so also, she was really glad for the sake of his reputation that no one\\r\\nheard him except herself.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe signed to her to listen.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe two pirates were very curious to know what had brought their captain to\\r\\nthem, but he sat with his head on his hook in a position of profound\\r\\nmelancholy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCaptain, is all well?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they asked timidly, but he answered with a\\r\\nhollow moan.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe sighs,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Smee.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe sighs again,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Starkey.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd yet a third time he sighs,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Smee.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen at last he spoke passionately.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe game\\xe2\\x80\\x99s up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthose boys have found a\\r\\nmother.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAffrighted though she was, Wendy swelled with pride.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cO evil day!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Starkey.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a mother?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked the ignorant Smee.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWendy was so shocked that she exclaimed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nand always after this she felt that if you could have a pet pirate Smee would\\r\\nbe her one.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter pulled her beneath the water, for Hook had started up, crying,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat was that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI heard nothing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Starkey, raising the lantern over the\\r\\nwaters, and as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight. It was the nest I\\r\\nhave told you of, floating on the lagoon, and the Never bird was sitting on it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSee,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Hook in answer to Smee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s question, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat is\\r\\na mother. What a lesson! The nest must have fallen into the water, but would\\r\\nthe mother desert her eggs? No.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere was a break in his voice, as if for a moment he recalled innocent days\\r\\nwhen\\xe2\\x80\\x94but he brushed away this weakness with his hook.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSmee, much impressed, gazed at the bird as the nest was borne past, but the\\r\\nmore suspicious Starkey said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf she is a mother, perhaps she is hanging\\r\\nabout here to help Peter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHook winced. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat is the fear that haunts\\r\\nme.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe was roused from this dejection by Smee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eager voice.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCaptain,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Smee, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccould we not kidnap these boys\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\r\\nmother and make her our mother?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a princely scheme,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Hook, and at once it took\\r\\npractical shape in his great brain. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe will seize the children and carry\\r\\nthem to the boat: the boys we will make walk the plank, and Wendy shall be our\\r\\nmother.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAgain Wendy forgot herself.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNever!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, and bobbed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat was that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut they could see nothing. They thought it must have been a leaf in the wind.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you agree, my bullies?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Hook.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is my hand on it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they both said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd there is my hook. Swear.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey all swore. By this time they were on the rock, and suddenly Hook\\r\\nremembered Tiger Lily.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere is the redskin?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he demanded abruptly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe had a playful humour at moments, and they thought this was one of the\\r\\nmoments.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is all right, captain,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Smee answered complacently; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe\\r\\nlet her go.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet her go!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Hook.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99Twas your own orders,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the bo\\xe2\\x80\\x99sun faltered.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou called over the water to us to let her go,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Starkey.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBrimstone and gall,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thundered Hook, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat cozening is going\\r\\non here!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d His face had gone black with rage, but he saw that they\\r\\nbelieved their words, and he was startled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLads,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, shaking\\r\\na little, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI gave no such order.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is passing queer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Smee said, and they all fidgeted\\r\\nuncomfortably. Hook raised his voice, but there was a quiver in it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSpirit that haunts this dark lagoon to-night,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cdost hear me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf course Peter should have kept quiet, but of course he did not.

He saw his men draw back from him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave we been captained all this time by a codfish!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they muttered.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is lowering to our pride.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey were his dogs snapping at him, but, tragic figure though he had become, he\\r\\nscarcely heeded them. Against such fearful evidence it was not their belief in\\r\\nhim that he needed, it was his own. He felt his ego slipping from him.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t desert me, bully,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he whispered hoarsely to it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn his dark nature there was a touch of the feminine, as in all the great\\r\\npirates, and it sometimes gave him intuitions.

Take him dead or alive!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe leaped as he spoke, and simultaneously came the gay voice of Peter.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you ready, boys?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAy, ay,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from various parts of the lagoon.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen lam into the pirates.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe fight was short and sharp. First to draw blood was John, who gallantly\\r\\nclimbed into the boat and held Starkey. There was fierce struggle, in which the\\r\\ncutlass was torn from the pirate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grasp. He wriggled overboard and John\\r\\nleapt after him. The dinghy drifted away.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHere and there a head bobbed up in the water, and there was a flash of steel\\r\\nfollowed by a cry or a whoop. In the confusion some struck at their own side.\\r\\nThe corkscrew of Smee got Tootles in the fourth rib, but he was himself pinked\\r\\nin turn by Curly. Farther from the rock Starkey was pressing Slightly and the\\r\\ntwins hard.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhere all this time was Peter? He was seeking bigger game.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe others were all brave boys, and they must not be blamed for backing from\\r\\nthe pirate captain. His iron claw made a circle of dead water round him, from\\r\\nwhich they fled like affrighted fishes.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut there was one who did not fear him: there was one prepared to enter that\\r\\ncircle.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nStrangely, it was not in the water that they met. Hook rose to the rock to\\r\\nbreathe, and at the same moment Peter scaled it on the opposite side. The rock\\r\\nwas slippery as a ball, and they had to crawl rather than climb. Neither knew\\r\\nthat the other was coming. Each feeling for a grip met the other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arm:\\r\\nin surprise they raised their heads; their faces were almost touching; so they\\r\\nmet.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSome of the greatest heroes have confessed that just before they fell to they\\r\\nhad a sinking. Had it been so with Peter at that moment I would admit it. After\\r\\nall, he was the only man that the Sea-Cook had feared. But Peter had no\\r\\nsinking, he had one feeling only, gladness; and he gnashed his pretty teeth\\r\\nwith joy. Quick as thought he snatched a knife from Hook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s belt and was\\r\\nabout to drive it home, when he saw that he was higher up the rock than his\\r\\nfoe. It would not have been fighting fair. He gave the pirate a hand to help\\r\\nhim up.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was then that Hook bit him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNot the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed Peter. It made him quite\\r\\nhelpless. He could only stare, horrified. Every child is affected thus the\\r\\nfirst time he is treated unfairly. All he thinks he has a right to when he\\r\\ncomes to you to be yours is fairness. After you have been unfair to him he will\\r\\nlove you again, but will never afterwards be quite the same boy. No one ever\\r\\ngets over the first unfairness; no one except Peter. He often met it, but he\\r\\nalways forgot it. I suppose that was the real difference between him and all\\r\\nthe rest.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo when he met it now it was like the first time; and he could just stare,\\r\\nhelpless. Twice the iron hand clawed him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA few moments afterwards the other boys saw Hook in the water striking wildly\\r\\nfor the ship; no elation on the pestilent face now, only white fear, for the\\r\\ncrocodile was in dogged pursuit of him. On ordinary occasions the boys would\\r\\nhave swum alongside cheering; but now they were uneasy, for they had lost both\\r\\nPeter and Wendy, and were scouring the lagoon for them, calling them by name.\\r\\nThey found the dinghy and went home in it, shouting \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter, Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nas they went, but no answer came save mocking laughter from the mermaids.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey must be swimming back or flying,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the boys concluded. They\\r\\nwere not very anxious, because they had such faith in Peter. They chuckled,\\r\\nboylike, because they would be late for bed; and it was all mother\\r\\nWendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fault!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen their voices died away there came cold silence over the lagoon, and then a\\r\\nfeeble cry.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHelp, help!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTwo small figures were beating against the rock; the girl had fainted and lay\\r\\non the boy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arm. With a last effort Peter pulled her up the rock and\\r\\nthen lay down beside her. Even as he also fainted he saw that the water was\\r\\nrising. He knew that they would soon be drowned, but he could do no more.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs they lay side by side a mermaid caught Wendy by the feet, and began pulling\\r\\nher softly into the water. Peter, feeling her slip from him, woke with a start,\\r\\nand was just in time to draw her back. But he had to tell her the truth.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are on the rock, Wendy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut it is growing\\r\\nsmaller. Soon the water will be over it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe did not understand even now.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe must go,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, almost brightly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he answered faintly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShall we swim or fly, Peter?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe had to tell her.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you think you could swim or fly as far as the island, Wendy, without\\r\\nmy help?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe had to admit that she was too tired.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe moaned.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked, anxious about him at once.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help you, Wendy. Hook wounded me. I can neither fly nor\\r\\nswim.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you mean we shall both be drowned?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLook how the water is rising.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey put their hands over their eyes to shut out the sight. They thought they\\r\\nwould soon be no more. As they sat thus something brushed against Peter as\\r\\nlight as a kiss, and stayed there, as if saying timidly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCan I be of any\\r\\nuse?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was the tail of a kite, which Michael had made some days before. It had torn\\r\\nitself out of his hand and floated away.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMichael\\xe2\\x80\\x99s kite,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter said without interest, but next\\r\\nmoment he had seized the tail, and was pulling the kite toward him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt lifted Michael off the ground,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhy should it\\r\\nnot carry you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBoth of us!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lift two; Michael and Curly tried.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet us draw lots,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy said bravely.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd you a lady; never.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Already he had tied the tail round her.\\r\\nShe clung to him; she refused to go without him; but with a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood-bye,\\r\\nWendy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he pushed her from the rock; and in a few minutes she was borne\\r\\nout of his sight. Peter was alone on the lagoon.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe rock was very small now; soon it would be submerged. Pale rays of light\\r\\ntiptoed across the waters; and by and by there was to be heard a sound at once\\r\\nthe most musical and the most melancholy in the world: the mermaids calling to\\r\\nthe moon.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter was not quite like other boys; but he was afraid at last. A tremour ran\\r\\nthrough him, like a shudder passing over the sea; but on the sea one shudder\\r\\nfollows another till there are hundreds of them, and Peter felt just the one.\\r\\nNext moment he was standing erect on the rock again, with that smile on his\\r\\nface and a drum beating within him. It was saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo die will be an\\r\\nawfully big adventure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"chap09\"></a>Chapter IX.<br>\\r\\nTHE NEVER BIRD</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe last sound Peter heard before he was quite alone were the mermaids retiring\\r\\none by one to their bedchambers under the sea. He was too far away to hear\\r\\ntheir doors shut; but every door in the coral caves where they live rings a\\r\\ntiny bell when it opens or closes (as in all the nicest houses on the\\r\\nmainland), and he heard the bells.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSteadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his feet; and to pass the\\r\\ntime until they made their final gulp, he watched the only thing on the lagoon.\\r\\nHe thought it was a piece of floating paper, perhaps part of the kite, and\\r\\nwondered idly how long it would take to drift ashore.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPresently he noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out upon the\\r\\nlagoon with some definite purpose, for it was fighting the tide, and sometimes\\r\\nwinning; and when it won, Peter, always sympathetic to the weaker side, could\\r\\nnot help clapping; it was such a gallant piece of paper.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was not really a piece of paper; it was the Never bird, making desperate\\r\\nefforts to reach Peter on the nest. By working her wings, in a way she had\\r\\nlearned since the nest fell into the water, she was able to some extent to\\r\\nguide her strange craft, but by the time Peter recognised her she was very\\r\\nexhausted. She had come to save him, to give him her nest, though there were\\r\\neggs in it. I rather wonder at the bird, for though he had been nice to her, he\\r\\nhad also sometimes tormented her. I can suppose only that, like Mrs. Darling\\r\\nand the rest of them, she was melted because he had all his first teeth.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe called out to him what she had come for, and he called out to her what she\\r\\nwas doing there; but of course neither of them understood the other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nlanguage. In fanciful stories people can talk to the birds freely, and I wish\\r\\nfor the moment I could pretend that this were such a story, and say that Peter\\r\\nreplied intelligently to the Never bird; but truth is best, and I want to tell\\r\\nyou only what really happened. Well, not only could they not understand each\\r\\nother, but they forgot their manners.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x94want\\xe2\\x80\\x94you\\xe2\\x80\\x94to\\xe2\\x80\\x94get\\xe2\\x80\\x94into\\xe2\\x80\\x94the\\xe2\\x80\\x94nest,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nthe bird called, speaking as slowly and distinctly as possible,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cand\\xe2\\x80\\x94then\\xe2\\x80\\x94you\\xe2\\x80\\x94can\\xe2\\x80\\x94drift\\xe2\\x80\\x94ashore,\\r\\nbut\\xe2\\x80\\x94I\\xe2\\x80\\x94am\\xe2\\x80\\x94too\\xe2\\x80\\x94tired\\xe2\\x80\\x94to\\xe2\\x80\\x94bring\\xe2\\x80\\x94it\\xe2\\x80\\x94any\\xe2\\x80\\x94nearer\\xe2\\x80\\x94so\\xe2\\x80\\x94you\\xe2\\x80\\x94must\\xe2\\x80\\x94try\\r\\nto\\xe2\\x80\\x94swim\\xe2\\x80\\x94to\\xe2\\x80\\x94it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat are you quacking about?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy\\r\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you let the nest drift as usual?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x94want\\xe2\\x80\\x94you\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the bird said, and repeated it all\\r\\nover.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen Peter tried slow and distinct.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x94are\\xe2\\x80\\x94you\\xe2\\x80\\x94quacking\\xe2\\x80\\x94about?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and so on.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Never bird became irritated; they have very short tempers.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou dunderheaded little jay!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she screamed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nyou do as I tell you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter felt that she was calling him names, and at a venture he retorted hotly:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo are you!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen rather curiously they both snapped out the same remark:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShut up!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShut up!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNevertheless the bird was determined to save him if she could, and by one last\\r\\nmighty effort she propelled the nest against the rock. Then up she flew;\\r\\ndeserting her eggs, so as to make her meaning clear.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen at last he understood, and clutched the nest and waved his thanks to the\\r\\nbird as she fluttered overhead. It was not to receive his thanks, however, that\\r\\nshe hung there in the sky; it was not even to watch him get into the nest; it\\r\\nwas to see what he did with her eggs.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere were two large white eggs, and Peter lifted them up and reflected. The\\r\\nbird covered her face with her wings, so as not to see the last of them; but\\r\\nshe could not help peeping between the feathers.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI forget whether I have told you that there was a stave on the rock, driven\\r\\ninto it by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the site of buried treasure. The\\r\\nchildren had discovered the glittering hoard, and when in a mischievous mood\\r\\nused to fling showers of moidores, diamonds, pearls and pieces of eight to the\\r\\ngulls, who pounced upon them for food, and then flew away, raging at the scurvy\\r\\ntrick that had been played upon them. The stave was still there, and on it\\r\\nStarkey had hung his hat, a deep tarpaulin, watertight, with a broad brim.\\r\\nPeter put the eggs into this hat and set it on the lagoon. It floated\\r\\nbeautifully.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Never bird saw at once what he was up to, and screamed her admiration of\\r\\nhim; and, alas, Peter crowed his agreement with her. Then he got into the nest,\\r\\nreared the stave in it as a mast, and hung up his shirt for a sail. At the same\\r\\nmoment the bird fluttered down upon the hat and once more sat snugly on her\\r\\neggs. She drifted in one direction, and he was borne off in another, both\\r\\ncheering.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf course when Peter landed he beached his barque in a place where the bird\\r\\nwould easily find it; but the hat was such a great success that she abandoned\\r\\nthe nest. It drifted about till it went to pieces, and often Starkey came to\\r\\nthe shore of the lagoon, and with many bitter feelings watched the bird sitting\\r\\non his hat. As we shall not see her again, it may be worth mentioning here that\\r\\nall Never birds now build in that shape of nest, with a broad brim on which the\\r\\nyoungsters take an airing.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nGreat were the rejoicings when Peter reached the home under the ground almost\\r\\nas soon as Wendy, who had been carried hither and thither by the kite. Every\\r\\nboy had adventures to tell; but perhaps the biggest adventure of all was that\\r\\nthey were several hours late for bed. This so inflated them that they did\\r\\nvarious dodgy things to get staying up still longer, such as demanding\\r\\nbandages; but Wendy, though glorying in having them all home again safe and\\r\\nsound, was scandalised by the lateness of the hour, and cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo bed,\\r\\nto bed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in a voice that had to be obeyed. Next day, however, she was\\r\\nawfully tender, and gave out bandages to every one, and they played till\\r\\nbed-time at limping about and carrying their arms in slings.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"chap10\"></a>Chapter X.<br>\\r\\nTHE HAPPY HOME</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOne important result of the brush on the lagoon was that it made the redskins\\r\\ntheir friends. Peter had saved Tiger Lily from a dreadful fate, and now there\\r\\nwas nothing she and her braves would not do for him. All night they sat above,\\r\\nkeeping watch over the home under the ground and awaiting the big attack by the\\r\\npirates which obviously could not be much longer delayed. Even by day they hung\\r\\nabout, smoking the pipe of peace, and looking almost as if they wanted tit-bits\\r\\nto eat.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey called Peter the Great White Father, prostrating themselves before him;\\r\\nand he liked this tremendously, so that it was not really good for him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe great white father,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he would say to them in a very lordly\\r\\nmanner, as they grovelled at his feet, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis glad to see the Piccaninny\\r\\nwarriors protecting his wigwam from the pirates.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMe Tiger Lily,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that lovely creature would reply. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter Pan\\r\\nsave me, me his velly nice friend. Me no let pirates hurt him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe was far too pretty to cringe in this way, but Peter thought it his due, and\\r\\nhe would answer condescendingly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is good. Peter Pan has\\r\\nspoken.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAlways when he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter Pan has spoken,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it meant that they\\r\\nmust now shut up, and they accepted it humbly in that spirit; but they were by\\r\\nno means so respectful to the other boys, whom they looked upon as just\\r\\nordinary braves. They said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow-do?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to them, and things like that;\\r\\nand what annoyed the boys was that Peter seemed to think this all right.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSecretly Wendy sympathised with them a little, but she was far too loyal a\\r\\nhousewife to listen to any complaints against father. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFather knows\\r\\nbest,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she always said, whatever her private opinion must be. Her private\\r\\nopinion was that the redskins should not call her a squaw.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWe have now reached the evening that was to be known among them as the Night of\\r\\nNights, because of its adventures and their upshot. The day, as if quietly\\r\\ngathering its forces, had been almost uneventful, and now the redskins in their\\r\\nblankets were at their posts above, while, below, the children were having\\r\\ntheir evening meal; all except Peter, who had gone out to get the time. The way\\r\\nyou got the time on the island was to find the crocodile, and then stay near\\r\\nhim till the clock struck.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe meal happened to be a make-believe tea, and they sat around the board,\\r\\nguzzling in their greed; and really, what with their chatter and\\r\\nrecriminations, the noise, as Wendy said, was positively deafening. To be sure,\\r\\nshe did not mind noise, but she simply would not have them grabbing things, and\\r\\nthen excusing themselves by saying that Tootles had pushed their elbow. There\\r\\nwas a fixed rule that they must never hit back at meals, but should refer the\\r\\nmatter of dispute to Wendy by raising the right arm politely and saying,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI complain of so-and-so;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but what usually happened was that they\\r\\nforgot to do this or did it too much.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSilence,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Wendy when for the twentieth time she had told\\r\\nthem that they were not all to speak at once. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs your mug empty,\\r\\nSlightly darling?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot quite empty, mummy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Slightly said, after looking into an\\r\\nimaginary mug.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even begun to drink his milk,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nibs interposed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThis was telling, and Slightly seized his chance.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI complain of Nibs,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried promptly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nJohn, however, had held up his hand first.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, John?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMay I sit in Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chair, as he is not here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSit in father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chair, John!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy was scandalised.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is not really our father,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d John answered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\r\\ndidn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know how a father does till I showed him.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThis was grumbling. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe complain of John,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried the twins.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTootles held up his hand.

It had become a very familiar scene, this,\\r\\nin the home under the ground, but we are looking on it for the last time.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere was a step above, and Wendy, you may be sure, was the first to recognize\\r\\nit.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cChildren, I hear your father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s step.

I have spoken.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd then, as so often before, the gay children dragged him from his tree. As so\\r\\noften before, but never again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe had brought nuts for the boys as well as the correct time for Wendy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter, you just spoil them, you know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy simpered.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh, old lady,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Peter, hanging up his gun.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was me told him mothers are called old lady,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Michael whispered\\r\\nto Curly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI complain of Michael,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Curly instantly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe first twin came to Peter. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFather, we want to dance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDance away, my little man,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Peter, who was in high good\\r\\nhumour.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut we want you to dance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter was really the best dancer among them, but he pretended to be\\r\\nscandalised.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMe!

Now\\r\\nwe know why she was prejudiced against the redskins.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen what is it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t for a lady to tell.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, very well,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter said, a little nettled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps\\r\\nTinker Bell will tell me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh yes, Tinker Bell will tell you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy retorted scornfully.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe is an abandoned little creature.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHere Tink, who was in her bedroom, eavesdropping, squeaked out something\\r\\nimpudent.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe says she glories in being abandoned,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter interpreted.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe had a sudden idea. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps Tink wants to be my mother?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou silly ass!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Tinker Bell in a passion.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe had said it so often that Wendy needed no translation.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI almost agree with her,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy snapped. Fancy Wendy snapping! But\\r\\nshe had been much tried, and she little knew what was to happen before the\\r\\nnight was out. If she had known she would not have snapped.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNone of them knew. Perhaps it was best not to know. Their ignorance gave them\\r\\none more glad hour; and as it was to be their last hour on the island, let us\\r\\nrejoice that there were sixty glad minutes in it. They sang and danced in their\\r\\nnight-gowns. Such a deliciously creepy song it was, in which they pretended to\\r\\nbe frightened at their own shadows, little witting that so soon shadows would\\r\\nclose in upon them, from whom they would shrink in real fear. So uproariously\\r\\ngay was the dance, and how they buffeted each other on the bed and out of it!\\r\\nIt was a pillow fight rather than a dance, and when it was finished, the\\r\\npillows insisted on one bout more, like partners who know that they may never\\r\\nmeet again. The stories they told, before it was time for Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ngood-night story! Even Slightly tried to tell a story that night, but the\\r\\nbeginning was so fearfully dull that it appalled not only the others but\\r\\nhimself, and he said gloomily:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, it is a dull beginning. I say, let us pretend that it is the\\r\\nend.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd then at last they all got into bed for Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s story, the story they\\r\\nloved best, the story Peter hated. Usually when she began to tell this story he\\r\\nleft the room or put his hands over his ears; and possibly if he had done\\r\\neither of those things this time they might all still be on the island.

Can they be John and Michael? They are!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98See, dear brothers,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 says Wendy pointing upwards,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98there is the window still standing open. Ah, now we are rewarded for our\\r\\nsublime faith in a mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s love.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 So up they flew to their mummy\\r\\nand daddy, and pen cannot describe the happy scene, over which we draw a\\r\\nveil.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThat was the story, and they were as pleased with it as the fair narrator\\r\\nherself. Everything just as it should be, you see. Off we skip like the most\\r\\nheartless things in the world, which is what children are, but so attractive;\\r\\nand we have an entirely selfish time, and then when we have need of special\\r\\nattention we nobly return for it, confident that we shall be rewarded instead\\r\\nof smacked.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo great indeed was their faith in a mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s love that they felt they\\r\\ncould afford to be callous for a bit longer.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut there was one there who knew better, and when Wendy finished he uttered a\\r\\nhollow groan.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is it, Peter?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, running to him, thinking he was\\r\\nill. She felt him solicitously, lower down than his chest. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere is it,\\r\\nPeter?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that kind of pain,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter replied darkly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen what kind is it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWendy, you are wrong about mothers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey all gathered round him in affright, so alarming was his agitation; and\\r\\nwith a fine candour he told them what he had hitherto concealed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLong ago,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought like you that my mother would\\r\\nalways keep the window open for me, so I stayed away for moons and moons and\\r\\nmoons, and then flew back; but the window was barred, for mother had forgotten\\r\\nall about me, and there was another little boy sleeping in my bed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI am not sure that this was true, but Peter thought it was true; and it scared\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you sure mothers are like that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo this was the truth about mothers. The toads!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nStill it is best to be careful; and no one knows so quickly as a child when he\\r\\nshould give in. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWendy, let us go home,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried John and Michael\\r\\ntogether.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, clutching them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNot to-night?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked the lost boys bewildered. They knew in what\\r\\nthey called their hearts that one can get on quite well without a mother, and\\r\\nthat it is only the mothers who think you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAt once,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy replied resolutely, for the horrible thought had\\r\\ncome to her: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps mother is in half mourning by this time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThis dread made her forgetful of what must be Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s feelings, and she\\r\\nsaid to him rather sharply, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter, will you make the necessary\\r\\narrangements?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you wish it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied, as coolly as if she had asked him to\\r\\npass the nuts.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNot so much as a sorry-to-lose-you between them! If she did not mind the\\r\\nparting, he was going to show her, was Peter, that neither did he.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut of course he cared very much; and he was so full of wrath against\\r\\ngrown-ups, who, as usual, were spoiling everything, that as soon as he got\\r\\ninside his tree he breathed intentionally quick short breaths at the rate of\\r\\nabout five to a second. He did this because there is a saying in the Neverland\\r\\nthat, every time you breathe, a grown-up dies; and Peter was killing them off\\r\\nvindictively as fast as possible.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen having given the necessary instructions to the redskins he returned to the\\r\\nhome, where an unworthy scene had been enacted in his absence. Panic-stricken\\r\\nat the thought of losing Wendy the lost boys had advanced upon her\\r\\nthreateningly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt will be worse than before she came,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they cried.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe shan\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let her go.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s keep her prisoner.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAy, chain her up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn her extremity an instinct told her to which of them to turn.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTootles,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI appeal to you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWas it not strange? She appealed to Tootles, quite the silliest one.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nGrandly, however, did Tootles respond. For that one moment he dropped his\\r\\nsilliness and spoke with dignity.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am just Tootles,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand nobody minds me. But the\\r\\nfirst who does not behave to Wendy like an English gentleman I will blood him\\r\\nseverely.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe drew back his hanger; and for that instant his sun was at noon. The others\\r\\nheld back uneasily. Then Peter returned, and they saw at once that they would\\r\\nget no support from him. He would keep no girl in the Neverland against her\\r\\nwill.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWendy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, striding up and down, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have asked the\\r\\nredskins to guide you through the wood, as flying tires you so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThank you, Peter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he continued, in the short sharp voice of one accustomed to\\r\\nbe obeyed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTinker Bell will take you across the sea. Wake her,\\r\\nNibs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNibs had to knock twice before he got an answer, though Tink had really been\\r\\nsitting up in bed listening for some time.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho are you? How dare you? Go away,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou are to get up, Tink,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nibs called, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand take Wendy on a\\r\\njourney.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf course Tink had been delighted to hear that Wendy was going; but she was\\r\\njolly well determined not to be her courier, and she said so in still more\\r\\noffensive language. Then she pretended to be asleep again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe says she won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nibs exclaimed, aghast at such\\r\\ninsubordination, whereupon Peter went sternly toward the young lady\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nchamber.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTink,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he rapped out, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get up and dress\\r\\nat once I will open the curtains, and then we shall all see you in your\\r\\n<i>neglig\\xc3\\xa9e</i>.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThis made her leap to the floor. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho said I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t getting\\r\\nup?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the meantime the boys were gazing very forlornly at Wendy, now equipped with\\r\\nJohn and Michael for the journey. By this time they were dejected, not merely\\r\\nbecause they were about to lose her, but also because they felt that she was\\r\\ngoing off to something nice to which they had not been invited. Novelty was\\r\\nbeckoning to them as usual.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCrediting them with a nobler feeling Wendy melted.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDear ones,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif you will all come with me I feel\\r\\nalmost sure I can get my father and mother to adopt you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe invitation was meant specially for Peter, but each of the boys was thinking\\r\\nexclusively of himself, and at once they jumped with joy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they think us rather a handful?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nibs asked in the\\r\\nmiddle of his jump.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh no,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Wendy, rapidly thinking it out, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit will only\\r\\nmean having a few beds in the drawing-room; they can be hidden behind the\\r\\nscreens on first Thursdays.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter, can we go?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they all cried imploringly. They took it for\\r\\ngranted that if they went he would go also, but really they scarcely cared.\\r\\nThus children are ever ready, when novelty knocks, to desert their dearest\\r\\nones.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter replied with a bitter smile, and immediately\\r\\nthey rushed to get their things.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd now, Peter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy said, thinking she had put everything\\r\\nright, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am going to give you your medicine before you go.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d She\\r\\nloved to give them medicine, and undoubtedly gave them too much. Of course it\\r\\nwas only water, but it was out of a bottle, and she always shook the bottle and\\r\\ncounted the drops, which gave it a certain medicinal quality. On this occasion,\\r\\nhowever, she did not give Peter his draught, for just as she had prepared it,\\r\\nshe saw a look on his face that made her heart sink.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGet your things, Peter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, shaking.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he answered, pretending indifference, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am not going\\r\\nwith you, Wendy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, Peter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTo show that her departure would leave him unmoved, he skipped up and down the\\r\\nroom, playing gaily on his heartless pipes. She had to run about after him,\\r\\nthough it was rather undignified.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo find your mother,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she coaxed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, if Peter had ever quite had a mother, he no longer missed her. He could do\\r\\nvery well without one. He had thought them out, and remembered only their bad\\r\\npoints.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told Wendy decisively; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cperhaps she would say I\\r\\nwas old, and I just want always to be a little boy and to have fun.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd so the others had to be told.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t coming.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter not coming! They gazed blankly at him, their sticks over their backs, and\\r\\non each stick a bundle. Their first thought was that if Peter was not going he\\r\\nhad probably changed his mind about letting them go.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut he was far too proud for that. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you find your mothers,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nsaid darkly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI hope you will like them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe awful cynicism of this made an uncomfortable impression, and most of them\\r\\nbegan to look rather doubtful. After all, their faces said, were they not\\r\\nnoodles to want to go?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow then,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Peter, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno fuss, no blubbering; good-bye,\\r\\nWendy;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and he held out his hand cheerily, quite as if they must really\\r\\ngo now, for he had something important to do.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe had to take his hand, and there was no indication that he would prefer a\\r\\nthimble.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou will remember about changing your flannels, Peter?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said,\\r\\nlingering over him. She was always so particular about their flannels.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd you will take your medicine?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThat seemed to be everything, and an awkward pause followed. Peter, however,\\r\\nwas not the kind that breaks down before other people. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre you ready,\\r\\nTinker Bell?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he called out.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAy, ay.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen lead the way.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTink darted up the nearest tree; but no one followed her, for it was at this\\r\\nmoment that the pirates made their dreadful attack upon the redskins. Above,\\r\\nwhere all had been so still, the air was rent with shrieks and the clash of\\r\\nsteel. Below, there was dead silence. Mouths opened and remained open. Wendy\\r\\nfell on her knees, but her arms were extended toward Peter. All arms were\\r\\nextended to him, as if suddenly blown in his direction; they were beseeching\\r\\nhim mutely not to desert them. As for Peter, he seized his sword, the same he\\r\\nthought he had slain Barbecue with, and the lust of battle was in his eye.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"chap12\"></a>Chapter XII.<br>\\r\\nTHE CHILDREN ARE CARRIED OFF</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe pirate attack had been a complete surprise: a sure proof that the\\r\\nunscrupulous Hook had conducted it improperly, for to surprise redskins fairly\\r\\nis beyond the wit of the white man.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy all the unwritten laws of savage warfare it is always the redskin who\\r\\nattacks, and with the wiliness of his race he does it just before the dawn, at\\r\\nwhich time he knows the courage of the whites to be at its lowest ebb. The\\r\\nwhite men have in the meantime made a rude stockade on the summit of yonder\\r\\nundulating ground, at the foot of which a stream runs, for it is destruction to\\r\\nbe too far from water. There they await the onslaught, the inexperienced ones\\r\\nclutching their revolvers and treading on twigs, but the old hands sleeping\\r\\ntranquilly until just before the dawn. Through the long black night the savage\\r\\nscouts wriggle, snake-like, among the grass without stirring a blade. The\\r\\nbrushwood closes behind them, as silently as sand into which a mole has dived.\\r\\nNot a sound is to be heard, save when they give vent to a wonderful imitation\\r\\nof the lonely call of the coyote. The cry is answered by other braves; and some\\r\\nof them do it even better than the coyotes, who are not very good at it. So the\\r\\nchill hours wear on, and the long suspense is horribly trying to the paleface\\r\\nwho has to live through it for the first time; but to the trained hand those\\r\\nghastly calls and still ghastlier silences are but an intimation of how the\\r\\nnight is marching.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThat this was the usual procedure was so well known to Hook that in\\r\\ndisregarding it he cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Piccaninnies, on their part, trusted implicitly to his honour, and their\\r\\nwhole action of the night stands out in marked contrast to his. They left\\r\\nnothing undone that was consistent with the reputation of their tribe. With\\r\\nthat alertness of the senses which is at once the marvel and despair of\\r\\ncivilised peoples, they knew that the pirates were on the island from the\\r\\nmoment one of them trod on a dry stick; and in an incredibly short space of\\r\\ntime the coyote cries began. Every foot of ground between the spot where Hook\\r\\nhad landed his forces and the home under the trees was stealthily examined by\\r\\nbraves wearing their mocassins with the heels in front. They found only one\\r\\nhillock with a stream at its base, so that Hook had no choice; here he must\\r\\nestablish himself and wait for just before the dawn. Everything being thus\\r\\nmapped out with almost diabolical cunning, the main body of the redskins folded\\r\\ntheir blankets around them, and in the phlegmatic manner that is to them, the\\r\\npearl of manhood squatted above the children\\xe2\\x80\\x99s home, awaiting the cold\\r\\nmoment when they should deal pale death.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHere dreaming, though wide-awake, of the exquisite tortures to which they were\\r\\nto put him at break of day, those confiding savages were found by the\\r\\ntreacherous Hook. From the accounts afterwards supplied by such of the scouts\\r\\nas escaped the carnage, he does not seem even to have paused at the rising\\r\\nground, though it is certain that in that grey light he must have seen it: no\\r\\nthought of waiting to be attacked appears from first to last to have visited\\r\\nhis subtle mind; he would not even hold off till the night was nearly spent; on\\r\\nhe pounded with no policy but to fall to. What could the bewildered scouts do,\\r\\nmasters as they were of every war-like artifice save this one, but trot\\r\\nhelplessly after him, exposing themselves fatally to view, while they gave\\r\\npathetic utterance to the coyote cry.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAround the brave Tiger Lily were a dozen of her stoutest warriors, and they\\r\\nsuddenly saw the perfidious pirates bearing down upon them. Fell from their\\r\\neyes then the film through which they had looked at victory. No more would they\\r\\ntorture at the stake. For them the happy hunting-grounds was now. They knew it;\\r\\nbut as their father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sons they acquitted themselves. Even then they had\\r\\ntime to gather in a phalanx that would have been hard to break had they risen\\r\\nquickly, but this they were forbidden to do by the traditions of their race. It\\r\\nis written that the noble savage must never express surprise in the presence of\\r\\nthe white. Thus terrible as the sudden appearance of the pirates must have been\\r\\nto them, they remained stationary for a moment, not a muscle moving; as if the\\r\\nfoe had come by invitation. Then, indeed, the tradition gallantly upheld, they\\r\\nseized their weapons, and the air was torn with the war-cry; but it was now too\\r\\nlate.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt is no part of ours to describe what was a massacre rather than a fight. Thus\\r\\nperished many of the flower of the Piccaninny tribe. Not all unavenged did they\\r\\ndie, for with Lean Wolf fell Alf Mason, to disturb the Spanish Main no more,\\r\\nand among others who bit the dust were Geo. Scourie, Chas. Turley, and the\\r\\nAlsatian Foggerty. Turley fell to the tomahawk of the terrible Panther, who\\r\\nultimately cut a way through the pirates with Tiger Lily and a small remnant of\\r\\nthe tribe.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTo what extent Hook is to blame for his tactics on this occasion is for the\\r\\nhistorian to decide. Had he waited on the rising ground till the proper hour he\\r\\nand his men would probably have been butchered; and in judging him it is only\\r\\nfair to take this into account. What he should perhaps have done was to\\r\\nacquaint his opponents that he proposed to follow a new method. On the other\\r\\nhand, this, as destroying the element of surprise, would have made his strategy\\r\\nof no avail, so that the whole question is beset with difficulties. One cannot\\r\\nat least withhold a reluctant admiration for the wit that had conceived so bold\\r\\na scheme, and the fell genius with which it was carried out.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhat were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant moment? Fain would\\r\\nhis dogs have known, as breathing heavily and wiping their cutlasses, they\\r\\ngathered at a discreet distance from his hook, and squinted through their\\r\\nferret eyes at this extraordinary man. Elation must have been in his heart, but\\r\\nhis face did not reflect it: ever a dark and solitary enigma, he stood aloof\\r\\nfrom his followers in spirit as in substance.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe night\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work was not yet over, for it was not the redskins he had\\r\\ncome out to destroy; they were but the bees to be smoked, so that he should get\\r\\nat the honey. It was Pan he wanted, Pan and Wendy and their band, but chiefly\\r\\nPan.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hatred\\r\\nof him. True he had flung Hook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arm to the crocodile, but even this and\\r\\nthe increased insecurity of life to which it led, owing to the\\r\\ncrocodile\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pertinacity, hardly account for a vindictiveness so\\r\\nrelentless and malignant. The truth is that there was a something about Peter\\r\\nwhich goaded the pirate captain to frenzy. It was not his courage, it was not\\r\\nhis engaging appearance, it was not\\xe2\\x80\\x94. There is no beating about the bush,\\r\\nfor we know quite well what it was, and have got to tell. It was Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncockiness.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThis had got on Hook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nerves; it made his iron claw twitch, and at night\\r\\nit disturbed him like an insect. While Peter lived, the tortured man felt that\\r\\nhe was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe question now was how to get down the trees, or how to get his dogs down? He\\r\\nran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the thinnest ones. They wriggled\\r\\nuncomfortably, for they knew he would not scruple to ram them down with poles.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the meantime, what of the boys? We have seen them at the first clang of the\\r\\nweapons, turned as it were into stone figures, open-mouthed, all appealing with\\r\\noutstretched arms to Peter; and we return to them as their mouths close, and\\r\\ntheir arms fall to their sides. The pandemonium above has ceased almost as\\r\\nsuddenly as it arose, passed like a fierce gust of wind; but they know that in\\r\\nthe passing it has determined their fate.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhich side had won?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe pirates, listening avidly at the mouths of the trees, heard the question\\r\\nput by every boy, and alas, they also heard Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s answer.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf the redskins have won,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey will beat the\\r\\ntom-tom; it is always their sign of victory.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow Smee had found the tom-tom, and was at that moment sitting on it.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou will never hear the tom-tom again,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he muttered, but inaudibly\\r\\nof course, for strict silence had been enjoined. To his amazement Hook signed\\r\\nhim to beat the tom-tom, and slowly there came to Smee an understanding of the\\r\\ndreadful wickedness of the order. Never, probably, had this simple man admired\\r\\nHook so much.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTwice Smee beat upon the instrument, and then stopped to listen gleefully.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe tom-tom,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the miscreants heard Peter cry; \\xe2\\x80\\x9can Indian\\r\\nvictory!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black hearts\\r\\nabove, and almost immediately they repeated their good-byes to Peter. This\\r\\npuzzled the pirates, but all their other feelings were swallowed by a base\\r\\ndelight that the enemy were about to come up the trees. They smirked at each\\r\\nother and rubbed their hands. Rapidly and silently Hook gave his orders: one\\r\\nman to each tree, and the others to arrange themselves in a line two yards\\r\\napart.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"chap13\"></a>Chapter XIII.<br>\\r\\nDO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe more quickly this horror is disposed of the better. The first to emerge\\r\\nfrom his tree was Curly. He rose out of it into the arms of Cecco, who flung\\r\\nhim to Smee, who flung him to Starkey, who flung him to Bill Jukes, who flung\\r\\nhim to Noodler, and so he was tossed from one to another till he fell at the\\r\\nfeet of the black pirate. All the boys were plucked from their trees in this\\r\\nruthless manner; and several of them were in the air at a time, like bales of\\r\\ngoods flung from hand to hand.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA different treatment was accorded to Wendy, who came last. With ironical\\r\\npoliteness Hook raised his hat to her, and, offering her his arm, escorted her\\r\\nto the spot where the others were being gagged. He did it with such an air, he\\r\\nwas so frightfully <i>distingu\\xc3\\xa9</i>, that she was too fascinated to cry out.\\r\\nShe was only a little girl.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPerhaps it is tell-tale to divulge that for a moment Hook entranced her, and we\\r\\ntell on her only because her slip led to strange results. Had she haughtily\\r\\nunhanded him (and we should have loved to write it of her), she would have been\\r\\nhurled through the air like the others, and then Hook would probably not have\\r\\nbeen present at the tying of the children; and had he not been at the tying he\\r\\nwould not have discovered Slightly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s secret, and without the secret he\\r\\ncould not presently have made his foul attempt on Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey were tied to prevent their flying away, doubled up with their knees close\\r\\nto their ears; and for the trussing of them the black pirate had cut a rope\\r\\ninto nine equal pieces. All went well until Slightly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s turn came, when he\\r\\nwas found to be like those irritating parcels that use up all the string in\\r\\ngoing round and leave no tags with which to tie a knot. The pirates kicked him\\r\\nin their rage, just as you kick the parcel (though in fairness you should kick\\r\\nthe string); and strange to say it was Hook who told them to belay their\\r\\nviolence. His lip was curled with malicious triumph. While his dogs were merely\\r\\nsweating because every time they tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in one\\r\\npart he bulged out in another, Hook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s master mind had gone far beneath\\r\\nSlightly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surface, probing not for effects but for causes; and his\\r\\nexultation showed that he had found them. Slightly, white to the gills, knew\\r\\nthat Hook had surprised his secret, which was this, that no boy so blown out\\r\\ncould use a tree wherein an average man need stick. Poor Slightly, most\\r\\nwretched of all the children now, for he was in a panic about Peter, bitterly\\r\\nregretted what he had done. Madly addicted to the drinking of water when he was\\r\\nhot, he had swelled in consequence to his present girth, and instead of\\r\\nreducing himself to fit his tree he had, unknown to the others, whittled his\\r\\ntree to make it fit him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSufficient of this Hook guessed to persuade him that Peter at last lay at his\\r\\nmercy, but no word of the dark design that now formed in the subterranean\\r\\ncaverns of his mind crossed his lips; he merely signed that the captives were\\r\\nto be conveyed to the ship, and that he would be alone.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHow to convey them? Hunched up in their ropes they might indeed be rolled down\\r\\nhill like barrels, but most of the way lay through a morass. Again Hook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ngenius surmounted difficulties. He indicated that the little house must be used\\r\\nas a conveyance. The children were flung into it, four stout pirates raised it\\r\\non their shoulders, the others fell in behind, and singing the hateful pirate\\r\\nchorus the strange procession set off through the wood. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know\\r\\nwhether any of the children were crying; if so, the singing drowned the sound;\\r\\nbut as the little house disappeared in the forest, a brave though tiny jet of\\r\\nsmoke issued from its chimney as if defying Hook.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHook saw it, and it did Peter a bad service. It dried up any trickle of pity\\r\\nfor him that may have remained in the pirate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s infuriated breast.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe first thing he did on finding himself alone in the fast falling night was\\r\\nto tiptoe to Slightly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tree, and make sure that it provided him with a\\r\\npassage. Then for long he remained brooding; his hat of ill omen on the sward,\\r\\nso that any gentle breeze which had arisen might play refreshingly through his\\r\\nhair. Dark as were his thoughts his blue eyes were as soft as the periwinkle.\\r\\nIntently he listened for any sound from the nether world, but all was as silent\\r\\nbelow as above; the house under the ground seemed to be but one more empty\\r\\ntenement in the void. Was that boy asleep, or did he stand waiting at the foot\\r\\nof Slightly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tree, with his dagger in his hand?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere was no way of knowing, save by going down. Hook let his cloak slip softly\\r\\nto the ground, and then biting his lips till a lewd blood stood on them, he\\r\\nstepped into the tree. He was a brave man, but for a moment he had to stop\\r\\nthere and wipe his brow, which was dripping like a candle. Then, silently, he\\r\\nlet himself go into the unknown.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft, and stood still again, biting\\r\\nat his breath, which had almost left him. As his eyes became accustomed to the\\r\\ndim light various objects in the home under the trees took shape; but the only\\r\\none on which his greedy gaze rested, long sought for and found at last, was the\\r\\ngreat bed. On the bed lay Peter fast asleep.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nUnaware of the tragedy being enacted above, Peter had continued, for a little\\r\\ntime after the children left, to play gaily on his pipes: no doubt rather a\\r\\nforlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not care. Then he decided not\\r\\nto take his medicine, so as to grieve Wendy. Then he lay down on the bed\\r\\noutside the coverlet, to vex her still more; for she had always tucked them\\r\\ninside it, because you never know that you may not grow chilly at the turn of\\r\\nthe night. Then he nearly cried; but it struck him how indignant she would be\\r\\nif he laughed instead; so he laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the\\r\\nmiddle of it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSometimes, though not often, he had dreams, and they were more painful than the\\r\\ndreams of other boys. For hours he could not be separated from these dreams,\\r\\nthough he wailed piteously in them. They had to do, I think, with the riddle of\\r\\nhis existence. At such times it had been Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s custom to take him out\\r\\nof bed and sit with him on her lap, soothing him in dear ways of her own\\r\\ninvention, and when he grew calmer to put him back to bed before he quite woke\\r\\nup, so that he should not know of the indignity to which she had subjected him.\\r\\nBut on this occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep. One arm\\r\\ndropped over the edge of the bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished part\\r\\nof his laugh was stranded on his mouth, which was open, showing the little\\r\\npearls.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThus defenceless Hook found him. He stood silent at the foot of the tree\\r\\nlooking across the chamber at his enemy. Did no feeling of compassion disturb\\r\\nhis sombre breast? The man was not wholly evil; he loved flowers (I have been\\r\\ntold) and sweet music (he was himself no mean performer on the harpsichord);\\r\\nand, let it be frankly admitted, the idyllic nature of the scene stirred him\\r\\nprofoundly. Mastered by his better self he would have returned reluctantly up\\r\\nthe tree, but for one thing.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhat stayed him was Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impertinent appearance as he slept. The open\\r\\nmouth, the drooping arm, the arched knee: they were such a personification of\\r\\ncockiness as, taken together, will never again, one may hope, be presented to\\r\\neyes so sensitive to their offensiveness. They steeled Hook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart. If\\r\\nhis rage had broken him into a hundred pieces every one of them would have\\r\\ndisregarded the incident, and leapt at the sleeper.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThough a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed, Hook stood in darkness\\r\\nhimself, and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered an obstacle, the\\r\\ndoor of Slightly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tree. It did not entirely fill the aperture, and he\\r\\nhad been looking over it. Feeling for the catch, he found to his fury that it\\r\\nwas low down, beyond his reach. To his disordered brain it seemed then that the\\r\\nirritating quality in Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face and figure visibly increased, and he\\r\\nrattled the door and flung himself against it. Was his enemy to escape him\\r\\nafter all?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut what was that? The red in his eye had caught sight of Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmedicine standing on a ledge within easy reach. He fathomed what it was\\r\\nstraightaway, and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLest he should be taken alive, Hook always carried about his person a dreadful\\r\\ndrug, blended by himself of all the death-dealing rings that had come into his\\r\\npossession. These he had boiled down into a yellow liquid quite unknown to\\r\\nscience, which was probably the most virulent poison in existence.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFive drops of this he now added to Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cup. His hand shook, but it\\r\\nwas in exultation rather than in shame. As he did it he avoided glancing at the\\r\\nsleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve him; merely to avoid spilling. Then\\r\\none long gloating look he cast upon his victim, and turning, wormed his way\\r\\nwith difficulty up the tree. As he emerged at the top he looked the very spirit\\r\\nof evil breaking from its hole. Donning his hat at its most rakish angle, he\\r\\nwound his cloak around him, holding one end in front as if to conceal his\\r\\nperson from the night, of which it was the blackest part, and muttering\\r\\nstrangely to himself, stole away through the trees.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter slept on. The light guttered and went out, leaving the tenement in\\r\\ndarkness; but still he slept. It must have been not less than ten o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock\\r\\nby the crocodile, when he suddenly sat up in his bed, wakened by he knew not\\r\\nwhat. It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his tree.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSoft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister. Peter felt for his\\r\\ndagger till his hand gripped it. Then he spoke.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho is that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor long there was no answer: then again the knock.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho are you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNo answer.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe was thrilled, and he loved being thrilled. In two strides he reached the\\r\\ndoor. Unlike Slightly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s door, it filled the aperture, so that he could\\r\\nnot see beyond it, nor could the one knocking see him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t open unless you speak,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter cried.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like voice.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet me in, Peter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was Tink, and quickly he unbarred to her. She flew in excitedly, her face\\r\\nflushed and her dress stained with mud.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, you could never guess!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried, and offered him three\\r\\nguesses. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOut with it!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he shouted, and in one ungrammatical\\r\\nsentence, as long as the ribbons that conjurers pull from their mouths, she\\r\\ntold of the capture of Wendy and the boys.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart bobbed up and down as he listened. Wendy bound, and on the\\r\\npirate ship; she who loved everything to be just so!\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll rescue her!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried, leaping at his weapons. As he\\r\\nleapt he thought of something he could do to please her. He could take his\\r\\nmedicine.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHis hand closed on the fatal draught.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shrieked Tinker Bell, who had heard Hook mutter about his\\r\\ndeed as he sped through the forest.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy not?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is poisoned.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoisoned? Who could have poisoned it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHook.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be silly. How could Hook have got down here?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAlas, Tinker Bell could not explain this, for even she did not know the dark\\r\\nsecret of Slightly\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tree. Nevertheless Hook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words had left no\\r\\nroom for doubt. The cup was poisoned.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBesides,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Peter, quite believing himself, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI never fell\\r\\nasleep.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe raised the cup. No time for words now; time for deeds; and with one of her\\r\\nlightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught, and drained it\\r\\nto the dregs.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy, Tink, how dare you drink my medicine?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut she did not answer. Already she was reeling in the air.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is the matter with you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Peter, suddenly afraid.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was poisoned, Peter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she told him softly; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand now I am\\r\\ngoing to be dead.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cO Tink, did you drink it to save me?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut why, Tink?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHer wings would scarcely carry her now, but in reply she alighted on his\\r\\nshoulder and gave his nose a loving bite. She whispered in his ear \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou\\r\\nsilly ass,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and then, tottering to her chamber, lay down on the bed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHis head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt near her\\r\\nin distress. Every moment her light was growing fainter; and he knew that if it\\r\\nwent out she would be no more. She liked his tears so much that she put out her\\r\\nbeautiful finger and let them run over it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHer voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said. Then he\\r\\nmade it out. She was saying that she thought she could get well again if\\r\\nchildren believed in fairies.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter flung out his arms. There were no children there, and it was night time;\\r\\nbut he addressed all who might be dreaming of the Neverland, and who were\\r\\ntherefore nearer to him than you think: boys and girls in their nighties, and\\r\\nnaked papooses in their baskets hung from trees.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you believe?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe fancied she heard answers in the affirmative, and then again she\\r\\nwasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sure.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you think?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked Peter.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf you believe,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he shouted to them, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclap your hands;\\r\\ndon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let Tink die.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMany clapped.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSome didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA few beasts hissed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe clapping stopped suddenly; as if countless mothers had rushed to their\\r\\nnurseries to see what on earth was happening; but already Tink was saved. First\\r\\nher voice grew strong, then she popped out of bed, then she was flashing\\r\\nthrough the room more merry and impudent than ever. She never thought of\\r\\nthanking those who believed, but she would have liked to get at the ones who\\r\\nhad hissed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd now to rescue Wendy!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his tree, begirt\\r\\nwith weapons and wearing little else, to set out upon his perilous quest. It\\r\\nwas not such a night as he would have chosen. He had hoped to fly, keeping not\\r\\nfar from the ground so that nothing unwonted should escape his eyes; but in\\r\\nthat fitful light to have flown low would have meant trailing his shadow\\r\\nthrough the trees, thus disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he\\r\\nwas astir.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange names\\r\\nthat they are very wild and difficult of approach.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion, at which\\r\\nhappily he was an adept. But in what direction, for he could not be sure that\\r\\nthe children had been taken to the ship? A light fall of snow had obliterated\\r\\nall footmarks; and a deathly silence pervaded the island, as if for a space\\r\\nNature stood still in horror of the recent carnage. He had taught the children\\r\\nsomething of the forest lore that he had himself learned from Tiger Lily and\\r\\nTinker Bell, and knew that in their dire hour they were not likely to forget\\r\\nit. Slightly, if he had an opportunity, would blaze the trees, for instance,\\r\\nCurly would drop seeds, and Wendy would leave her handkerchief at some\\r\\nimportant place. The morning was needed to search for such guidance, and he\\r\\ncould not wait. The upper world had called him, but would give no help.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe crocodile passed him, but not another living thing, not a sound, not a\\r\\nmovement; and yet he knew well that sudden death might be at the next tree, or\\r\\nstalking him from behind.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe swore this terrible oath: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHook or me this time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow he crawled forward like a snake, and again erect, he darted across a space\\r\\non which the moonlight played, one finger on his lip and his dagger at the\\r\\nready. He was frightfully happy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"chap14\"></a>Chapter XIV.<br>\\r\\nTHE PIRATE SHIP</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOne green light squinting over Kidd\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Creek, which is near the mouth of\\r\\nthe pirate river, marked where the brig, the <i>Jolly Roger</i>, lay, low in\\r\\nthe water; a rakish-looking craft foul to the hull, every beam in her\\r\\ndetestable, like ground strewn with mangled feathers. She was the cannibal of\\r\\nthe seas, and scarce needed that watchful eye, for she floated immune in the\\r\\nhorror of her name.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe was wrapped in the blanket of night, through which no sound from her could\\r\\nhave reached the shore. There was little sound, and none agreeable save the\\r\\nwhir of the ship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sewing machine at which Smee sat, ever industrious and\\r\\nobliging, the essence of the commonplace, pathetic Smee. I know not why he was\\r\\nso infinitely pathetic, unless it were because he was so pathetically unaware\\r\\nof it; but even strong men had to turn hastily from looking at him, and more\\r\\nthan once on summer evenings he had touched the fount of Hook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tears and\\r\\nmade it flow. Of this, as of almost everything else, Smee was quite\\r\\nunconscious.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks, drinking in the miasma of the\\r\\nnight; others sprawled by barrels over games of dice and cards; and the\\r\\nexhausted four who had carried the little house lay prone on the deck, where\\r\\neven in their sleep they rolled skillfully to this side or that out of\\r\\nHook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reach, lest he should claw them mechanically in passing.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHook trod the deck in thought. O man unfathomable. It was his hour of triumph.\\r\\nPeter had been removed for ever from his path, and all the other boys were in\\r\\nthe brig, about to walk the plank. It was his grimmest deed since the days when\\r\\nhe had brought Barbecue to heel; and knowing as we do how vain a tabernacle is\\r\\nman, could we be surprised had he now paced the deck unsteadily, bellied out by\\r\\nthe winds of his success?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut there was no elation in his gait, which kept pace with the action of his\\r\\nsombre mind. Hook was profoundly dejected.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in the quietude of\\r\\nthe night. It was because he was so terribly alone. This inscrutable man never\\r\\nfelt more alone than when surrounded by his dogs. They were socially inferior\\r\\nto him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHook was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would even at this date\\r\\nset the country in a blaze; but as those who read between the lines must\\r\\nalready have guessed, he had been at a famous public school; and its traditions\\r\\nstill clung to him like garments, with which indeed they are largely concerned.\\r\\nThus it was offensive to him even now to board a ship in the same dress in\\r\\nwhich he grappled her, and he still adhered in his walk to the school\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndistinguished slouch. But above all he retained the passion for good form.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nGood form! However much he may have degenerated, he still knew that this is all\\r\\nthat really matters.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFrom far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals, and through them\\r\\ncame a stern tap-tap-tap, like hammering in the night when one cannot sleep.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you been good form to-day?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was their eternal question.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFame, fame, that glittering bauble, it is mine,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs it quite good form to be distinguished at anything?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the\\r\\ntap-tap from his school replied.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am the only man whom Barbecue feared,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he urged, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand\\r\\nFlint feared Barbecue.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBarbecue, Flint\\xe2\\x80\\x94what house?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d came the cutting retort.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMost disquieting reflection of all, was it not bad form to think about good\\r\\nform?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHis vitals were tortured by this problem. It was a claw within him sharper than\\r\\nthe iron one; and as it tore him, the perspiration dripped down his tallow\\r\\ncountenance and streaked his doublet. Ofttimes he drew his sleeve across his\\r\\nface, but there was no damming that trickle.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAh, envy not Hook.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution. It was as if\\r\\nPeter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terrible oath had boarded the ship. Hook felt a gloomy desire to\\r\\nmake his dying speech, lest presently there should be no time for it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBetter for Hook,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif he had had less\\r\\nambition!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It was in his darkest hours only that he referred to himself\\r\\nin the third person.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo little children to love me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nStrange that he should think of this, which had never troubled him before;\\r\\nperhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind. For long he muttered to\\r\\nhimself, staring at Smee, who was hemming placidly, under the conviction that\\r\\nall children feared him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFeared him! Feared Smee! There was not a child on board the brig that night who\\r\\ndid not already love him. He had said horrid things to them and hit them with\\r\\nthe palm of his hand, because he could not hit with his fist, but they had only\\r\\nclung to him the more. Michael had tried on his spectacles.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTo tell poor Smee that they thought him lovable! Hook itched to do it, but it\\r\\nseemed too brutal. Instead, he revolved this mystery in his mind: why do they\\r\\nfind Smee lovable? He pursued the problem like the sleuth-hound that he was. If\\r\\nSmee was lovable, what was it that made him so? A terrible answer suddenly\\r\\npresented itself\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood form?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHad the bo\\xe2\\x80\\x99sun good form without knowing it, which is the best form of\\r\\nall?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe remembered that you have to prove you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know you have it before\\r\\nyou are eligible for Pop.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWith a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over Smee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head; but he did\\r\\nnot tear. What arrested him was this reflection:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo claw a man because he is good form, what would that be?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBad form!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe unhappy Hook was as impotent as he was damp, and he fell forward like a cut\\r\\nflower.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHis dogs thinking him out of the way for a time, discipline instantly relaxed;\\r\\nand they broke into a bacchanalian dance, which brought him to his feet at\\r\\nonce, all traces of human weakness gone, as if a bucket of water had passed\\r\\nover him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuiet, you scugs,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cor I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll cast anchor in\\r\\nyou;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and at once the din was hushed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre all the children\\r\\nchained, so that they cannot fly away?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAy, ay.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen hoist them up.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold, all except Wendy, and ranged\\r\\nin line in front of him. For a time he seemed unconscious of their presence. He\\r\\nlolled at his ease, humming, not unmelodiously, snatches of a rude song, and\\r\\nfingering a pack of cards. Ever and anon the light from his cigar gave a touch\\r\\nof colour to his face.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow then, bullies,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said briskly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csix of you walk the\\r\\nplank to-night, but I have room for two cabin boys. Which of you is it to\\r\\nbe?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t irritate him unnecessarily,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d had been Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ninstructions in the hold; so Tootles stepped forward politely. Tootles hated\\r\\nthe idea of signing under such a man, but an instinct told him that it would be\\r\\nprudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person; and though a somewhat\\r\\nsilly boy, he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be the buffer. All\\r\\nchildren know this about mothers, and despise them for it, but make constant\\r\\nuse of it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSo Tootles explained prudently, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou see, sir, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think my\\r\\nmother would like me to be a pirate. Would your mother like you to be a pirate,\\r\\nSlightly?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe winked at Slightly, who said mournfully, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think\\r\\nso,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as if he wished things had been otherwise. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWould your mother\\r\\nlike you to be a pirate, Twin?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think so,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said the first twin, as clever as the\\r\\nothers. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNibs, would\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStow this gab,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d roared Hook, and the spokesmen were dragged back.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou, boy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, addressing John, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou look as if you had\\r\\na little pluck in you. Didst never want to be a pirate, my hearty?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths. prep.; and he was\\r\\nstruck by Hook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s picking him out.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said\\r\\ndiffidently.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd a good name too. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll call you that here, bully, if you\\r\\njoin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you think, Michael?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked John.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat would you call me if I join?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Michael demanded.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlackbeard Joe.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMichael was naturally impressed. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do you think, John?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He\\r\\nwanted John to decide, and John wanted him to decide.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShall we still be respectful subjects of the King?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d John inquired.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThrough Hook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s teeth came the answer: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou would have to swear,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98Down with the King.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPerhaps John had not behaved very well so far, but he shone out now.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen I refuse,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried, banging the barrel in front of Hook.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd I refuse,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Michael.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRule Britannia!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d squeaked Curly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth; and Hook roared out,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat seals your doom. Bring up their mother. Get the plank ready.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey were only boys, and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco preparing\\r\\nthe fatal plank. But they tried to look brave when Wendy was brought up.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNo words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates. To the boys\\r\\nthere was at least some glamour in the pirate calling; but all that she saw was\\r\\nthat the ship had not been tidied for years. There was not a porthole on the\\r\\ngrimy glass of which you might not have written with your finger \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDirty\\r\\npig\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; and she had already written it on several. But as the boys gathered\\r\\nround her she had no thought, of course, save for them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo, my beauty,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Hook, as if he spoke in syrup, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou are\\r\\nto see your children walk the plank.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFine gentlemen though he was, the intensity of his communings had soiled his\\r\\nruff, and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it. With a hasty gesture he\\r\\ntried to hide it, but he was too late.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAre they to die?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Wendy, with a look of such frightful\\r\\ncontempt that he nearly fainted.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey are,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he snarled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSilence all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he called\\r\\ngloatingly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor a mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s last words to her children.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt this moment Wendy was grand. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese are my last words, dear\\r\\nboys,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said firmly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI feel that I have a message to you from\\r\\nyour real mothers, and it is this: \\xe2\\x80\\x98We hope our sons will die like\\r\\nEnglish gentlemen.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEven the pirates were awed, and Tootles cried out hysterically, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am\\r\\ngoing to do what my mother hopes. What are you to do, Nibs?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat my mother hopes. What are you to do, Twin?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat my mother hopes. John, what are\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut Hook had found his voice again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTie her up!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he shouted.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was Smee who tied her to the mast. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSee here, honey,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\nwhispered, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll save you if you promise to be my mother.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut not even for Smee would she make such a promise. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI would almost\\r\\nrather have no children at all,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said disdainfully.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as Smee tied her to the\\r\\nmast; the eyes of all were on the plank: that last little walk they were about\\r\\nto take. They were no longer able to hope that they would walk it manfully, for\\r\\nthe capacity to think had gone from them; they could stare and shiver only.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHook smiled on them with his teeth closed, and took a step toward Wendy. His\\r\\nintention was to turn her face so that she should see the boys walking the\\r\\nplank one by one. But he never reached her, he never heard the cry of anguish\\r\\nhe hoped to wring from her. He heard something else instead.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey all heard it\\xe2\\x80\\x94pirates, boys, Wendy; and immediately every head was\\r\\nblown in one direction; not to the water whence the sound proceeded, but toward\\r\\nHook. All knew that what was about to happen concerned him alone, and that from\\r\\nbeing actors they were suddenly become spectators.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nVery frightful was it to see the change that came over him. It was as if he had\\r\\nbeen clipped at every joint. He fell in a little heap.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe sound came steadily nearer; and in advance of it came this ghastly thought,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe crocodile is about to board the ship!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEven the iron claw hung inactive; as if knowing that it was no intrinsic part\\r\\nof what the attacking force wanted. Left so fearfully alone, any other man\\r\\nwould have lain with his eyes shut where he fell: but the gigantic brain of\\r\\nHook was still working, and under its guidance he crawled on the knees along\\r\\nthe deck as far from the sound as he could go. The pirates respectfully cleared\\r\\na passage for him, and it was only when he brought up against the bulwarks that\\r\\nhe spoke.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHide me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried hoarsely.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey gathered round him, all eyes averted from the thing that was coming\\r\\naboard. They had no thought of fighting it. It was Fate.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOnly when Hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of the boys\\r\\nso that they could rush to the ship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side to see the crocodile climbing\\r\\nit. Then they got the strangest surprise of the Night of Nights; for it was no\\r\\ncrocodile that was coming to their aid. It was Peter.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might rouse\\r\\nsuspicion. Then he went on ticking.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"chap15\"></a>Chapter XV.<br>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHOOK OR ME THIS TIME\\xe2\\x80\\x9d</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOdd things happen to all of us on our way through life without our noticing for\\r\\na time that they have happened. Thus, to take an instance, we suddenly discover\\r\\nthat we have been deaf in one ear for we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how long, but, say,\\r\\nhalf an hour. Now such an experience had come that night to Peter. When last we\\r\\nsaw him he was stealing across the island with one finger to his lips and his\\r\\ndagger at the ready. He had seen the crocodile pass by without noticing\\r\\nanything peculiar about it, but by and by he remembered that it had not been\\r\\nticking. At first he thought this eerie, but soon concluded rightly that the\\r\\nclock had run down.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWithout giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a fellow-creature\\r\\nthus abruptly deprived of its closest companion, Peter began to consider how he\\r\\ncould turn the catastrophe to his own use; and he decided to tick, so that wild\\r\\nbeasts should believe he was the crocodile and let him pass unmolested. He\\r\\nticked superbly, but with one unforeseen result. The crocodile was among those\\r\\nwho heard the sound, and it followed him, though whether with the purpose of\\r\\nregaining what it had lost, or merely as a friend under the belief that it was\\r\\nagain ticking itself, will never be certainly known, for, like slaves to a\\r\\nfixed idea, it was a stupid beast.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter reached the shore without mishap, and went straight on, his legs\\r\\nencountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new element.\\r\\nThus many animals pass from land to water, but no other human of whom I know.\\r\\nAs he swam he had but one thought: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHook or me this time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He had\\r\\nticked so long that he now went on ticking without knowing that he was doing\\r\\nit. Had he known he would have stopped, for to board the brig by help of the\\r\\ntick, though an ingenious idea, had not occurred to him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOn the contrary, he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a mouse; and\\r\\nhe was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him, with Hook in their midst as\\r\\nabject as if he had heard the crocodile.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe crocodile! No sooner did Peter remember it than he heard the ticking. At\\r\\nfirst he thought the sound did come from the crocodile, and he looked behind\\r\\nhim swiftly. Then he realised that he was doing it himself, and in a flash he\\r\\nunderstood the situation. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow clever of me!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thought at once,\\r\\nand signed to the boys not to burst into applause.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was at this moment that Ed Teynte the quartermaster emerged from the\\r\\nforecastle and came along the deck. Now, reader, time what happened by your\\r\\nwatch. Peter struck true and deep. John clapped his hands on the ill-fated\\r\\npirate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mouth to stifle the dying groan. He fell forward. Four boys\\r\\ncaught him to prevent the thud. Peter gave the signal, and the carrion was cast\\r\\noverboard. There was a splash, and then silence. How long has it taken?\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Slightly had begun to count.)\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNone too soon, Peter, every inch of him on tiptoe, vanished into the cabin; for\\r\\nmore than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look round. They could hear\\r\\neach other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s distressed breathing now, which showed them that the more\\r\\nterrible sound had passed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gone, captain,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Smee said, wiping off his spectacles.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAll\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSlowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff, and listened so intently that he\\r\\ncould have caught the echo of the tick. There was not a sound, and he drew\\r\\nhimself up firmly to his full height.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to Johnny Plank!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried brazenly, hating the\\r\\nboys more than ever because they had seen him unbend. He broke into the\\r\\nvillainous ditty:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"poem\">\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYo ho, yo ho, the frisky plank,<br>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0You walks along it so,<br>\\r\\nTill it goes down and you goes down<br>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0To Davy Jones below!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTo terrorise the prisoners the more, though with a certain loss of dignity, he\\r\\ndanced along an imaginary plank, grimacing at them as he sang; and when he\\r\\nfinished he cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you want a touch of the cat before you walk the\\r\\nplank?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt that they fell on their knees. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they cried so piteously\\r\\nthat every pirate smiled.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFetch the cat, Jukes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Hook; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in the\\r\\ncabin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe cabin! Peter was in the cabin! The children gazed at each other.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAy, ay,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jukes blithely, and he strode into the cabin. They\\r\\nfollowed him with their eyes; they scarce knew that Hook had resumed his song,\\r\\nhis dogs joining in with him:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"poem\">\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYo ho, yo ho, the scratching cat,<br>\\r\\n\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0Its tails are nine, you know,<br>\\r\\nAnd when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re writ upon your back\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhat was the last line will never be known, for of a sudden the song was stayed\\r\\nby a dreadful screech from the cabin. It wailed through the ship, and died\\r\\naway. Then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood by the boys, but\\r\\nto the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat was that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Hook.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTwo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Slightly solemnly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Italian Cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin.

There was no more singing,\\r\\nall listened now; and again came a death-screech and again a crow.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNo one spoke except Slightly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThree,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHook rallied his dogs with a gesture. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x99S\\xe2\\x80\\x99death and odds\\r\\nfish,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he thundered, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwho is to bring me that doodle-doo?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWait till Cecco comes out,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d growled Starkey, and the others took\\r\\nup the cry.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think I heard you volunteer, Starkey,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Hook, purring again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, by thunder!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Starkey cried.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy hook thinks you did,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Hook, crossing to him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\r\\nwonder if it would not be advisable, Starkey, to humour the hook?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll swing before I go in there,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied Starkey doggedly,\\r\\nand again he had the support of the crew.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs this mutiny?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Hook more pleasantly than ever.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cStarkey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ringleader!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCaptain, mercy!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Starkey whimpered, all of a tremble now.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShake hands, Starkey,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Hook, proffering his claw.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nStarkey looked round for help, but all deserted him. As he backed up Hook\\r\\nadvanced, and now the red spark was in his eye. With a despairing scream the\\r\\npirate leapt upon Long Tom and precipitated himself into the sea.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFour,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Slightly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hook said courteously, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdid any other gentlemen\\r\\nsay mutiny?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Seizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacing\\r\\ngesture, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll bring out that doodle-doo myself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said,\\r\\nand sped into the cabin.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFive.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d How Slightly longed to say it. He wetted his lips to be\\r\\nready, but Hook came staggering out, without his lantern.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomething blew out the light,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said a little unsteadily.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSomething!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d echoed Mullins.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat of Cecco?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d demanded Noodler.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as dead as Jukes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Hook shortly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHis reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably, and the\\r\\nmutinous sounds again broke forth. All pirates are superstitious, and Cookson\\r\\ncried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey do say the surest sign a ship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accurst is when\\r\\nthere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one on board more than can be accounted for.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d muttered Mullins, \\xe2\\x80\\x9che always boards the\\r\\npirate craft last. Had he a tail, captain?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey say,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said another, looking viciously at Hook, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat\\r\\nwhen he comes it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHad he a hook, captain?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Cookson insolently; and one after\\r\\nanother took up the cry, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe ship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doomed!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d At this the\\r\\nchildren could not resist raising a cheer. Hook had well-nigh forgotten his\\r\\nprisoners, but as he swung round on them now his face lit up again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLads,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried to his crew, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnow here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a notion.\\r\\nOpen the cabin door and drive them in. Let them fight the doodle-doo for their\\r\\nlives. If they kill him, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so much the better; if he kills them,\\r\\nwe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re none the worse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor the last time his dogs admired Hook, and devotedly they did his bidding.\\r\\nThe boys, pretending to struggle, were pushed into the cabin and the door was\\r\\nclosed on them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow, listen!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Hook, and all listened. But not one dared to\\r\\nface the door. Yes, one, Wendy, who all this time had been bound to the mast.\\r\\nIt was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watching, it was for the\\r\\nreappearance of Peter.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe had not long to wait. In the cabin he had found the thing for which he had\\r\\ngone in search: the key that would free the children of their manacles, and now\\r\\nthey all stole forth, armed with such weapons as they could find. First signing\\r\\nthem to hide, Peter cut Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bonds, and then nothing could have been\\r\\neasier than for them all to fly off together; but one thing barred the way, an\\r\\noath, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHook or me this time.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d So when he had freed Wendy, he\\r\\nwhispered for her to conceal herself with the others, and himself took her\\r\\nplace by the mast, her cloak around him so that he should pass for her. Then he\\r\\ntook a great breath and crowed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTo the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the cabin;\\r\\nand they were panic-stricken. Hook tried to hearten them; but like the dogs he\\r\\nhad made them they showed him their fangs, and he knew that if he took his eyes\\r\\noff them now they would leap at him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLads,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, ready to cajole or strike as need be, but never\\r\\nquailing for an instant, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve thought it out. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a\\r\\nJonah aboard.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they snarled, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca man wi\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a hook.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, lads, no, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the girl. Never was luck on a pirate ship\\r\\nwi\\xe2\\x80\\x99 a woman on board. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll right the ship when she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ngone.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSome of them remembered that this had been a saying of Flint\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth trying,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they said doubtfully.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFling the girl overboard,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Hook; and they made a rush at the\\r\\nfigure in the cloak.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s none can save you now, missy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mullins hissed\\r\\njeeringly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d replied the figure.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho\\xe2\\x80\\x99s that?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter Pan the avenger!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d came the terrible answer; and as he spoke\\r\\nPeter flung off his cloak. Then they all knew who \\xe2\\x80\\x99twas that had been\\r\\nundoing them in the cabin, and twice Hook essayed to speak and twice he failed.\\r\\nIn that frightful moment I think his fierce heart broke.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt last he cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCleave him to the brisket!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but without\\r\\nconviction.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDown, boys, and at them!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voice rang out; and in\\r\\nanother moment the clash of arms was resounding through the ship. Had the\\r\\npirates kept together it is certain that they would have won; but the onset\\r\\ncame when they were still unstrung, and they ran hither and thither, striking\\r\\nwildly, each thinking himself the last survivor of the crew. Man to man they\\r\\nwere the stronger; but they fought on the defensive only, which enabled the\\r\\nboys to hunt in pairs and choose their quarry. Some of the miscreants leapt\\r\\ninto the sea; others hid in dark recesses, where they were found by Slightly,\\r\\nwho did not fight, but ran about with a lantern which he flashed in their\\r\\nfaces, so that they were half blinded and fell as an easy prey to the reeking\\r\\nswords of the other boys. There was little sound to be heard but the clang of\\r\\nweapons, an occasional screech or splash, and Slightly monotonously\\r\\ncounting\\xe2\\x80\\x94five\\xe2\\x80\\x94six\\xe2\\x80\\x94seven\\xe2\\x80\\x94eight\\xe2\\x80\\x94nine\\xe2\\x80\\x94ten\\xe2\\x80\\x94eleven.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded Hook, who seemed\\r\\nto have a charmed life, as he kept them at bay in that circle of fire. They had\\r\\ndone for his dogs, but this man alone seemed to be a match for them all. Again\\r\\nand again they closed upon him, and again and again he hewed a clear space. He\\r\\nhad lifted up one boy with his hook, and was using him as a buckler, when\\r\\nanother, who had just passed his sword through Mullins, sprang into the fray.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPut up your swords, boys,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried the newcomer, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis man is\\r\\nmine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThus suddenly Hook found himself face to face with Peter. The others drew back\\r\\nand formed a ring around them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor long the two enemies looked at one another, Hook shuddering slightly, and\\r\\nPeter with the strange smile upon his face.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo, Pan,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Hook at last, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis is all your doing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAy, James Hook,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d came the stern answer, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is all my\\r\\ndoing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cProud and insolent youth,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Hook, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprepare to meet thy\\r\\ndoom.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDark and sinister man,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter answered, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chave at\\r\\nthee.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWithout more words they fell to, and for a space there was no advantage to\\r\\neither blade. Peter was a superb swordsman, and parried with dazzling rapidity;\\r\\never and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge that got past his foe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ndefence, but his shorter reach stood him in ill stead, and he could not drive\\r\\nthe steel home. Hook, scarcely his inferior in brilliancy, but not quite so\\r\\nnimble in wrist play, forced him back by the weight of his onset, hoping\\r\\nsuddenly to end all with a favourite thrust, taught him long ago by Barbecue at\\r\\nRio; but to his astonishment he found this thrust turned aside again and again.\\r\\nThen he sought to close and give the quietus with his iron hook, which all this\\r\\ntime had been pawing the air; but Peter doubled under it and, lunging fiercely,\\r\\npierced him in the ribs. At the sight of his own blood, whose peculiar colour,\\r\\nyou remember, was offensive to him, the sword fell from Hook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand, and\\r\\nhe was at Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mercy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNow!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried all the boys, but with a magnificent gesture Peter\\r\\ninvited his opponent to pick up his sword. Hook did so instantly, but with a\\r\\ntragic feeling that Peter was showing good form.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him, but darker suspicions\\r\\nassailed him now.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPan, who and what art thou?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried huskily.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m youth, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m joy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter answered at a venture,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a little bird that has broken out of the egg.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThis, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter\\r\\ndid not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of\\r\\ngood form.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo\\xe2\\x80\\x99t again,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried despairingly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe fought now like a human flail, and every sweep of that terrible sword would\\r\\nhave severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it; but Peter fluttered\\r\\nround him as if the very wind it made blew him out of the danger zone. And\\r\\nagain and again he darted in and pricked.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHook was fighting now without hope. That passionate breast no longer asked for\\r\\nlife; but for one boon it craved: to see Peter show bad form before it was cold\\r\\nforever.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAbandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn two minutes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe ship will be blown to\\r\\npieces.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow, now, he thought, true form will show.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut Peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his hands, and\\r\\ncalmly flung it overboard.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhat sort of form was Hook himself showing? Misguided man though he was, we may\\r\\nbe glad, without sympathising with him, that in the end he was true to the\\r\\ntraditions of his race. The other boys were flying around him now, flouting,\\r\\nscornful; and he staggered about the deck striking up at them impotently, his\\r\\nmind was no longer with them; it was slouching in the playing fields of long\\r\\nago, or being sent up for good, or watching the wall-game from a famous wall.\\r\\nAnd his shoes were right, and his waistcoat was right, and his tie was right,\\r\\nand his socks were right.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nJames Hook, thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor we have come to his last moment.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSeeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger poised, he\\r\\nsprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea. He did not know that the\\r\\ncrocodile was waiting for him; for we purposely stopped the clock that this\\r\\nknowledge might be spared him: a little mark of respect from us at the end.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe had one last triumph, which I think we need not grudge him. As he stood on\\r\\nthe bulwark looking over his shoulder at Peter gliding through the air, he\\r\\ninvited him with a gesture to use his foot. It made Peter kick instead of stab.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAt last Hook had got the boon for which he craved.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBad form,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried jeeringly, and went content to the crocodile.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThus perished James Hook.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSeventeen,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Slightly sang out; but he was not quite correct in his\\r\\nfigures. Fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night; but two reached\\r\\nthe shore: Starkey to be captured by the redskins, who made him nurse for all\\r\\ntheir papooses, a melancholy come-down for a pirate; and Smee, who henceforth\\r\\nwandered about the world in his spectacles, making a precarious living by\\r\\nsaying he was the only man that Jas. Hook had feared.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWendy, of course, had stood by taking no part in the fight, though watching\\r\\nPeter with glistening eyes; but now that all was over she became prominent\\r\\nagain. She praised them equally, and shuddered delightfully when Michael showed\\r\\nher the place where he had killed one; and then she took them into Hook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncabin and pointed to his watch which was hanging on a nail. It said\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chalf-past one!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all. She got them to\\r\\nbed in the pirates\\xe2\\x80\\x99 bunks pretty quickly, you may be sure; all but Peter,\\r\\nwho strutted up and down on the deck, until at last he fell asleep by the side\\r\\nof Long Tom. He had one of his dreams that night, and cried in his sleep for a\\r\\nlong time, and Wendy held him tightly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"chap16\"></a>Chapter XVI.<br>\\r\\nTHE RETURN HOME</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy three bells that morning they were all stirring their stumps; for there was\\r\\na big sea running; and Tootles, the bo\\xe2\\x80\\x99sun, was among them, with a\\r\\nrope\\xe2\\x80\\x99s end in his hand and chewing tobacco. They all donned pirate\\r\\nclothes cut off at the knee, shaved smartly, and tumbled up, with the true\\r\\nnautical roll and hitching their trousers.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt need not be said who was the captain. Nibs and John were first and second\\r\\nmate. There was a woman aboard. The rest were tars before the mast, and lived\\r\\nin the fo\\xe2\\x80\\x99c\\xe2\\x80\\x99sle. Peter had already lashed himself to the wheel; but\\r\\nhe piped all hands and delivered a short address to them; said he hoped they\\r\\nwould do their duty like gallant hearties, but that he knew they were the scum\\r\\nof Rio and the Gold Coast, and if they snapped at him he would tear them. The\\r\\nbluff strident words struck the note sailors understood, and they cheered him\\r\\nlustily. Then a few sharp orders were given, and they turned the ship round,\\r\\nand nosed her for the mainland.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCaptain Pan calculated, after consulting the ship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chart, that if this\\r\\nweather lasted they should strike the Azores about the 21st of June, after\\r\\nwhich it would save time to fly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSome of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in favour of\\r\\nkeeping it a pirate; but the captain treated them as dogs, and they dared not\\r\\nexpress their wishes to him even in a round robin. Instant obedience was the\\r\\nonly safe thing. Slightly got a dozen for looking perplexed when told to take\\r\\nsoundings. The general feeling was that Peter was honest just now to lull\\r\\nWendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suspicions, but that there might be a change when the new suit\\r\\nwas ready, which, against her will, she was making for him out of some of\\r\\nHook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wickedest garments. It was afterwards whispered among them that on\\r\\nthe first night he wore this suit he sat long in the cabin with Hook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncigar-holder in his mouth and one hand clenched, all but for the forefinger,\\r\\nwhich he bent and held threateningly aloft like a hook.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nInstead of watching the ship, however, we must now return to that desolate home\\r\\nfrom which three of our characters had taken heartless flight so long ago. It\\r\\nseems a shame to have neglected No. 14 all this time; and yet we may be sure\\r\\nthat Mrs. Darling does not blame us. If we had returned sooner to look with\\r\\nsorrowful sympathy at her, she would probably have cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be\\r\\nsilly; what do I matter? Do go back and keep an eye on the children.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d So\\r\\nlong as mothers are like this their children will take advantage of them; and\\r\\nthey may lay to that.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEven now we venture into that familiar nursery only because its lawful\\r\\noccupants are on their way home; we are merely hurrying on in advance of them\\r\\nto see that their beds are properly aired and that Mr. and Mrs. Darling do not\\r\\ngo out for the evening. We are no more than servants. Why on earth should their\\r\\nbeds be properly aired, seeing that they left them in such a thankless hurry?\\r\\nWould it not serve them jolly well right if they came back and found that their\\r\\nparents were spending the week-end in the country? It would be the moral lesson\\r\\nthey have been in need of ever since we met them; but if we contrived things in\\r\\nthis way Mrs. Darling would never forgive us.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOne thing I should like to do immensely, and that is to tell her, in the way\\r\\nauthors have, that the children are coming back, that indeed they will be here\\r\\non Thursday week. This would spoil so completely the surprise to which Wendy\\r\\nand John and Michael are looking forward. They have been planning it out on the\\r\\nship: mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rapture, father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shout of joy, Nana\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leap\\r\\nthrough the air to embrace them first, when what they ought to be prepared for\\r\\nis a good hiding. How delicious to spoil it all by breaking the news in\\r\\nadvance; so that when they enter grandly Mrs. Darling may not even offer Wendy\\r\\nher mouth, and Mr. Darling may exclaim pettishly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDash it all, here are\\r\\nthose boys again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d However, we should get no thanks even for this. We are\\r\\nbeginning to know Mrs. Darling by this time, and may be sure that she would\\r\\nupbraid us for depriving the children of their little pleasure.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, my dear madam, it is ten days till Thursday week; so that by\\r\\ntelling you what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what, we can save you ten days of unhappiness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, but at what a cost! By depriving the children of ten minutes of\\r\\ndelight.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, if you look at it in that way!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat other way is there in which to look at it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nYou see, the woman had no proper spirit. I had meant to say extraordinarily\\r\\nnice things about her; but I despise her, and not one of them will I say now.\\r\\nShe does not really need to be told to have things ready, for they are ready.\\r\\nAll the beds are aired, and she never leaves the house, and observe, the window\\r\\nis open. For all the use we are to her, we might well go back to the ship.\\r\\nHowever, as we are here we may as well stay and look on. That is all we are,\\r\\nlookers-on. Nobody really wants us. So let us watch and say jaggy things, in\\r\\nthe hope that some of them will hurt.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe only change to be seen in the night-nursery is that between nine and six\\r\\nthe kennel is no longer there. When the children flew away, Mr. Darling felt in\\r\\nhis bones that all the blame was his for having chained Nana up, and that from\\r\\nfirst to last she had been wiser than he. Of course, as we have seen, he was\\r\\nquite a simple man; indeed he might have passed for a boy again if he had been\\r\\nable to take his baldness off; but he had also a noble sense of justice and a\\r\\nlion\\xe2\\x80\\x99s courage to do what seemed right to him; and having thought the\\r\\nmatter out with anxious care after the flight of the children, he went down on\\r\\nall fours and crawled into the kennel. To all Mrs. Darling\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dear\\r\\ninvitations to him to come out he replied sadly but firmly:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, my own one, this is the place for me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the bitterness of his remorse he swore that he would never leave the kennel\\r\\nuntil his children came back. Of course this was a pity; but whatever Mr.\\r\\nDarling did he had to do in excess, otherwise he soon gave up doing it. And\\r\\nthere never was a more humble man than the once proud George Darling, as he sat\\r\\nin the kennel of an evening talking with his wife of their children and all\\r\\ntheir pretty ways.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nVery touching was his deference to Nana. He would not let her come into the\\r\\nkennel, but on all other matters he followed her wishes implicitly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEvery morning the kennel was carried with Mr. Darling in it to a cab, which\\r\\nconveyed him to his office, and he returned home in the same way at six.\\r\\nSomething of the strength of character of the man will be seen if we remember\\r\\nhow sensitive he was to the opinion of neighbours: this man whose every\\r\\nmovement now attracted surprised attention. Inwardly he must have suffered\\r\\ntorture; but he preserved a calm exterior even when the young criticised his\\r\\nlittle home, and he always lifted his hat courteously to any lady who looked\\r\\ninside.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt may have been Quixotic, but it was magnificent. Soon the inward meaning of\\r\\nit leaked out, and the great heart of the public was touched. Crowds followed\\r\\nthe cab, cheering it lustily; charming girls scaled it to get his autograph;\\r\\ninterviews appeared in the better class of papers, and society invited him to\\r\\ndinner and added, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo come in the kennel.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOn that eventful Thursday week, Mrs. Darling was in the night-nursery awaiting\\r\\nGeorge\\xe2\\x80\\x99s return home; a very sad-eyed woman. Now that we look at her\\r\\nclosely and remember the gaiety of her in the old days, all gone now just\\r\\nbecause she has lost her babes, I find I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to say nasty\\r\\nthings about her after all. If she was too fond of her rubbishy children, she\\r\\ncouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help it. Look at her in her chair, where she has fallen asleep.\\r\\nThe corner of her mouth, where one looks first, is almost withered up. Her hand\\r\\nmoves restlessly on her breast as if she had a pain there. Some like Peter\\r\\nbest, and some like Wendy best, but I like her best. Suppose, to make her\\r\\nhappy, we whisper to her in her sleep that the brats are coming back. They are\\r\\nreally within two miles of the window now, and flying strong, but all we need\\r\\nwhisper is that they are on the way. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt is a pity we did it, for she has started up, calling their names; and there\\r\\nis no one in the room but Nana.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cO Nana, I dreamt my dear ones had come back.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNana had filmy eyes, but all she could do was put her paw gently on her\\r\\nmistress\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lap; and they were sitting together thus when the kennel was\\r\\nbrought back. As Mr. Darling puts his head out to kiss his wife, we see that\\r\\nhis face is more worn than of yore, but has a softer expression.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe gave his hat to Liza, who took it scornfully; for she had no imagination,\\r\\nand was quite incapable of understanding the motives of such a man. Outside,\\r\\nthe crowd who had accompanied the cab home were still cheering, and he was\\r\\nnaturally not unmoved.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cListen to them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is very gratifying.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLots of little boys,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sneered Liza.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere were several adults to-day,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he assured her with a faint\\r\\nflush; but when she tossed her head he had not a word of reproof for her.\\r\\nSocial success had not spoilt him; it had made him sweeter. For some time he\\r\\nsat with his head out of the kennel, talking with Mrs. Darling of this success,\\r\\nand pressing her hand reassuringly when she said she hoped his head would not\\r\\nbe turned by it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut if I had been a weak man,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood heavens, if I\\r\\nhad been a weak man!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd, George,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said timidly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou are as full of remorse\\r\\nas ever, aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFull of remorse as ever, dearest! See my punishment: living in a\\r\\nkennel.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut it is punishment, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it, George? You are sure you are not\\r\\nenjoying it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy love!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nYou may be sure she begged his pardon; and then, feeling drowsy, he curled\\r\\nround in the kennel.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you play me to sleep,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked, \\xe2\\x80\\x9con the nursery\\r\\npiano?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and as she was crossing to the day-nursery he added\\r\\nthoughtlessly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd shut that window. I feel a draught.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cO George, never ask me to do that. The window must always be left open\\r\\nfor them, always, always.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow it was his turn to beg her pardon; and she went into the day-nursery and\\r\\nplayed, and soon he was asleep; and while he slept, Wendy and John and Michael\\r\\nflew into the room.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOh no. We have written it so, because that was the charming arrangement planned\\r\\nby them before we left the ship; but something must have happened since then,\\r\\nfor it is not they who have flown in, it is Peter and Tinker Bell.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first words tell all.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuick Tink,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he whispered, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclose the window; bar it!\\r\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right. Now you and I must get away by the door; and when Wendy\\r\\ncomes she will think her mother has barred her out; and she will have to go\\r\\nback with me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow I understand what had hitherto puzzled me, why when Peter had exterminated\\r\\nthe pirates he did not return to the island and leave Tink to escort the\\r\\nchildren to the mainland. This trick had been in his head all the time.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nInstead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee; then he\\r\\npeeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing. He whispered to Tink,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother! She is a pretty lady, but not so pretty\\r\\nas my mother. Her mouth is full of thimbles, but not so full as my\\r\\nmother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s was.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf course he knew nothing whatever about his mother; but he sometimes bragged\\r\\nabout her.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe did not know the tune, which was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHome, Sweet Home,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but he knew\\r\\nit was saying, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome back, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; and he cried\\r\\nexultantly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou will never see Wendy again, lady, for the window is\\r\\nbarred!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe peeped in again to see why the music had stopped, and now he saw that Mrs.\\r\\nDarling had laid her head on the box, and that two tears were sitting on her\\r\\neyes.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe wants me to unbar the window,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d thought Peter, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut I\\r\\nwon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, not I!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe peeped again, and the tears were still there, or another two had taken their\\r\\nplace.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s awfully fond of Wendy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said to himself. He was\\r\\nangry with her now for not seeing why she could not have Wendy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe reason was so simple: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m fond of her too. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t both\\r\\nhave her, lady.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut the lady would not make the best of it, and he was unhappy. He ceased to\\r\\nlook at her, but even then she would not let go of him. He skipped about and\\r\\nmade funny faces, but when he stopped it was just as if she were inside him,\\r\\nknocking.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, all right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said at last, and gulped. Then he unbarred the\\r\\nwindow. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCome on, Tink,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried, with a frightful sneer at the\\r\\nlaws of nature; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want any silly mothers;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and he\\r\\nflew away.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThus Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for them after all, which\\r\\nof course was more than they deserved. They alighted on the floor, quite\\r\\nunashamed of themselves, and the youngest one had already forgotten his home.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJohn,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, looking around him doubtfully, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think I\\r\\nhave been here before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course you have, you silly. There is your old bed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo it is,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Michael said, but not with much conviction.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI say,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried John, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe kennel!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and he dashed across\\r\\nto look into it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps Nana is inside it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut John whistled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHullo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a man\\r\\ninside it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Wendy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet me see father,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Michael begged eagerly, and he took a good\\r\\nlook. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe is not so big as the pirate I killed,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said with such\\r\\nfrank disappointment that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep; it would have been\\r\\nsad if those had been the first words he heard his little Michael say.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWendy and John had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in the\\r\\nkennel.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSurely,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said John, like one who had lost faith in his memory,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9che used not to sleep in the kennel?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJohn,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy said falteringly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cperhaps we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\r\\nremember the old life as well as we thought we did.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nA chill fell upon them; and serve them right.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is very careless of mother,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said that young scoundrel John,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot to be here when we come back.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was then that Mrs. Darling began playing again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Wendy, peeping.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo it is!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said John.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen are you not really our mother, Wendy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asked Michael, who was\\r\\nsurely sleepy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh dear!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exclaimed Wendy, with her first real twinge of remorse,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cit was quite time we came back.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet us creep in,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d John suggested, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand put our hands over\\r\\nher eyes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut Wendy, who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently, had a\\r\\nbetter plan.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLet us all slip into our beds, and be there when she comes in, just as\\r\\nif we had never been away.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see if her husband\\r\\nwas asleep, all the beds were occupied. The children waited for her cry of joy,\\r\\nbut it did not come. She saw them, but she did not believe they were there. You\\r\\nsee, she saw them in their beds so often in her dreams that she thought this\\r\\nwas just the dream hanging around her still.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe sat down in the chair by the fire, where in the old days she had nursed\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey could not understand this, and a cold fear fell upon all the three of\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMother!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy cried.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Wendy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, but still she was sure it was the\\r\\ndream.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMother!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s John,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMother!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Michael. He knew her now.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Michael,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, and she stretched out her arms\\r\\nfor the three little selfish children they would never envelop again. Yes, they\\r\\ndid, they went round Wendy and John and Michael, who had slipped out of bed and\\r\\nrun to her.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGeorge, George!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried when she could speak; and Mr. Darling\\r\\nwoke to share her bliss, and Nana came rushing in. There could not have been a\\r\\nlovelier sight; but there was none to see it except a little boy who was\\r\\nstaring in at the window. He had had ecstasies innumerable that other children\\r\\ncan never know; but he was looking through the window at the one joy from which\\r\\nhe must be for ever barred.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div class=\"chapter\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"chap17\"></a>Chapter XVII.<br>\\r\\nWHEN WENDY GREW UP</h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI hope you want to know what became of the other boys. They were waiting below\\r\\nto give Wendy time to explain about them; and when they had counted five\\r\\nhundred they went up. They went up by the stair, because they thought this\\r\\nwould make a better impression. They stood in a row in front of Mrs. Darling,\\r\\nwith their hats off, and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes.\\r\\nThey said nothing, but their eyes asked her to have them. They ought to have\\r\\nlooked at Mr. Darling also, but they forgot about him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf course Mrs. Darling said at once that she would have them; but Mr. Darling\\r\\nwas curiously depressed, and they saw that he considered six a rather large\\r\\nnumber.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI must say,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said to Wendy, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do\\r\\nthings by halves,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed\\r\\nat them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe first twin was the proud one, and he asked, flushing, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you think\\r\\nwe should be too much of a handful, sir? Because, if so, we can go away.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFather!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy cried, shocked; but still the cloud was on him. He\\r\\nknew he was behaving unworthily, but he could not help it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe could lie doubled up,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Nibs.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI always cut their hair myself,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Wendy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGeorge!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Darling exclaimed, pained to see her dear one\\r\\nshowing himself in such an unfavourable light.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen he burst into tears, and the truth came out. He was as glad to have them\\r\\nas she was, he said, but he thought they should have asked his consent as well\\r\\nas hers, instead of treating him as a cypher in his own house.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think he is a cypher,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Tootles cried instantly.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you think he is a cypher, Curly?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Do you think he is a cypher, Slightly?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRather not. Twin, what do you think?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher; and he was absurdly\\r\\ngratified, and said he would find space for them all in the drawing-room if\\r\\nthey fitted in.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll fit in, sir,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they assured him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThen follow the leader,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried gaily. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMind you, I am not\\r\\nsure that we have a drawing-room, but we pretend we have, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all\\r\\nthe same. Hoop la!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe went off dancing through the house, and they all cried \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHoop\\r\\nla!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and danced after him, searching for the drawing-room; and I forget\\r\\nwhether they found it, but at any rate they found corners, and they all fitted\\r\\nin.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs for Peter, he saw Wendy once again before he flew away. He did not exactly\\r\\ncome to the window, but he brushed against it in passing so that she could open\\r\\nit if she liked and call to him. That is what she did.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHullo, Wendy, good-bye,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh dear, are you going away?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel, Peter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said falteringly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat\\r\\nyou would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAbout me, Peter?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMrs. Darling came to the window, for at present she was keeping a sharp eye on\\r\\nWendy. She told Peter that she had adopted all the other boys, and would like\\r\\nto adopt him also.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWould you send me to school?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he inquired craftily.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd then to an office?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI suppose so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSoon I would be a man?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cVery soon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to go to school and learn solemn things,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he\\r\\ntold her passionately. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be a man. O Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nmother, if I was to wake up and feel there was a beard!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Wendy the comforter, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI should love you in a\\r\\nbeard;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and Mrs. Darling stretched out her arms to him, but he repulsed\\r\\nher.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cKeep back, lady, no one is going to catch me and make me a man.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut where are you going to live?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith Tink in the house we built for Wendy. The fairies are to put it\\r\\nhigh up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow lovely,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d cried Wendy so longingly that Mrs. Darling tightened\\r\\nher grip.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI thought all the fairies were dead,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mrs. Darling said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are always a lot of young ones,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d explained Wendy, who was\\r\\nnow quite an authority, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbecause you see when a new baby laughs for the\\r\\nfirst time a new fairy is born, and as there are always new babies there are\\r\\nalways new fairies. They live in nests on the tops of trees; and the mauve ones\\r\\nare boys and the white ones are girls, and the blue ones are just little\\r\\nsillies who are not sure what they are.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall have such fun,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Peter, with eye on Wendy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt will be rather lonely in the evening,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csitting\\r\\nby the fire.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI shall have Tink.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTink can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go a twentieth part of the way round,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she\\r\\nreminded him a little tartly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSneaky tell-tale!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Tink called out from somewhere round the\\r\\ncorner.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cO Peter, you know it matters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWell, then, come with me to the little house.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMay I, mummy?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCertainly not. I have got you home again, and I mean to keep you.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut he does so need a mother.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo do you, my love.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOh, all right,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter said, as if he had asked her from politeness\\r\\nmerely; but Mrs. Darling saw his mouth twitch, and she made this handsome\\r\\noffer: to let Wendy go to him for a week every year to do his spring cleaning.\\r\\nWendy would have preferred a more permanent arrangement; and it seemed to her\\r\\nthat spring would be long in coming; but this promise sent Peter away quite gay\\r\\nagain. He had no sense of time, and was so full of adventures that all I have\\r\\ntold you about him is only a halfpenny-worth of them. I suppose it was because\\r\\nWendy knew this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget me, Peter, will you, before spring cleaning time\\r\\ncomes?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf course Peter promised; and then he flew away. He took Mrs. Darling\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\nkiss with him. The kiss that had been for no one else, Peter took quite easily.\\r\\nFunny. But she seemed satisfied.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf course all the boys went to school; and most of them got into Class III, but\\r\\nSlightly was put first into Class IV and then into Class V. Class I is the top\\r\\nclass. Before they had attended school a week they saw what goats they had been\\r\\nnot to remain on the island; but it was too late now, and soon they settled\\r\\ndown to being as ordinary as you or me or Jenkins minor. It is sad to have to\\r\\nsay that the power to fly gradually left them. At first Nana tied their feet to\\r\\nthe bed-posts so that they should not fly away in the night; and one of their\\r\\ndiversions by day was to pretend to fall off buses; but by and by they ceased\\r\\nto tug at their bonds in bed, and found that they hurt themselves when they let\\r\\ngo of the bus. In time they could not even fly after their hats. Want of\\r\\npractice, they called it; but what it really meant was that they no longer\\r\\nbelieved.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMichael believed longer than the other boys, though they jeered at him; so he\\r\\nwas with Wendy when Peter came for her at the end of the first year. She flew\\r\\naway with Peter in the frock she had woven from leaves and berries in the\\r\\nNeverland, and her one fear was that he might notice how short it had become;\\r\\nbut he never noticed, he had so much to say about himself.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times, but new\\r\\nadventures had crowded the old ones from his mind.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho is Captain Hook?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked with interest when she spoke of the\\r\\narch enemy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you remember,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she asked, amazed, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow you\\r\\nkilled him and saved all our lives?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI forget them after I kill them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he replied carelessly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be glad to see her he\\r\\nsaid, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWho is Tinker Bell?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cO Peter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, shocked; but even when she explained he could\\r\\nnot remember.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere are such a lot of them,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI expect she is no\\r\\nmore.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nI expect he was right, for fairies don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t live long, but they are so\\r\\nlittle that a short time seems a good while to them.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to Peter;\\r\\nit had seemed such a long year of waiting to her. But he was exactly as\\r\\nfascinating as ever, and they had a lovely spring cleaning in the little house\\r\\non the tree tops.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNext year he did not come for her. She waited in a new frock because the old\\r\\none simply would not meet; but he never came.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps he is ill,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Michael said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou know he is never ill.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMichael came close to her and whispered, with a shiver, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPerhaps there is\\r\\nno such person, Wendy!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and then Wendy would have cried if Michael had\\r\\nnot been crying.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter came next spring cleaning; and the strange thing was that he never knew\\r\\nhe had missed a year.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThat was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him. For a little longer she\\r\\ntried for his sake not to have growing pains; and she felt she was untrue to\\r\\nhim when she got a prize for general knowledge. But the years came and went\\r\\nwithout bringing the careless boy; and when they met again Wendy was a married\\r\\nwoman, and Peter was no more to her than a little dust in the box in which she\\r\\nhad kept her toys. Wendy was grown up. You need not be sorry for her. She was\\r\\none of the kind that likes to grow up. In the end she grew up of her own free\\r\\nwill a day quicker than other girls.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAll the boys were grown up and done for by this time; so it is scarcely worth\\r\\nwhile saying anything more about them. You may see the twins and Nibs and Curly\\r\\nany day going to an office, each carrying a little bag and an umbrella. Michael\\r\\nis an engine-driver. Slightly married a lady of title, and so he became a lord.\\r\\nYou see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door? That used to be\\r\\nTootles. The bearded man who doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know any story to tell his children\\r\\nwas once John.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWendy was married in white with a pink sash. It is strange to think that Peter\\r\\ndid not alight in the church and forbid the banns.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nYears rolled on again, and Wendy had a daughter. This ought not to be written\\r\\nin ink but in a golden splash.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe was called Jane, and always had an odd inquiring look, as if from the\\r\\nmoment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions. When she was\\r\\nold enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan. She loved to hear of\\r\\nPeter, and Wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from which\\r\\nthe famous flight had taken place. It was Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nursery now, for her\\r\\nfather had bought it at the three per cents from Wendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father, who was\\r\\nno longer fond of stairs. Mrs. Darling was now dead and forgotten.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere were only two beds in the nursery now, Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and her\\r\\nnurse\\xe2\\x80\\x99s; and there was no kennel, for Nana also had passed away. She died\\r\\nof old age, and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with; being\\r\\nvery firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except\\r\\nherself.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOnce a week Jane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nurse had her evening off; and then it was\\r\\nWendy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s part to put Jane to bed. That was the time for stories. It was\\r\\nJane\\xe2\\x80\\x99s invention to raise the sheet over her mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head and her\\r\\nown, thus making a tent, and in the awful darkness to whisper:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat do we see now?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I see anything to-night,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Wendy, with a\\r\\nfeeling that if Nana were here she would object to further conversation.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, you do,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Jane, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou see when you were a little\\r\\ngirl.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is a long time ago, sweetheart,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Wendy. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh me,\\r\\nhow time flies!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDoes it fly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d asks the artful child, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe way you flew when\\r\\nyou were a little girl?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe way I flew? Do you know, Jane, I sometimes wonder whether I ever did\\r\\nreally fly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, you did.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe dear old days when I could fly!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you fly now, mother?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause I am grown up, dearest. When people grow up they forget the\\r\\nway.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy do they forget the way?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless. It is only\\r\\nthe gay and innocent and heartless who can fly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is gay and innocent and heartless? I do wish I were gay and\\r\\ninnocent and heartless.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOr perhaps Wendy admits she does see something.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do believe,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she says, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat it is this nursery.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do believe it is,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Jane. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGo on.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThey are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when Peter flew in\\r\\nlooking for his shadow.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe foolish fellow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Wendy, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctried to stick it on with\\r\\nsoap, and when he could not he cried, and that woke me, and I sewed it on for\\r\\nhim.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou have missed a bit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d interrupts Jane, who now knows the story\\r\\nbetter than her mother. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen you saw him sitting on the floor crying,\\r\\nwhat did you say?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI sat up in bed and I said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Boy, why are you\\r\\ncrying?\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, that was it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d says Jane, with a big breath.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAnd then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the\\r\\npirates and the redskins and the mermaids\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lagoon, and the home under the\\r\\nground, and the little house.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes! which did you like best of all?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI think I liked the home under the ground best of all.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, so do I. What was the last thing Peter ever said to you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe last thing he ever said to me was, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Just always be waiting for\\r\\nme, and then some night you will hear me crowing.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBut, alas, he forgot all about me,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy said it with a smile.\\r\\nShe was as grown up as that.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat did his crow sound like?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jane asked one evening.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt was like this,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy said, trying to imitate Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ncrow.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jane said gravely, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit was like\\r\\nthis;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and she did it ever so much better than her mother.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWendy was a little startled. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy darling, how can you know?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI often hear it when I am sleeping,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jane said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh yes, many girls hear it when they are sleeping, but I was the only\\r\\none who heard it awake.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLucky you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jane.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAnd then one night came the tragedy. It was the spring of the year, and the\\r\\nstory had been told for the night, and Jane was now asleep in her bed. Wendy\\r\\nwas sitting on the floor, very close to the fire, so as to see to darn, for\\r\\nthere was no other light in the nursery; and while she sat darning she heard a\\r\\ncrow. Then the window blew open as of old, and Peter dropped in on the floor.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe was exactly the same as ever, and Wendy saw at once that he still had all\\r\\nhis first teeth.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHe was a little boy, and she was grown up. She huddled by the fire not daring\\r\\nto move, helpless and guilty, a big woman.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHullo, Wendy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said, not noticing any difference, for he was\\r\\nthinking chiefly of himself; and in the dim light her white dress might have\\r\\nbeen the nightgown in which he had seen her first.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHullo, Peter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she replied faintly, squeezing herself as small as\\r\\npossible. Something inside her was crying \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWoman, Woman, let go of\\r\\nme.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHullo, where is John?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked, suddenly missing the third bed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cJohn is not here now,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she gasped.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs Michael asleep?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked, with a careless glance at Jane.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she answered; and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane\\r\\nas well as to Peter.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is not Michael,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said quickly, lest a judgment should\\r\\nfall on her.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter looked. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHullo, is it a new one?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBoy or girl?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGirl.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNow surely he would understand; but not a bit of it.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, faltering, \\xe2\\x80\\x9care you expecting me to fly\\r\\naway with you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOf course; that is why I have come.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He added a little sternly,\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHave you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning times pass.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said apologetically, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have\\r\\nforgotten how to fly.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll soon teach you again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cO Peter, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t waste the fairy dust on me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe had risen; and now at last a fear assailed him. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\nhe cried, shrinking.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI will turn up the light,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand then you can see\\r\\nfor yourself.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor almost the only time in his life that I know of, Peter was afraid.\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t turn up the light,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy. She was not a little girl\\r\\nheart-broken about him; she was a grown woman smiling at it all, but they were\\r\\nwet-eyed smiles.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen she turned up the light, and Peter saw. He gave a cry of pain; and when\\r\\nthe tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew back\\r\\nsharply.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is it?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he cried again.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShe had to tell him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am old, Peter. I am ever so much more than twenty. I grew up long\\r\\nago.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou promised not to!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help it. I am a married woman, Peter.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, and the little girl in the bed is my baby.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut he supposed she was; and he took a step towards the sleeping child with his\\r\\ndagger upraised. Of course he did not strike. He sat down on the floor instead\\r\\nand sobbed; and Wendy did not know how to comfort him, though she could have\\r\\ndone it so easily once. She was only a woman now, and she ran out of the room\\r\\nto try to think.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter continued to cry, and soon his sobs woke Jane. She sat up in bed, and was\\r\\ninterested at once.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBoy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhy are you crying?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPeter rose and bowed to her, and she bowed to him from the bed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHullo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHullo,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jane.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMy name is Peter Pan,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he told her.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, I know.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI came back for my mother,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he explained, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto take her to\\r\\nthe Neverland.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, I know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jane said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI have been waiting for\\r\\nyou.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen Wendy returned diffidently she found Peter sitting on the bed-post crowing\\r\\ngloriously, while Jane in her nighty was flying round the room in solemn\\r\\necstasy.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cShe is my mother,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Peter explained; and Jane descended and stood\\r\\nby his side, with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when they\\r\\ngazed at him.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHe does so need a mother,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jane said.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes, I know,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy admitted rather forlornly; \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno one knows\\r\\nit so well as I.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood-bye,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Peter to Wendy; and he rose in the air, and the\\r\\nshameless Jane rose with him; it was already her easiest way of moving about.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWendy rushed to the window.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo, no,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she cried.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is just for spring cleaning time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jane said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9che wants\\r\\nme always to do his spring cleaning.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf only I could go with you,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Wendy sighed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cYou see you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said Jane.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf course in the end Wendy let them fly away together. Our last glimpse of her\\r\\nshows her at the window, watching them receding into the sky until they were as\\r\\nsmall as stars.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs you look at Wendy, you may see her hair becoming white, and her figure\\r\\nlittle again, for all this happened long ago. Jane is now a common grown-up,\\r\\nwith a daughter called Margaret; and every spring cleaning time, except when he\\r\\nforgets, Peter comes for Margaret and takes her to the Neverland, where she\\r\\ntells him stories about himself, to which he listens eagerly. When Margaret\\r\\ngrows up she will have a daughter, who is to be Peter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother in turn;\\r\\nand thus it will go on, so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"center\">\\r\\nTHE END\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</div><p><!--end chapter-->\\r\\n</p><div style=\"display:block;margin-top:4em\"></div><section class=\"pg-boilerplate pgheader\" id=\"pg-footer\" lang=\"en\">\\r\\n        <div style=\"text-align:center\">\\r\\n            <span>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PETER PAN ***</span>\\r\\n        </div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one\\xe2\\x80\\x94the old editions will\\r\\nbe renamed.\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\\r\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\r\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\r\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\r\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\r\\nroyalties.

The\\r\\nearly Christmas snowstorm had driven in every bum\\r\\nwho could steal or beg the price of admission, and the\\r\\nlong rows of cots were filled with fully clothed figures.\\r\\nThose who could afford the extra dime were huddled\\r\\nunder thin, grimy blankets.</p>\\r\\n<p>The pariah who had been Dr. Daniel Feldman enjoyed\\r\\nno such luxury. He tossed fitfully on a bare cot, bringing\\r\\nhis face into the dim light. It had been a handsome\\r\\nface, but now the black stubble of beard lay over gaunt\\r\\nfeatures and sunken cheeks. He looked ten years older\\r\\nthan his scant thirty-two, and there <ins class=\"correction\" title=\"Transcriber\\'s Note: Original had \\'was\\'.\">were</ins> the beginnings\\r\\nof a snarl at the corners of his mouth. Clothes that had\\r\\nonce been expensive were wrinkled and covered with\\r\\ngrime that no amount of cleaning could remove. His\\r\\ntall, thin body was awkwardly curled up in a vain effort\\r\\nto conserve heat and one of his hands instinctively\\r\\nclutched at his tiny bag of possessions.</p>\\r\\n<p>He stirred again, and suddenly jerked upright with a\\r\\nprotest already forming on his lips. The ugly surroundings\\r\\nregistered on his eyes, and he stared suspiciously\\r\\nat the other cots. But there was no sign that anyone had\\r\\nbeen trying to rob him of his bindle or the precious\\r\\nbag of cheap tobacco.</p>\\r\\n<p>He started to relax back onto the couch when a sound\\r\\ncaught his attention, even over the snoring of the others.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_6\">[Pg 6]</a></span>\\r\\nIt was a low wail, the sound of a man who can no longer\\r\\ncontrol himself.</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman swung to the cot on his left as the moan\\r\\nhacked off. The man there was well fed and clean-shaven,\\r\\nbut his face was gray with sickness. He was\\r\\nwrithing and clutching his stomach, arching his back\\r\\nagainst the misery inside him.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Space-stomach?\" Feldman diagnosed.</p>\\r\\n<p>He had no need of the weak answering nod. He\\'d\\r\\ntreated such cases several times in the past. The disease\\r\\nwas usually caused by the absence of gravity out in\\r\\nspace, but it could be brought on later from abuse of\\r\\nthe weakened internal organs, such as the intake of too\\r\\nmuch bad liquor. The man must have been frequenting\\r\\nthe wrong space-front bars.</p>\\r\\n<p>Now he was obviously dying. Violent peristaltic contractions\\r\\nseemed to be tearing the intestines out of him,\\r\\nand the paroxysms were coming faster. His eyes darted\\r\\nto Feldman\\'s tobacco sack and there was animal appeal\\r\\nin them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman hesitated, then reluctantly rolled a smoke. He\\r\\nheld the cigarette while the spaceman took a long, gasping\\r\\ndrag on it. He smoked the remainder himself, letting\\r\\nthe harsh tobacco burn against his lungs and sicken\\r\\nhis empty stomach. Then he shrugged and threaded his\\r\\nway through the narrow aisles toward the attendant.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Better get a doctor,\" he said bitterly, when the young\\r\\npunk looked up at him. \"You\\'ve got a man dying of\\r\\nspace-stomach on 214.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The sneer on the kid\\'s face deepened. \"Yeah? We\\r\\ndon\\'t pay for doctors every time some wino wants to\\r\\nthrow up. Forget it and get back where you belong,\\r\\nbo.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You\\'ll have a corpse on your hands in an hour,\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_7\">[Pg 7]</a></span>\\r\\nFeldman insisted. \"I know space-stomach, damn it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The kid turned back to his lottery sheet. \"Go treat\\r\\nyourself if you wanta play doctor. Go on, scram\\xe2\\x80\\x94before\\r\\nI toss you out in the snow!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>One of Feldman\\'s white-knuckled hands reached for\\r\\nthe attendant. Then he caught himself. He started to\\r\\nturn back, hesitated, and finally faced the kid again.\\r\\n\"I\\'m not fooling. And I <i>was</i> a doctor,\" he stated. \"My\\r\\nname is Daniel Feldman.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The attendant nodded absently, until the words finally\\r\\npenetrated. He looked up, studied Feldman with surprised\\r\\ncuriosity and growing contempt, and reached for\\r\\nthe phone. \"Gimme Medical Directory,\" he muttered.</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman felt the kid\\'s eyes on his back as he stumbled\\r\\nthrough the aisles to his cot again. He slumped down,\\r\\nrolling another cigarette in hands that shook. The sick\\r\\nman was approaching delirium now, and the moans were\\r\\nmixed with weak whining sounds of fear. Other men\\r\\nhad wakened and were watching, but nobody made a\\r\\nmove to help.</p>\\r\\n<p>The retching and writhing of the sick man had begun\\r\\nto weaken, but it was still not too late to save him.\\r\\nHot water and skillful massage could interrupt the paroxysms.\\r\\nIn fifteen minutes, Feldman could have stopped\\r\\nthe attack completely.</p>\\r\\n<p>He found his feet on the floor and his hands already\\r\\nreaching out. Savagely he pulled himself back. Sure, he\\r\\ncould save the man\\xe2\\x80\\x94and wind up in the gas chamber!\\r\\nThere\\'d be no mercy for his second offense against\\r\\nLobby laws. If the spaceman lived, Feldman might get\\r\\noff with a flogging\\xe2\\x80\\x94that was standard punishment for\\r\\na pariah who stepped out of line. But with his luck,\\r\\nthere would be a heart arrest and another juicy story\\r\\nfor the papers.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_8\">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>Idealism! The Medical Lobby made a lot out of the\\r\\nword. But it wasn\\'t for him. A pariah had no business\\r\\nthinking of others.</p>\\r\\n<p>As Feldman sat there staring, the spaceman grew\\r\\nquieter. Sometimes, even at this stage, massage could\\r\\nhelp. It was harder without liberal supplies of hot water,\\r\\nbut the massage was the really important treatment. It\\r\\nwas the trembling of Feldman\\'s hands that stopped him.\\r\\nHe no longer had the strength or the certainty to make\\r\\nthe massage effective.</p>\\r\\n<p>He was glaring at his hands in self-disgust when the\\r\\nlegal doctor arrived. The man was old and tired. Probably\\r\\nhe had been another idealist who had wound up\\r\\ndefeated, content to leave things up to the established\\r\\nprocedures of the Medical Lobby. He looked it as he\\r\\nbent over the dying man.</p>\\r\\n<p>The doctor turned back at last to the attendant. \"Too\\r\\nlate. The best I can do is ease his pain. The call should\\r\\nhave been made half an hour earlier.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He had obviously never handled space-stomach before.\\r\\nHe administered a hypo that probably held narconal.\\r\\nFeldman watched, his guts tightening sympathetically\\r\\nfor the shock that would be to the sick man. But\\r\\nat least it would shorten his sufferings. The final seizure\\r\\nlasted only a minute or so.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Hopeless,\" the doctor said. His eyes were clouded\\r\\nfor a moment, and then he shrugged. \"Well, I\\'ll make\\r\\nout a death certificate. Anyone here know his name?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>His eyes swung about the cots until they came to rest\\r\\non Feldman. He frowned, and a twisted smile curved\\r\\nhis lips.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Feldman, isn\\'t it? You still look something like your\\r\\npictures. Do you know the deceased?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman shook his head bitterly. \"No. I don\\'t know<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_9\">[Pg 9]</a></span>\\r\\nhis name. I don\\'t even know why he wasn\\'t cyanotic at\\r\\nthe end, <i>if</i> it was space-stomach. Do you, doctor?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The old man threw a startled glance at the corpse.\\r\\nThen he shrugged and nodded to the attendant. \"Well,\\r\\ngo through his things. If he still has a space ticket, I\\r\\ncan get his name from that.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The kid began pawing through the bag that had fallen\\r\\nfrom the cot. He dragged out a pair of shoes, half a\\r\\nbottle of cheap rum, a wallet and a bronze space ticket.\\r\\nHe wasn\\'t quick enough with the wallet, and the doctor\\r\\ntook it from him.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Medical Lobby authorization. If he has any money,\\r\\nit covers my fee and the rest goes to his own Lobby.\"\\r\\nThere were several bills, all of large denominations. He\\r\\nturned the ticket over and began filling in the death\\r\\ncertificate. \"Arthur Billings. Space Lobby. Crewman.\\r\\nCause of death, <ins class=\"correction\" title=\"Transcriber\\'s Note: Original had \\'ideopathic gastroentiritis\\'.\">idiopathic gastroenteritis</ins> <i>and</i> delirium\\r\\ntremens.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>There had been no evidence of delirium tremens, but\\r\\napparently the doctor felt he had scored a point. He\\r\\ntossed the space ticket toward the shoes, closed his bag,\\r\\nand prepared to leave.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Hey, doc!\" The attendant\\'s voice was indignant.\\r\\n\"Hey, what about my reporting fee?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The doctor stopped. He glanced at the kid, then toward\\r\\nFeldman, his face a mixture of speculation and\\r\\ndislike. He took a dollar bill from the wallet. \"That\\'s\\r\\nright,\" he admitted. \"The fee for reporting a solvent\\r\\ncase. Medical Lobby rules apply\\xe2\\x80\\x94even to a man who\\r\\nbreaks them.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The kid\\'s hand was out, but the doctor dropped the\\r\\ndollar onto Feldman\\'s cot. \"There\\'s your fee, pariah.\"\\r\\nHe left, forcing the protesting attendant to precede him.</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman reached for the bill. It was blood money for<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_10\">[Pg 10]</a></span>\\r\\nletting a man die\\xe2\\x80\\x94but it meant cigarettes and food\\xe2\\x80\\x94or\\r\\nshelter for another night, if he could get a mission meal.\\r\\nHe no longer could afford pride. Grimly, he pocketed\\r\\nthe bill, staring at the face of the dead man. It looked\\r\\nback sightlessly, now showing a faint speckling of tiny\\r\\ndots. They caught Feldman\\'s eyes, and he bent closer.\\r\\nThere should be no black dots on the skin of a man\\r\\nwho died of space-stomach. And there should have been\\r\\ncyanosis....</p>\\r\\n<p>He swore and bent down to find the wrecks of his\\r\\nshoes. He couldn\\'t worry about anything now but getting\\r\\naway from here before the attendant made trouble.\\r\\nHis eyes rested on the shoes of the dead man\\xe2\\x80\\x94sturdy\\r\\nboots that would last for another year. They could do\\r\\nthe corpse no good; someone else would steal them if he\\r\\ndidn\\'t. But he hesitated, cursing himself.</p>\\r\\n<p>The right boot fitted better than he could have expected,\\r\\nbut something got in the way as he tried to put\\r\\nthe left one on. His fingers found the bronze ticket. He\\r\\nturned it over, considering it. He wasn\\'t ready to fraud\\r\\nhis identity for what he\\'d heard of life on the spaceships,\\r\\nyet. But he shoved it into his pocket and finished\\r\\nlacing the boots.</p>\\r\\n<p>Outside, the snow was still falling, but it had turned\\r\\nto slush, and the sidewalk was soggy underfoot. There\\r\\nwas going to be no work shoveling snow, he realized.\\r\\nThis would melt before the day was over. Feldman\\r\\nhunched the suitcoat up, shivering as the cold bit into\\r\\nhim. The boots felt good, though; if he\\'d had socks,\\r\\nthey would have been completely comfortable.</p>\\r\\n<p>He passed a cheap restaurant, and the smell of the\\r\\nsynthetics set his stomach churning. It had been two\\r\\ndays since his last real meal, and the dollar burned in\\r\\nhis pocket. But he had to wait. There was a fair chance<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_11\">[Pg 11]</a></span>\\r\\nthis early that he could scavenge something edible.</p>\\r\\n<p>He shuffled on. After a while, the cold bothered him\\r\\nless, and he passed through the hunger spell. He rolled\\r\\nanother smoke and sucked at it, hardly thinking. It was\\r\\nbetter that way.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was much later when the big caduceus set into the\\r\\nsidewalk snapped him back to awareness of where he\\'d\\r\\ntraveled. His undirected feet had led him much too far\\r\\nuptown, following old habits. This was the Medical\\r\\nLobby building, where he\\'d spent more than enough\\r\\ntime, including three weeks in custody before they\\r\\nstripped him of all rank and status.</p>\\r\\n<p>His eyes wandered to the ornate entrance where he\\'d\\r\\nfirst emerged as a pariah. He\\'d meant to walk down\\r\\nthose steps as if he were still a man. But each step had\\r\\ndrained his resolution, until he\\'d finally covered his face\\r\\nand slunk off, knowing himself for what the world had\\r\\nbranded him.</p>\\r\\n<p>He stood there now, staring at the smug young medical\\r\\npoliticians and the tired old general practitioners\\r\\nfiling in and out. One of the latter halted, fumbled in\\r\\nhis pocket and drew out a quarter.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Merry Christmas!\" he said dully.</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman fingered the coin. Then he saw a gray Medical\\r\\npoliceman watching him, and he knew it was time\\r\\nto move on. Sooner or later, someone would recognize\\r\\nhim here.</p>\\r\\n<p>He clutched the quarter and turned to look for a coffee\\r\\nshop that sold the synthetics to which his metabolism\\r\\nhad been switched. No shop would serve him here,\\r\\nbut he could buy coffee and a piece of cake to take out.</p>\\r\\n<p>A flurry of motion registered from the corner of his\\r\\neye, and he glanced back.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_12\">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"Taxi! Taxi!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The girl rushing down the steps had a clear soprano\\r\\nvoice, cultured and commanding. The gray Medical uniform\\r\\nseemed molded to her shapely figure and her red\\r\\nhair glistened in the lights of the street. Her snub nose\\r\\nand determined mouth weren\\'t the current fashion, but\\r\\nnobody stopped to think of fashions when they saw her.\\r\\nShe didn\\'t have to be the daughter of the president of\\r\\nMedical Lobby to rule.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was Chris\\xe2\\x80\\x94Chris Feldman once, and now Chris\\r\\nRyan again.</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman swung toward a cab. For a moment, his attitude\\r\\nwas automatic and assured, and the cab stopped\\r\\nbefore the driver noticed his clothes. He picked up the\\r\\nbag Chris dropped and swung it onto the front seat.\\r\\nShe was fumbling in her change purse as he turned back\\r\\nto shut the door.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Thank you, my good man,\" she said. She could be\\r\\ngracious, even to a pariah, when his homage suited her.\\r\\nShe dropped two quarters into his hand, raising her eyes.</p>\\r\\n<p>Recognition flowed into them, followed by icy shock.\\r\\nShe yanked the cab door shut and shouted something to\\r\\nthe driver. The cab took off with a rush that left Feldman\\r\\nin a backwash of slush and mud.</p>\\r\\n<p>He glanced down at the coins in his hand. It was his\\r\\nlucky day, he thought bitterly.</p>\\r\\n<p>He moved across the street and away, not bothering\\r\\nabout the squeal of brakes and the honking horns. He\\r\\nlooked back only once, toward the glowing sign that\\r\\ntopped the building. <i>Your health is our business!</i> Then\\r\\nthe great symbol of the health business faded behind\\r\\nhim, and he stumbled on, sucking incessantly at the\\r\\ncigarettes he rolled. One hand clutched the bronze<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_13\">[Pg 13]</a></span>\\r\\nbadge belonging to the dead man and his stolen boots\\r\\ndrove onward through the melting snow.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was Christmas in the year 2100 on the protectorate\\r\\nof Earth.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_14\">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"II\"></a>II</h2>\\r\\n<h3>Lobby</h3>\\r\\n<p>Feldman had set his legs the problem of heading for\\r\\nthe great spaceport and escape from Earth, and he let\\r\\nthem take him without further guidance. His mind was\\r\\nwrapped up in a whirl of the past\\xe2\\x80\\x94his past and that of\\r\\nthe whole planet. Both pasts had in common the growth\\r\\nand sudden ruin of idealism.</p>\\r\\n<p>Idealism! Throughout history, some men had sought\\r\\nthe ideal, and most had called it freedom. Only fools expected\\r\\nabsolute freedom, but wise men dreamed up\\r\\nmany systems of relative freedom, including democracy.\\r\\nThey had tried that in America, as the last fling\\r\\nof the dream. It had been a good attempt, too.</p>\\r\\n<p>The men who drew the Constitution had been pretty\\r\\npractical dreamers. They came to their task after a bitter\\r\\nwar and a worse period of wild chaos, and they had\\r\\nlearned where idealism stopped and idiocy began. They\\r\\nset up a republic with all the elements of democracy\\r\\nthat they considered safe. It had worked well enough\\r\\nto make America the number one power of the world.\\r\\nBut the men who followed the framers of the new plan\\r\\nwere a different sort, without the knowledge of practical\\r\\nlimits.</p>\\r\\n<p>The privileges their ancestors had earned in blood\\r\\nand care became automatic rights. Practical men tried\\r\\nto explain that there were no such rights\\xe2\\x80\\x94that each generation\\r\\nhad to pay for its rights with responsibility. That<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_15\">[Pg 15]</a></span>\\r\\nkind of talk didn\\'t get far. People wanted to hear about\\r\\nrights, not about duties.</p>\\r\\n<p>They took the phrase that all men were created equal\\r\\nand left out the implied kicker that equality was in the\\r\\nsight of God and before the law. They wanted an equality\\r\\nwith the greatest men without giving up their drive\\r\\ntoward mediocrity, and they meant to have it. In a way,\\r\\nthey got it.</p>\\r\\n<p>They got the vote extended to everyone. The man\\r\\non subsidy or public dole could vote to demand more.\\r\\nThe man who read of nothing beyond sex crimes could\\r\\nvote on the great political issues of the world. No ability\\r\\nwas needed for his vote. In fact, he was assured\\r\\nthat voting alone was enough to make him a fine and\\r\\nnoble citizen. He loved that, if he bothered to vote at\\r\\nall that year. He became a great man by listing his unthought,\\r\\nhungry desire for someone to take care of him\\r\\nwithout responsibility. So he went out and voted for\\r\\nthe man who promised him most, or who looked most\\r\\nlike what his limited dreams felt to be a father image or\\r\\nson image or hero image. He never bothered later to\\r\\nsee how the men he\\'d elected had handled the jobs he\\r\\nhad given them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Someone had to look, of course, and someone did. Organized\\r\\nspecial interests stepped in where the mob had\\r\\nfailed. Lobbies grew up. There had always been pressure\\r\\ngroups, but now they developed into a third arm\\r\\nof the government.</p>\\r\\n<p>The old Farm Lobby was unbeatable. The big farmers\\r\\nshaped the laws they wanted. They convinced the\\r\\nlittle farmers it was for the good of all, and they made\\r\\nthe story stick well enough to swing the farm vote.\\r\\nThey made the laws when it came to food and crops.</p>\\r\\n<p>The last of the great lobbies was Space, probably. It<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_16\">[Pg 16]</a></span>\\r\\nwas an accident that grew up so fast it never even knew\\r\\nit wasn\\'t a real part of the government. It developed\\r\\nduring a period of chaos when another country called\\r\\nRussia got the first hunk of metal above the atmosphere\\r\\nand when the representatives who had been picked for\\r\\neverything but their grasp of science and government\\r\\nwent into panic over a myth of national prestige.</p>\\r\\n<p>The space effort was turned over to the aircraft industry,\\r\\nwhich had never been able to manage itself successfully\\r\\nexcept under the stimulus of war or a threat\\r\\nof war. The failing airplane industry became the space\\r\\ncombine overnight, and nobody kept track of how big\\r\\nit was, except a few sharp operators.</p>\\r\\n<p>They worked out a system of subcontracts that spread\\r\\nthe profits so wide that hardly a company of any size in\\r\\nthe country wasn\\'t getting a share. Thus a lot of patriotic,\\r\\nnoble voters got their pay from companies in the\\r\\nlobby block and could be panicked by the lobby at the\\r\\nfirst mention of recession.</p>\\r\\n<p>So Space Lobby took over completely in its own field.\\r\\nIt developed enough pressure to get whatever appropriations\\r\\nit wanted, even over Presidential veto. It created\\r\\nthe only space experts, which meant that the men placed\\r\\nin government agencies to regulate it came from its own\\r\\nranks.</p>\\r\\n<p>The other lobbies learned a lot from Space.</p>\\r\\n<p>There had been a medical lobby long before, but it\\r\\nhad been a conservative group, mostly concerned with\\r\\nprotecting medical autonomy and ethics. It also tried to\\r\\nprevent government control of treatment and payment,\\r\\nfeeling that it couldn\\'t trust the people to know where\\r\\nto stop. But its history was a long series of retreats.</p>\\r\\n<p>It fought what it called socialized medicine. But the\\r\\npeople wanted their troubles handled free\\xe2\\x80\\x94which meant<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_17\">[Pg 17]</a></span>\\r\\nby government spending, since that could be added to\\r\\nthe national debt, and thus didn\\'t seem to cost anything.\\r\\nIt lost, and eventually the government paid most medical\\r\\ncosts, with doctors working on a fixed fee. Then\\r\\nquantity of treatment paid, rather than quality. Competence\\r\\nno longer mattered so much. The Lobby lost,\\r\\nbut didn\\'t know it\\xe2\\x80\\x94because the lowered standards of\\r\\ncompetence in the profession lowered the caliber of\\r\\nmen running the political aspects of that profession as\\r\\nexemplified by the Lobby.</p>\\r\\n<p>It took a world-wide plague to turn the tide. The\\r\\nplague began in old China; anything could start there,\\r\\nwith more than a billion people huddled in one area\\r\\nand a few madmen planning to conquer the world. It\\r\\nmight have been a laboratory mutation, but nobody\\r\\ncould ever prove it.</p>\\r\\n<p>It wiped out two billion people, depopulated Africa\\r\\nand most of Asia, and wrecked Europe, leaving only\\r\\nAmerica comparatively safe to take over. An obscure\\r\\nscientist in one of the laboratories run by the Medical\\r\\nLobby found a cure before the first waves of the epidemic\\r\\nhit America. Rutherford Ryan, then head of the\\r\\nLobby, made sure that Medical Lobby got all the credit.</p>\\r\\n<p>By the time the world recovered, America ran it and\\r\\nthe Medical Lobby was untouchable. Ryan made a deal\\r\\nwith Space Lobby, and the two effectively ran the\\r\\nworld. None of the smaller lobbies could buck them,\\r\\nand neither could the government.</p>\\r\\n<p>There was still a president and a congress, as there\\r\\nhad been a Senate under the Roman Caesars. But the\\r\\ntwo Lobbies ran themselves as they chose. The real\\r\\ngovernment had become a kind of oligarchy, as it always\\r\\ndid after too much false democracy ruined the\\r\\nideals of real and practical self-rule. A man belonged to<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_18\">[Pg 18]</a></span>\\r\\nhis Lobby, just as a serf had belonged to his feudal landlord.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was a safe world now. Maybe progress had been\\r\\nhalted at about the level of 1980, but so long as the citizens\\r\\ndidn\\'t break the rules of their lobbies, they had\\r\\nvery little to worry about. For that, for security and the\\r\\nright not to think, most people were willing to leave\\r\\nwell enough alone.</p>\\r\\n<p>Some rules seemed harsh, of course, such as the law\\r\\nthat all operations had to be performed in Lobby hospitals.\\r\\nBut that could be justified; it was the only safe\\r\\nkind of surgery and the only way to make sure there\\r\\nwas no unsupervised experimentation, such as that which\\r\\nsupposedly caused the plague. The rule was now an absolute\\r\\nethic of medicine. It also made for better fees.</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman\\'s father had stuck by the rule but had questioned\\r\\nit. Feldman learned not to question in medical\\r\\nschool. He scored second in Medical Ethics only to\\r\\nChristina Ryan.</p>\\r\\n<p>He had never figured why she singled him out for her\\r\\nattentions, but he gloried in both those attentions and\\r\\nthe results. He became automatically a rising young\\r\\nman, the favorite of the daughter of the Lobby president.\\r\\nHe went through internship without a sign of\\r\\ntrouble. Chris humored him in his desire to spend three\\r\\nyears of practice in a poor section loaded with disease,\\r\\nand her father approved; such selfless dedication was\\r\\nthe perfect image projection for a future son-in-law. In\\r\\nreturn, he agreed to follow that period by becoming\\r\\nan administrator. A doctor\\'s doctor, as they put it.</p>\\r\\n<p>They were married in April and his office was ready\\r\\nin May, complete with a staff of eighty. The publicity\\r\\nreleases had gone out, and the Public Relations Lobby\\r\\nthat handled news and education was paid to begin the<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_19\">[Pg 19]</a></span>\\r\\ngreatest build-up any young genius ever had.</p>\\r\\n<p>They celebrated that, with a little party of some four\\r\\nhundred people and reporters at Ryan\\'s lodge in Canada.\\r\\nIt was to be a gala weekend.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was then that Baxter shot himself.</p>\\r\\n<p>Baxter had been Feldman\\'s closest friend in the Lobby.\\r\\nHe\\'d come along to handle press relations and had gotten\\r\\nromantic about the countryside, never having been\\r\\nout of a city before. He hired a guide and went hunting,\\r\\neighty miles beyond the last outpost of civilization.\\r\\nSomehow, he got his hand on a gun, though only guides\\r\\nwere supposed to touch them, managed to overcome its\\r\\nsafety devices, and then pulled the trigger with the gun\\r\\npointed the wrong way.</p>\\r\\n<p>Chris, Feldman and Harnett from Public Relations\\r\\nhad accompanied him on the trip. They were sitting in\\r\\na nearby car while Feldman enjoyed the scenery, Chris\\r\\nmade further plans, and Harnett gathered material.\\r\\nThere was also a photographer and writer, but they\\r\\nhadn\\'t been introduced by name.</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman reached Baxter first. The man was moaning\\r\\nand scared, and he was bleeding profusely. Only a miracle\\r\\nhad saved him from instant death. The bullet had\\r\\nstruck a rib, been deflected and robbed of some of its\\r\\nenergy, and had barely reached the heart. But it had\\r\\npierced the pericardium, as best Feldman could guess,\\r\\nand it could be fatal at any moment.</p>\\r\\n<p>He\\'d reached for a probe without thinking. Chris\\r\\nknocked his hand aside.</p>\\r\\n<p>She was right, of course. He couldn\\'t operate outside\\r\\na hospital. But they had no phone in the lodge where\\r\\nthe guide lived and no way to summon an ambulance.\\r\\nThey\\'d have to drive Baxter back in the car, which\\r\\nwould almost certainly result in his death.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_20\">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>When Feldman seemed uncertain, Harnett had given\\r\\nhis warning in a low but vehement voice. \"You touch\\r\\nhim, Dan, and I\\'ll spread it in every one of our media.\\r\\nI\\'ll have to. It\\'s the only way to retain public confidence.\\r\\nThere\\'d be a leak, with all the guides and others here,\\r\\nand we can\\'t afford that. I like you\\xe2\\x80\\x94you have color. But\\r\\ntouch that wound and I\\'ll crucify you.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Chris added her own threats. She\\'d spent years making\\r\\nhim the outlet for all her ambitions, denied because\\r\\nwomen were still only second-rate members of Medical\\r\\nLobby. She couldn\\'t let it go now. And she was\\r\\nprobably genuinely shocked.</p>\\r\\n<p>Baxter groaned again and started to bleed more profusely.</p>\\r\\n<p>There wasn\\'t much equipment. Feldman operated with\\r\\na pocketknife sterilized in a bottle of expensive Scotch\\r\\nand only anodyne tablets in place of anesthesia. He got\\r\\nthe bullet out and sewed up the wound with a bit of\\r\\nsurgical thread he\\'d been using to tie up a torn good-luck\\r\\nemblem. The photographer and writer recorded\\r\\nthe whole thing. Chris swore harshly and beat her fists\\r\\nagainst the bole of a tree. But Baxter lived. He recovered\\r\\ncompletely, and was shocked at the heinous thing\\r\\nthat had been done to him.</p>\\r\\n<p>They crucified Feldman.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_21\">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"III\"></a>III</h2>\\r\\n<h3>Spaceman</h3>\\r\\n<p>Most crewmen lived rough, ugly lives\\xe2\\x80\\x94and usually,\\r\\nshort ones. Passengers and officers on the big tubs were\\r\\ngiven the equivalent of gravity in spinning compartments,\\r\\nbut the crews rode \"free\". The lucky crewmen\\r\\nlived through their accidents, got space-stomach now\\r\\nand then, and recovered. Nobody cared about the\\r\\nothers.</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman\\'s ticket was work-stamped for the <i>Navaho</i>,\\r\\nand nobody questioned his identity. He suffered through\\r\\nthe agony of acceleration on the shuttle up to the orbital\\r\\nstation, then was sick as acceleration stopped. But\\r\\nhe was able to control himself enough to follow other\\r\\ncrewmen down a hall of the station toward the <i>Navaho</i>.\\r\\nThe big ships never touched a planet, always docking\\r\\nat the stations.</p>\\r\\n<p>A checker met the crew and reached for their badges.\\r\\nHe barely glanced at them, punched a mark for each\\r\\non his checkoff sheet, and handed them back. \"Deckmen\\r\\nforward, tubemen to the rear,\" he ordered. \"<i>Navaho</i>\\r\\nblasts in fifteen minutes. Hey, you! You\\'re tubes.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman grunted. He should have expected it. Tubemen\\r\\nhad the lowest lot of all the crew. Between the\\r\\nkilling work, the heat of the tubes, and occasional doses\\r\\nof radiation, their lives weren\\'t worth the metal value\\r\\nof their tickets.</p>\\r\\n<p>He began pulling himself clumsily along a shaft, dodg<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_22\">[Pg 22]</a></span>ing\\r\\nfreight the loaders were tossing from hand to hand.\\r\\nA bag hit his head, drawing blood, and another caught\\r\\nhim in the groin.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Watch it, bo,\" a loader yelled at him. \"You dent that\\r\\nbag and they\\'ll brig you. Cantcha see it\\'s got a special\\r\\ncourtesy stripe?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It had a brilliant green stripe, he saw. It also had a\\r\\nname, printed in block letters that shouted their identity\\r\\nbefore he could read the words. <i>Dr. Christina Ryan,\\r\\nSouthport, Mars.</i></p>\\r\\n<p>And he\\'d had to choose this time to leave Earth!</p>\\r\\n<p>Suddenly he was glad he was assigned to the tubes. It\\r\\nwas the one place on the ship where he\\'d be least likely\\r\\nto run into her. As a doctor and a courtesy passenger,\\r\\nshe\\'d have complete run of the ship, but she\\'d hardly\\r\\nbother with the dangerous and unpleasant tube section.</p>\\r\\n<p>He dragged his way back, beginning to sweat with\\r\\nthe effort. The <i>Navaho</i> was an old ship. A lot of the\\r\\nhandholds were missing, and he had to throw himself\\r\\nalong by erratic leaps. He was gaining proficiency, but\\r\\nnot enough to handle himself if the ship blasted off.\\r\\nTime was growing short when he reached the aft bunkroom\\r\\nwhere the other tubemen were waiting.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Ben,\" one husky introduced himself. \"Tube chief.\\r\\nKnow how to work this?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman could see that they were assembling a small\\r\\nstill. He\\'d heard of the phenomenal quantities of beer\\r\\nspacemen drank, and now he realized what really happened\\r\\nto it. Hard liquor was supposed to be forbidden,\\r\\nbut they made their own. \"I can work it,\" he decided.\\r\\n\"I\\'m\\xe2\\x80\\x94uh\\xe2\\x80\\x94Dan.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Okay, Dan.\" Ben glanced at the clock. \"Hit the\\r\\nsacks, boys.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>By the time Feldman could settle into the sacklike<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_23\">[Pg 23]</a></span>\\r\\nhammock, the <i>Navaho</i> began to shake faintly, and\\r\\nweight piled up. It was mild compared to that on the\\r\\nshuttle, since the big ships couldn\\'t take high acceleration.\\r\\nSpace had been conquered for more than a century,\\r\\nbut the ships were still flimsy tubs that took months to\\r\\nreach Mars, using immense amounts of fuel. Only the\\r\\nvaluable plant hormones from Mars made commerce\\r\\npossible at the ridiculously high freight rate.</p>\\r\\n<p>Three hours later he began to find out why spacemen\\r\\ndidn\\'t seem to fear dying or turning pariah. The tube\\r\\nquarters had grown insufferably hot during the long\\r\\nblast, but the main tube-room was blistering as Ben led\\r\\nthe men into it. The chief handed out spacesuits and\\r\\nmotioned for Dan.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Greenhorn, aincha? Okay, I\\'ll take you with me. We\\r\\ngo out in the tubes and pull the lining. I pry up the\\r\\nstuff, you carry it back here and stack it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They sealed off the tube-room, pumped out the air,\\r\\nand went into the steaming, mildly radioactive tubes,\\r\\njust big enough for a man on hands and knees. Beyond\\r\\nthe tube mouth was empty space, waiting for the man\\r\\nwho slipped. Ben began ripping out the eroded blocks\\r\\nwith a special tool. Feldman carried them back and\\r\\nstacked them along with others. A plasma furnace\\r\\nmelted them down into new blocks. The work grew\\r\\nprogressively worse as the distance to the tube-room\\r\\nincreased. The tube mouth yawned closer and closer.\\r\\nThere were no handholds there\\xe2\\x80\\x94only the friction of a\\r\\nman\\'s body in the tube.</p>\\r\\n<p>Life settled into a dull routine of labor, sleep, and the\\r\\nbrief relief of the crude white mule from the still.</p>\\r\\n<p>They were six weeks out and almost finished with\\r\\nthe tube cleaning when Number Two tube blew. Bits\\r\\nof the remaining radioactive fuel must have collected<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_24\">[Pg 24]</a></span>\\r\\nslowly until they reached blow-point. Feldman in Number\\r\\nOne would have gone sailing out into space, but\\r\\nBen reacted at once. As the ship leaped slightly, Feldman\\r\\nbrought up sharply against the chief\\'s braced body.\\r\\nFor a second their fate hung in the balance. Then it was\\r\\nover, and Ben shoved him back, grinning faintly.</p>\\r\\n<p>He jerked his thumb and touched helmets briefly.\\r\\n\"There they go, Dan.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The two men who had been working in Number\\r\\nTwo were charred lumps, drifting out into space.</p>\\r\\n<p>No further comment was made on it, except that\\r\\nthey\\'d have to work harder from now on, since they\\r\\nwere shorthanded.</p>\\r\\n<p>That rest period Feldman came down with a mild\\r\\nattack of space-stomach\\xe2\\x80\\x94which meant no more drinking\\r\\nfor him\\xe2\\x80\\x94and was off work for a day. Then the\\r\\npace picked up. The tubes were cleared and they began\\r\\nlaying the new lining for the landing blasts. There\\r\\nwas no time for thought after that. Mars\\' orbital station\\r\\nlay close when the work was finished.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ben slapped Feldman on the back. \"Ya ain\\'t bad for\\r\\na greenie, Dan. We all get six-day passes on Mars. Hit\\r\\nthe sack now so you won\\'t waste time sleeping then.\\r\\nWe\\'ll hear it when the ship berths.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman didn\\'t hear it, but the others did. He felt\\r\\nBen shaking his shoulder, trying to drag him out of\\r\\nthe sack. \"Grab your junk, Dan.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Ben picked up Feldman\\'s nearly empty bag and\\r\\ntossed it toward him, before his eyes were fully open.\\r\\nHe grabbed for it and missed. He grabbed again, with\\r\\nBen\\'s laughter in his ears. The bag hit the wall and\\r\\nfell open, spilling its contents.</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman began gathering it up, but the chief was no\\r\\nlonger laughing. A big hand grabbed up the space<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_25\">[Pg 25]</a></span>\\r\\nticket suddenly, and there was no friendliness now on\\r\\nBen\\'s face.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Art Billing\\'s card!\" Ben told the other tubemen.\\r\\n\"Five trips I made with Art. He was saving his money,\\r\\ngoing to buy a farm on Mars. Five trips and one more\\r\\nto go before he had enough. Now you show up with\\r\\nhis ticket!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The tubemen moved forward toward Feldman. There\\r\\nwas no indecision. To them, apparently, trial had been\\r\\nheld and sentence passed.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Wait a minute,\" Feldman began. \"Billings died of\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"</p>\\r\\n<p>A fist snaked past his raised hand and connected with\\r\\nhis jaw. He bounced off a wall. A wrench sailed toward\\r\\nhim, glanced off his arm, and ripped at his muscles. Another\\r\\nheavy fist struck.</p>\\r\\n<p>Abruptly, Ben\\'s voice cut through their yells. \"Hold\\r\\nit!\" He shoved through the group, tossing men backwards.\\r\\n\"Stow it! We can take care of him later. Right\\r\\nnow, this is captain\\'s business. You fools want to lose\\r\\nyour leave?\" He indicated two of the others. \"You two\\r\\nbring him along\\xe2\\x80\\x94and keep him quiet!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The two grabbed Feldman\\'s arms and dragged him\\r\\nalong as the chief began pulling his way forward\\r\\nthrough the tubes up towards the control section of the\\r\\nship. Feldman took a quick glance at their faces and\\r\\nmade no effort to resist; they obviously would have enjoyed\\r\\nany chance to subdue him.</p>\\r\\n<p>They were stopped twice by minor officers, then sent\\r\\non. They finally found the captain near the exit lock,\\r\\napparently assisting the passengers to leave. Most of\\r\\nthem went on into the shuttle, but Chris Ryan remained\\r\\nbehind as the captain listened to Ben\\'s report\\r\\nand inspected the false ticket.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_26\">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>Finally the captain turned to Feldman. \"You. What\\'s\\r\\nyour name?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Chris\\' eyes were squarely on Feldman, cold and furious.\\r\\n\"He <i>was</i> Doctor Daniel Feldman, Captain Marker,\"\\r\\nshe stated.</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman stood paralyzed. He\\'d been unwilling to face\\r\\nChris. He wanted to avoid all the past. But the idea\\r\\nthat she would denounce him had never entered his\\r\\nhead. There was no Medical rule involved. She knew\\r\\nthat as a pariah he was forbidden to board a passenger\\r\\nship, of course. But she\\'d been his wife once!</p>\\r\\n<p>Marker bowed slightly to her. \"Thank you, Dr. Ryan.\\r\\nI should take this criminal back to Earth in chains, I\\r\\nsuppose. But he\\'s hardly worth the freightage. You men.\\r\\nWant to take him down to Mars and ground him there?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Ben grinned and touched his forelock. \"Thank you,\\r\\nsir. We\\'d enjoy that.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Good. His pay reverts to the ship\\'s fund. That\\'s all,\\r\\nmen.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman started to protest, but a fist lashed savagely\\r\\nagainst his mouth.</p>\\r\\n<p>He made no other protests as they dragged him into\\r\\nthe crew shuttle that took off for Southport. He avoided\\r\\ntheir eyes and sat hunched over. It was Ben who finally\\r\\nbroke the silence.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What happened to Art\\'s money? He had a pile on\\r\\nhim.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Go to hell!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Give, I said!\" Ben twisted his arm back toward his\\r\\nshoulder, applying increasing pressure.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"A doctor took it for his fee when Billings died of\\r\\nspace-stomach. Damn you, I couldn\\'t help him!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Ben looked at the others. \"Med Lobby fee, eh? All\\r\\nthe market will take. Umm. It could be, maybe.\" He<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_27\">[Pg 27]</a></span>\\r\\nshrugged. \"Okay, reasonable doubt. We won\\'t kill you,\\r\\nbo. Not quite, we won\\'t.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The shuttle landed and Ben handed out the little helmets\\r\\nand aspirators that made life possible in Mars\\'\\r\\nthin air. Outside, the tubemen took turns holding Feldman\\r\\nand beating him while the passengers disembarked\\r\\nfrom their shuttle. As he slumped into unconsciousness,\\r\\nhe had a picture of Chris Ryan\\'s frozen face as she\\r\\nmoved steadily toward the port station.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_28\">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"IV\"></a>IV</h2>\\r\\n<h3>Martian</h3>\\r\\n<p>It was night when Feldman came to, and the temperature\\r\\nwas dropping rapidly. He struggled to sit up\\r\\nthrough a fog of pain. Somewhere in his bag, he should\\r\\nhave an anodyne tablet that would kill any ache. He\\r\\nfinally found the pill and swallowed it, fumbling with\\r\\nthe aspirator lip opening.</p>\\r\\n<p>The aspirator meant life to him now, he suddenly realized.\\r\\nHe twisted to stare at the tiny charge-indicator\\r\\nfor the battery. It showed half-charge. Then he saw that\\r\\nsomeone had attached another battery beside it. He puzzled\\r\\nbriefly over it, but his immediate concern was for\\r\\nshelter.</p>\\r\\n<p>Apparently he was still where he had been knocked\\r\\nout. There was a light coming from the little station,\\r\\nand he headed toward that, fumbling for the few quarters\\r\\nthat represented his entire fortune.</p>\\r\\n<p>Maybe it would have been better if the tubemen had\\r\\nkilled him. Batteries were an absolute necessity here,\\r\\nfood and shelter would be expensive, and he had no\\r\\nskills to earn his way. At most, he had only a day or so\\r\\nleft. But meantime, he had to find warmth before the\\r\\ncold killed him.</p>\\r\\n<p>The tiny restaurant in the station was still open, and\\r\\nthe air was warm inside. He pulled off the aspirator,\\r\\nshutting off the battery.</p>\\r\\n<p>The counterman didn\\'t even glance up as he entered.\\r\\nFeldman gazed at the printed menu and flinched.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_29\">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"Soup,\" he ordered. It was the cheapest item he could\\r\\nfind.</p>\\r\\n<p>The counterman stared at him, obviously spotting his\\r\\nEarth origin. \"You adjusted to synthetics?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman nodded. Earth operated on a mixed diet,\\r\\nwith synthetics for all who couldn\\'t afford the natural\\r\\nfoods there. But Mars was all synthetic. Many of the\\r\\nchemicals in food could exist in either of two forms, or\\r\\nisomers; they were chemically alike, but differently crystallized.\\r\\nSometimes either form was digestible, but frequently\\r\\nthe body could use only the isomer to which it\\r\\nwas adjusted.</p>\\r\\n<p>Martian plants produced different isomers from those\\r\\non Earth. Since the synthetic foods turned out to be\\r\\nMars-normal, that was probably the more natural form.\\r\\nResearch designed to let the early colonists live off native\\r\\nfood here had turned up an enzyme that enabled\\r\\nthe body to handle either isomer. In a few weeks of eating\\r\\nMartian or synthetic food, the body adapted; without\\r\\nmore enzyme, it lost its power to handle Earth-normal\\r\\nfood.</p>\\r\\n<p>The cheapness of <ins class=\"correction\" title=\"Transcriber\\'s Note: Original had \\'snythetics\\'.\">synthetics</ins> and the discovery that\\r\\nmany diseases common to Earth would not attack Mars-normal\\r\\nbodies led to the wide use of synthetics on\\r\\nEarth. No pariah could have been expected to afford\\r\\nEarth-normal.</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman finished the soup, and found a cigarette\\r\\nthat was smokable. \"Any objections if I sit in the waiting\\r\\nroom?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He\\'d expected a rejection, but the counterman only\\r\\nshrugged. The waiting room was almost dark and the\\r\\nair was chilly, but there was normal pressure. He found\\r\\na bench and slumped onto it, lighting his cigarette.\\r\\nHe\\'d miss the smokes\\xe2\\x80\\x94but probably not for long. He<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_30\">[Pg 30]</a></span>\\r\\nfinished the cigarette reluctantly and sat huddled on the\\r\\nbench, waiting for morning.</p>\\r\\n<p>The airlock opened later, and feet sounded on the\\r\\nboards of the waiting-room floor, but he didn\\'t look up\\r\\nuntil a thin beam of light hit him. Then he sighed and\\r\\nnodded. The shoes, made of some odd fiber, didn\\'t look\\r\\nlike those of a cop, but this was Mars. He could see\\r\\nonly a hulking shadow behind the light.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You the man who was a medical doctor?\" The voice\\r\\nwas dry and old.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yeah,\" Feldman answered. \"Once.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Good. Thought that space crewman was just lying\\r\\ndrunk at first. Come along, Doc.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Why?\" It didn\\'t matter, but if they wanted him to\\r\\nmove on, they\\'d have to push a little harder.</p>\\r\\n<p>The light swung up to show the other. He was the\\r\\nshade of old leather with a bleached patch of sandy hair\\r\\nand the deepest gray eyes Feldman had ever seen. It\\r\\nwas a face that could have belonged to a country storekeeper\\r\\nin New England, with the same hint of dry humor.\\r\\nThe man was dressed in padded levis and a leather\\r\\njacket of unguessable age. His aspirator seemed worn\\r\\nand patched, and one big hand fumbled with it.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Because we\\'re friends, Doc,\" the voice drawled at\\r\\nhim. \"Because you might as well come with us as sit\\r\\nhere. Maybe we have a job for you.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman shrugged and stood up. If the man was a\\r\\nLobby policeman, he was different from the usual kind.\\r\\nNothing could be worse than the present prospects.</p>\\r\\n<p>They went out through the doors of the waiting room\\r\\ntoward a rattletrap vehicle. It looked something like a\\r\\ncross between a schoolboy\\'s jalopy and a scaled-down\\r\\narmy tank of former times. The treads were caterpillar\\r\\nstyle, and the stubby body was completely enclosed. A<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_31\">[Pg 31]</a></span>\\r\\ntiny airlock stuck out from the rear.</p>\\r\\n<p>Two men were inside, both bearded. The old man\\r\\ngrinned at them. \"Mark, Lou, meet Doc Feldman. Sit,\\r\\nDoc. I\\'m Jake Mullens, and you might say we were\\r\\nfarmers.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The motor started with a wheeze. The tractor swung\\r\\nabout and began heading away from Southport toward\\r\\nthe desert dunes. It shook and rattled, but it seemed to\\r\\nmake good time.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I don\\'t know anything about farming,\" Feldman protested.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake shrugged. \"No, of course not. Couple of our\\r\\nfriends heard about you where a spaceman was getting\\r\\ndrunk and tipped us off. We know who you are. Here,\\r\\ntry a bracky?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman took what seemed to be a cigarette and\\r\\nstudied it doubtfully. It was coarse and fibrous inside,\\r\\nwith a thin, hard shell that seemed to be a natural\\r\\ngrowth, as if it had been chopped from some vine. He\\r\\nlighted it, not knowing what to expect. Then he\\r\\ncoughed as the bitter, rancid smoke burned at his throat.\\r\\nHe started to throw it down, and hesitated. Jake was\\r\\nsmoking one, and it had killed the craving for tobacco\\r\\nalmost instantly.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Some like \\'em, most don\\'t,\" Jake said. \"They won\\'t\\r\\nhurt you. Look\\xe2\\x80\\x94see that? Old Martian ruins. Built by\\r\\nsome race a million years ago. Only half a dozen on\\r\\nMars.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It was only a clump of weathered stone buildings in\\r\\nthe light from the tractor, and Feldman had seen better\\r\\nin the stereo shots. It was interesting only because it\\r\\nconnected with the legendary Martian race, like the canals\\r\\nthat showed from space but could not be seen on\\r\\nthe surface of the planet.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_32\">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman waited for the other to go on, but Jake was\\r\\nsilent. Finally, he ground out the butt of the weed.\\r\\n\"Okay, Jake. What do you want with me?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Consultation, maybe. Ever hear of herb doctors? I\\'m\\r\\none of them.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman knew that the Lobby permitted some leniency\\r\\nhere, due to the scarcity of real medical help.\\r\\nThere was only one decent hospital at Northport, on\\r\\nthe opposite side of the planet.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake sighed and reached for another bracky weed.\\r\\n\"Yeah, I\\'m pretty good with herbs. But I got a sick\\r\\nvillage on my hands and I can\\'t handle it. We can\\'t all\\r\\nmortgage our work to pay for a trip to Northport.\\r\\nSouthport\\'s all messed up while the new she-doctor gets\\r\\nher metabolism changed. Maybe the old guy there\\r\\nwould have helped, but he died a couple months ago.\\r\\nSo it looks like you\\'re our only hope.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Then you have no hope,\" Feldman told him sickly.\\r\\n\"I\\'m a pariah, Jake. I can\\'t do a thing for you.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We heard about your argument with the Lobby.\\r\\nNews reaches Mars. But these are mighty sick people,\\r\\nDoc.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman shook his head. \"Better take me back. I\\'m\\r\\nnot allowed to practice medicine. The charge would be\\r\\nfirst-degree murder if anything happened.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Lou leaned forward. \"Shall I talk to him, Jake?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The old man grimaced. \"Time enough. Let him see\\r\\nwhat we got first.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Sand howled against the windshield and the tractor\\r\\nbumped and surged along. Feldman took another of the\\r\\nweeds and tried to estimate their course. But he had no\\r\\nidea where they were when the tractor finally stopped.\\r\\nThere was a village of small huts that seemed to be\\r\\nmerely entrances to living quarters dug under the sur<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_33\">[Pg 33]</a></span>face.\\r\\nThey led him into one and through a tunnel into\\r\\na large room filled with simple cots and the unhappy\\r\\nsounds of sick people.</p>\\r\\n<p>Two women were disconsolately trying to attend to\\r\\nthe half-dozen sick\\xe2\\x80\\x94four children and two adults. Their\\r\\nfaces brightened as they saw Jake, then fell. \"Eb and\\r\\nTilda died,\" they reported.</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman looked at the two figures under the sheets\\r\\nand whistled. The same black specks he had seen on the\\r\\nface of Billings covered the skins of the two old people\\r\\nwho had died.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Funny,\" Jake said slowly. \"They didn\\'t quite act like\\r\\nthe others and they sure died mighty fast. Darn it, I\\r\\nhad it figured for that stuff in the book. Infantile paralysis.\\r\\nHow about it, Doc? Sort of like a cold, stiff\\r\\nsore neck.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It was clearly polio\\xe2\\x80\\x94one of the diseases that could attack\\r\\nMars-normal flesh. Feldman nodded at the symptoms,\\r\\nstaring at the sick kids. He shrugged, finally.\\r\\n\"There\\'s a cure for it, but I don\\'t have the serum. Neither\\r\\ndo you, or you wouldn\\'t have brought me here. I\\r\\ncouldn\\'t help if I wanted to.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"That old book didn\\'t list a cure,\" Jake told him.\\r\\n\"But it said the kids didn\\'t have to be crippled. There\\r\\nwas something about a Kenny treatment. Doc, does the\\r\\nstuff really cripple for life?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman saw one of the boys flinch. He dropped his\\r\\neyes, remembering the Lobby\\'s efficient spy service on\\r\\nEarth and wondering what it was like here. But he knew\\r\\nthe outcome.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Damn you, Jake!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake chuckled. \"Thought you would. We sure appreciate\\r\\nit. Just tell us what to do, Doc.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman began writing down his requirements, try<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_34\">[Pg 34]</a></span>ing\\r\\nto remember the details of the treatment. Exercise,\\r\\nhot compresses, massage. It was coming back to him.\\r\\nHe\\'d have to do it himself, of course, to get the feel\\r\\nof it. He couldn\\'t explain it well enough. But he couldn\\'t\\r\\nturn his back on the kids, either.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Maybe I can help,\" he said doubtfully as he moved\\r\\ntoward a cot.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No, Doc.\" Jake\\'s voice wasn\\'t amused any longer,\\r\\nand he held the younger man back. \"You\\'re doing us a\\r\\nfavor, and I\\'ll be darned if I\\'ll let you stick your neck\\r\\nout too far. You can\\'t treat \\'em yourself. Mars is\\r\\ntougher than Earth. You should live under Space Lobby\\r\\n<i>and</i> Medical Lobby here a while. Oh, maybe they\\r\\ndon\\'t mind a few fools like me being herb doctors, but\\r\\nthey\\'d sure hate to have a man who can do real medicine\\r\\noutside their hands. You let me do it, or get in\\r\\nthe tractor and I\\'ll have Lou drive you back. Once you\\r\\nstart in here, there\\'ll be no stopping. Believe me.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman looked at him, seeing the colonials around\\r\\nhim for the first time as people. It had been a long time\\r\\nsince he\\'d been treated as a fellow human by anyone.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake was right, he knew. Once he put his hand to the\\r\\nbandage, eventually there\\'d be no turning back from\\r\\nthe scalpel. These people needed medical help too desperately.\\r\\nEventually, the news would spread, and the\\r\\nLobby police would come for him. Chris couldn\\'t afford\\r\\nto shield him. In fact, he was sure now that she\\'d\\r\\nhunt him night and day.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Don\\'t be a fool, Jake,\" he ordered brusquely. He\\r\\nhanded his list to one of the women. \"You\\'ll have to\\r\\nlearn to do what I do,\" he told the people there. \"You\\'ll\\r\\nhave to work like fools for weeks. But there won\\'t be\\r\\nmany crippled children. I can promise that much!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He blinked sharply at the sudden hope in their eyes.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_35\">[Pg 35]</a></span>\\r\\nBut his mind went on wondering how long it would\\r\\nbe before the inevitable would catch up with him. With\\r\\nluck, maybe a few months. But he hadn\\'t been blessed\\r\\nwith any superabundance of luck. It would probably be\\r\\nless time than he thought.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_36\">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"V\"></a>V</h2>\\r\\n<h3>Surgery</h3>\\r\\n<p>Doc Feldman\\'s luck was better than he had expected.\\r\\nFor an Earth year, he was a doctor again, moving about\\r\\nfrom village to village as he was needed and doing what\\r\\nhe could.</p>\\r\\n<p>The village had been isolated during the early colonization\\r\\nwhen Mars made a feeble attempt to break free\\r\\nof Space Lobby. Their supplies had been cut off and\\r\\nthey had been forced to do for themselves. Now they\\r\\nwere largely self-sufficient. They grew native plants and\\r\\nextracted hormones in crude little chemical plants. The\\r\\nhormones were traded to the big chemical plants for a\\r\\npittance to buy what had to come from Earth. Other\\r\\njury-rigged affairs synthesized much of their food. But\\r\\nmostly they learned to get along on what Mars provided.</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc Feldman learned from them. Money was no\\r\\nlonger part of his life. He ate with whatever family\\r\\nneeded him and slipped into the life around him.</p>\\r\\n<p>He was learning Martian medicine and finding that\\r\\nhis Earth courses were mostly useless. No wonder the\\r\\nvillagers distrusted Lobby doctors. Doc had his own little\\r\\nlaboratory where he had managed to start making\\r\\nMars-normal penicillin\\xe2\\x80\\x94a primitive antibiotic, but better\\r\\nthan nothing.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake had come to remind him that it was his first anniversary,\\r\\nand now they were smoking bracky together.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_37\">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"Sheer luck, Jake,\" Doc repeated. \"You Martians are\\r\\ntough. But some day someone is going to die under my\\r\\ncare, with the little equipment I have. Then\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake nodded slowly. \"Maybe, Doc. And maybe some\\r\\nday Mars will break free of the Lobbies. You\\'d better\\r\\npray for that.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I\\'ve been\\xe2\\x80\\x94\" Doc stopped, realizing what he\\'d\\r\\nstarted to say. The old man chuckled.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You\\'ve been talking rebellion for months, Doc. I\\r\\nhear rumors. Whenever you get mad, you want us to\\r\\nsecede. But you don\\'t really mean it yet. You can\\'t picture\\r\\nany government but the one you\\'re used to.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc grinned. Jake had a point, but it was not as\\r\\nstrong as it would have been a few months before. The\\r\\ntowns under the Lobby were cheap imitations of Earth,\\r\\nbut here, divorced to a large extent from the lobbies,\\r\\nthe villages were making Mars their own. Their ways\\r\\nmight be strange; but they worked.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake shifted his body in the weak sunlight. \"Newton\\r\\nvillage forgot to report a death on time. I hear Ryan\\r\\nis sweating them out, trying to prove it was your fault.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>There was no evidence against him yet, Doc was sure.\\r\\nBut Chris was out to prove something, and to get a\\r\\nreputation as a top-flight administrator. It must have\\r\\nhurt when they shipped her here as head of the lesser\\r\\nhemisphere of Mars. She\\'d expected to use Feldman as\\r\\na front while she became the actual ruler of the whole\\r\\nLobby. Now she wanted to strike back.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"She\\'s using blackmail,\" he said, and some of his old\\r\\nbitterness was in his voice. \"Anyone taking treatment\\r\\nfrom an herb doctor in this section is cut off from Medical\\r\\nLobby service. Damn it, Jake, that could mean letting\\r\\npeople die!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yeah.\" Jake sighed softly. \"It could mean letting<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_38\">[Pg 38]</a></span>\\r\\npeople begin to think about getting rid of the Lobby,\\r\\ntoo. Well, I gotta help harvest the bracky. Take it easy\\r\\non operating for a while, will you, Doc?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"All right, Jake. But stop keeping the serious cases a\\r\\nsecret. Two men died last month because you wouldn\\'t\\r\\ncall me for surgery. I\\'ve broken all my oaths already.\\r\\nIt doesn\\'t matter anymore.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It matters, boy. We\\'ve been lucky, but some day one\\r\\ncase will go to the hospital and they\\'ll find your former\\r\\nwork. Then they\\'ll really be after you. The less you do\\r\\nthe better.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc watched Jake slump off, then turned down into\\r\\nthe little root cellar and back toward the room concealed\\r\\nbehind it, where his crude laboratory lay. For\\r\\nthe moment, he was free to work on the mystery of the\\r\\nblack spots.</p>\\r\\n<p>He kept running into them\\xe2\\x80\\x94always on the body of\\r\\nsomeone who died of something that seemed like a normal\\r\\ndisease. Without a microscope, he was almost helpless,\\r\\nbut he had taken specimens and tried to culture\\r\\nthem. Some of his cultures had grown, though they\\r\\nmight be nothing but unknown Martian fungi or bacteria.\\r\\nMars was dry and almost devoid of air, but plants\\r\\nand a few smaller insects had survived and adapted. It\\r\\nwasn\\'t by any means lifeless.</p>\\r\\n<p>Without a microscope, he could do little but depend\\r\\non his files of cases. But today there was new evidence.\\r\\nA villager had filched an Earth <i>Medical Journal</i> from\\r\\nthe tractor driven by Chris Ryan and forwarded it to\\r\\nhim. He found the black specks mentioned in a single\\r\\nparagraph, under skin diseases. Investigation of the diet\\r\\nwas being made, since all cases were among people\\r\\neating synthetics.</p>\\r\\n<p>There was another article on aberrant cases\\xe2\\x80\\x94a few<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_39\">[Pg 39]</a></span>\\r\\nstrange little misbehaviors in classical syndromes. He\\r\\nstudied that, wondering. It had to be the same thing.\\r\\nDiet didn\\'t account for the fact that the specks appeared\\r\\nonly when the patient was near death.</p>\\r\\n<p>Nor did it account for the hard lump at the base of\\r\\nthe neck which he found in every case he could check.\\r\\nThat might be coincidence, but he doubted it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Whatever it was, it aggravated any other disease the\\r\\npatient had and made seemingly simple diseases turn out\\r\\nto be completely and rapidly fatal. Once syphilis had\\r\\nbeen called \"The Great Imitator\". This gave promise of\\r\\nbeing worse.</p>\\r\\n<p>He shook his head, cursing his lack of equipment.\\r\\nEach month more people were dying with these specks\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\r\\nhe was helpless.</p>\\r\\n<p>The concealed door broke open suddenly and a boy\\r\\nthrust his head in. \"Doc, there\\'s a man here from Einstein.\\r\\nSays his wife\\'s dying.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The man was already coming into the room.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"She\\'s powerful sick, Doc. Had a bellyache, fever,\\r\\nbegan throwing up. Pains under her belly, like she\\'s\\r\\nhad before. But this time it\\'s awful.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc shot a few questions at him, frowning at what\\r\\nhe heard. Then he began packing the few things that\\r\\nmight help. There should be no appendicitis on Mars.\\r\\nThe bugs responsible for that shouldn\\'t have adapted\\r\\nto Mars-normal. But more and more infections found\\r\\nways to cross the border. Gangrene had been able to get\\r\\nby without change, it seemed. So far, none of the contagious\\r\\ninfections except polio and the common cold\\r\\nhad made the jump.</p>\\r\\n<p>This sounded like an advanced case, perhaps already\\r\\ninvolving peritonitis.</p>\\r\\n<p>So far, he\\'d been lucky with penicillin, but each time<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_40\">[Pg 40]</a></span>\\r\\nhe used it with grave doubts of its action on the Mars-adapted\\r\\npatients. If the appendix had burst, however, it\\r\\nwas the only possible treatment.</p>\\r\\n<p>He riffled through his stores; There was ether enough,\\r\\nfortunately. The villagers had made that for him out of\\r\\nMartian plants, using their complicated fermentation\\r\\nprocesses. He yelled for Jake, and the boy brought the\\r\\nold man back a moment later.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Jake, I\\'ll need more of that narcotic stuff. I don\\'t\\r\\nwant the woman writhing and tearing her stitches after\\r\\nthe ether wears off.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Can\\'t get it, Doc.\" Jake\\'s eyes seemed to cloud as he\\r\\nsaid it. \"Distilling plant broke down. Doc, I don\\'t like\\r\\nthis case. That woman\\'s been to the hospital three times.\\r\\nI hear she just got out recently. This might be a plant,\\r\\nor they figure they can\\'t help her.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"They\\'re afraid to try anything on Mars-normal flesh.\\r\\nThey can\\'t be proved wrong if they do nothing.\" Doc\\r\\nfinished packing his bag and got ready to go out. \"Jake,\\r\\neither I\\'m a doctor or I\\'m not. I can\\'t worry when a\\r\\nwoman may be dying.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>For a second, Jake\\'s expression was stubborn. Then\\r\\nthe little crow\\'s feet around his eyes deepened and the\\r\\ndry chuckle was back in his voice. \"Right, Dr. Feldman.\"\\r\\nHe flipped up his thumb and went off at a shuffling\\r\\nrun toward the tractor. Lou and the man from\\r\\nEinstein followed Doc into the machine.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was a silent ride, except for Doc\\'s questions about\\r\\nthe sick woman. Her husband, George Lynn, was evasive\\r\\nand probably ignorant. He admitted that Harriet\\r\\nhad been to the dispensary and small infirmary that\\r\\nSouthport called a hospital.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was the only place in the entire Southern hemisphere\\r\\nwhere an operation could be performed legally.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_41\">[Pg 41]</a></span>\\r\\nMost cases had to go to Northport, but Chris had been\\r\\ntrying to expand. Apparently, she was determined to\\r\\nmake Southport into another major center before she\\r\\nwas called back to Earth.</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc wondered why the villagers went there. They\\r\\nhad no medical insurance with the Lobby; they couldn\\'t\\r\\nafford it. Most villagers didn\\'t have the cash, either.\\r\\nThey were forced to mortgage their future work and\\r\\nthat of their families to the drug plants that were run\\r\\nby the Lobby.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And they just turned your wife away?\" Doc asked.\\r\\nHe couldn\\'t quite believe that of Chris.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Well, I dunno. She wouldn\\'t talk much. Twice she\\r\\nwent and they gave her something. Cost every cent I\\r\\ncould borrow. Then this last time, they kept her a couple\\r\\ndays before they let me come and get her. But\\r\\nnow she\\'s a lot worse.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake spun about, suddenly tense. \"How\\'d you pay\\r\\nthem last time, George?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Why, they didn\\'t ask. I told her she could put up\\r\\nsix months from me and the kids, but nobody said nothing\\r\\nabout it. Just gave her back to me.\" He frowned\\r\\nslowly, his dull voice uncertain. \"They told me they\\'d\\r\\ndone all they could, not to bring her back. That\\'s why\\r\\nshe was so strong on getting Doc.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I don\\'t like it,\" Jake said flatly. \"It stinks. They always\\r\\ncharge. George, did they suggest she get in touch\\r\\nwith Doc here?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Maybe they did, maybe not. Harriet did all the talking\\r\\nwith them. I just do what she tells me, and she said\\r\\nto get Doc.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake swore. \"It smells like a trap. Are you sure she\\'s\\r\\nsick, George?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I felt her head and she sure had a fever.\" George<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_42\">[Pg 42]</a></span>\\r\\nLynn was torn between his loyalties. \"You know me,\\r\\nDoc. You fixed me up that time I had the red pip. I\\r\\nwouldn\\'t pull nothing on you.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc had a feeling that Jake was probably right, but\\r\\nhe vetoed the suggestion that they stop to look for spies.\\r\\nHe had no time for that. If the woman was really sick,\\r\\nhe had to get to her at once, and even that might be\\r\\ntoo late.</p>\\r\\n<p>He remembered the woman, sickly from other treatment.\\r\\nHe\\'d been forced to remove her inflamed tonsils\\r\\na few months before. She\\'d whined and complained because\\r\\nhe couldn\\'t spend all his time attending her. She\\r\\nwas a nag, a shrew, and a totally selfish woman. But that\\r\\nwas her <ins class=\"correction\" title=\"Transcriber\\'s Note: Original had \\'huband\\'s\\'.\">husband\\'s</ins> worry, not his.</p>\\r\\n<p>He dashed into the little house when they reached\\r\\nEinstein, and his first glance confirmed what George\\r\\nLynn had said. The woman was sick, all right. She was\\r\\nrunning a high fever. Much too high.</p>\\r\\n<p>She began whining and protesting at his having taken\\r\\nso long, but the pain soon forced her to stop.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"There may still be a chance,\" Doc told her husband\\r\\nbrusquely. He threw the cleanest sheet onto a table and\\r\\nshoved it under the single light. \"Keep out of the way\\xe2\\x80\\x94in\\r\\nthe other room, if you can all pile in there. This\\r\\nisn\\'t exactly aseptic, anyhow. You can boil a lot of water,\\r\\nif you want to help.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It would give them something to do and he could\\r\\nuse the water to clean up. There was no time to wait\\r\\nfor it, however. He had to sterilize with alcohol and\\r\\ncarbolic acid, and hope. He bent over the woman, ripping\\r\\nher thin gown across to make room for the operation.</p>\\r\\n<p>Then he swore.</p>\\r\\n<p>Across her abdomen was the unhealed wound of a<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_43\">[Pg 43]</a></span>\\r\\nprevious operation. They\\'d worked on her at <ins class=\"correction\" title=\"Transcriber\\'s Note: Original had \\'Southpost\\'.\">Southport</ins>.\\r\\nThey must have removed the appendix and then\\r\\nbeen shocked by the signs of infection. They weren\\'t\\r\\nsupposed to release a sick patient, but there was an easy\\r\\nout for them; they could remove her from the danger\\r\\nof spreading an unknown infection. Some doctors must\\r\\nhave doped her up on sedatives and painkillers and sent\\r\\nher home, knowing that she would call him.\\r\\nFor that matter, they might have noticed her unrecorded\\r\\ntonsillectomy and considered her fair bait.</p>\\r\\n<p>He grabbed the ether and slapped a cone over her\\r\\nnose. She tried to protest; she never cooperated in anything.\\r\\nBut the fumes of the ether he dipped onto the\\r\\npacking of the cone soon overcame that.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was peritonitis, of course. The only thing to do was\\r\\nto go in and scrape and clean as best he could. It was\\r\\na rotten job to have to do, and he should have had\\r\\nhelp. But he gritted his teeth and began. He couldn\\'t\\r\\ntrust anyone else to hold the instruments, even.</p>\\r\\n<p>He cleaned the infection as best he could, knowing\\r\\nthere was almost no chance. He used all the penicillin\\r\\nhe dared. Then he began sewing up the incision. It\\r\\nwas all he could do, except for dressing the wound with\\r\\na sterile bandage. He reached for one, and stopped.</p>\\r\\n<p>While he\\'d been working, the woman had died, far\\r\\nmore quietly than she had ever lived.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was probably the only gracious act of her life.\\r\\nBut it was damning to Doc. They couldn\\'t hide her\\r\\ndeath, and any investigation would show that someone\\r\\nhad worked on her. To the Lobby, he would be the\\r\\none who had murdered her.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake was waiting in the tractor. He took one look at\\r\\nDoc\\'s face and made no inquiries.</p>\\r\\n<p>They were more than a mile away when Jake pointed<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_44\">[Pg 44]</a></span>\\r\\nback. Small in the distance, but distinct against the\\r\\nsands, a gray Medical Corps tractor was coming. Either\\r\\nthey\\'d had a spy in the village or they\\'d guessed the\\r\\nrate of her infection very closely. They must have\\r\\nhoped to catch Doc in the act, and they\\'d barely\\r\\nmissed.</p>\\r\\n<p>It wouldn\\'t matter. Their pictures and what testimony\\r\\nthey could force from the village should be\\r\\nenough to hang Doc.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_45\">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"VI\"></a>VI</h2>\\r\\n<h3>Research</h3>\\r\\n<p>There had been a council the night following the\\r\\ndeath of Harriet Lynn. Somehow the word had spread\\r\\nthrough the villages and the chiefs had assembled in\\r\\nJake\\'s village. But they had brought no solution, and\\r\\nin the long run had been forced to accept Doc\\'s decision.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I\\'m not going to retire and hide,\" he\\'d told them,\\r\\nsurprised at his own decision, but grimly determined.\\r\\n\"You need me and I need you. I\\'ll move every\\r\\nday in hopes the Lobby police won\\'t find me, but I\\r\\nwon\\'t quit.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Now he was packing the things he most needed and\\r\\ngetting ready to move. The small bottles in which he\\r\\nwas trying to grow his cultures would need warmth.\\r\\nHe shoved them into an inner pocket, and began surveying\\r\\nwhat must be left.</p>\\r\\n<p>He was heading for his tractor when another battered\\r\\nmachine drove up. It had a girl of about fourteen, with\\r\\ntears streaming down her face. She held out a pleading\\r\\nhand, and her voice was scared. \"It\\'s\\xe2\\x80\\x94it\\'s mama!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Where?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Leibnitz.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Leibnitz was near enough. Doc started his tractor,\\r\\nmotioning for the girl to lead the way. The little dwelling\\r\\nshe led him to was at the edge of the village, looking\\r\\nmore poverty-stricken than most.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_46\">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>Chris Ryan, and three of the Medical Lobby police\\r\\nwere inside, waiting. The girl\\'s mother was tied to the\\r\\nbed, with a collection of medical instruments laid\\r\\nout, but apparently the threat had been enough. No\\r\\nactual injury had been inflicted. Probably none had\\r\\nbeen intended seriously.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I knew you\\'d answer that kind of call,\" Chris said\\r\\ncoldly.</p>\\r\\n<p>He grinned sickly. They\\'d wasted no time. \"I hear\\r\\nit\\'s more than you\\'ll do, Chris. Congratulations! My patient\\r\\ndied. You\\'re lucky.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"She was certainly dead when my men took her picture.\\r\\nThe print shows the death grimace clearly.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Pretty. Frame it and keep it to comfort you when\\r\\nyou feel lonely,\" he snapped.</p>\\r\\n<p>She struck him across the mouth with the handle of\\r\\nher gun. Then she twisted out through the door\\r\\nquickly, heading for the tractor that had been camouflaged\\r\\nto look like those used by the villagers. The three\\r\\npolice led him behind her.</p>\\r\\n<p>A shout went up, and people began to rush onto the\\r\\nvillage street. But they were too late. By the time they\\r\\nreached Southport, Doc could see a trail of battered\\r\\ntractors behind, but there was nothing more the people\\r\\ncould do.

But this involves\\r\\nEarth Medical Lobby. I demand\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Tch, <i>tch</i>!\" The judge stared at her reprovingly.\\r\\n\"Young woman, you don\\'t demand anything. This is\\r\\nMars. If Space Lobby can stand me, I guess our friends\\r\\nover at Medical will have to. Or should I hold trial\\r\\nright now and find Feldman innocent for lack of evidence?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You wouldn\\'t!\" Chris cried. Then her face sobered\\r\\nsuddenly. \"I apologize. Medical is pleased to leave\\r\\nthings in your hands, of course.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Wilson smiled. \"Court\\'s closed for today. Doc, I\\'ll\\r\\nshow you your cell. It\\'s right next to my study, so I\\'m\\r\\nheading there anyhow.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He began shucking his robe while Chris went out\\r\\nwith the police, her voice sharp and continual.</p>\\r\\n<p>The cell was both reasonably escape-proof and comfortable,\\r\\nDoc saw, and he tried to thank the judge.</p>\\r\\n<p>But the old man waved it aside. \"Forget it. I just like\\r\\nto see that little termagant taken down. But don\\'t count\\r\\non my being soft. My methods may be a bit unusual\\xe2\\x80\\x94I\\r\\nalways did like the courtroom scenes in the old\\r\\nbooks by that fellow Smith\\xe2\\x80\\x94but Space Lobby never<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_48\">[Pg 48]</a></span>\\r\\nhad any reason to reverse my decisions. Anything you\\r\\nneed?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Sure,\" Doc told him, grinning in spite of his bitterness.\\r\\n\"A good biology lab and an electron microscope.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Umm. How about a good optical mike and some\\r\\nstains? Just got them in on the last shipment. Figure\\r\\nthey were meant for you anyhow, since Jake Mullens\\r\\nasked me to order them.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He went out and came back with the box almost at\\r\\nonce. He snorted at Doc\\'s incredulous thanks and\\r\\nmoved off, his bedroom slippers slapping against the\\r\\nhard floor.</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc stared after him. If he were a friend of Jake,\\r\\nwilling to invent some excuse to get a microscope here\\r\\n... but it didn\\'t matter. Friend or foe, his death sentence\\r\\nwould be equally fatal. And there were other\\r\\nthings to be thought of now. The little microscope was\\r\\nan excellent one, though only a monocular.</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc\\'s hands trembled as he drew his cultures out and\\r\\nbegan making up a slide. The sun offered the best\\r\\nsource of light near the window, and he adjusted the\\r\\ninstrument. Something began to come into view, but\\r\\ntoo faintly to be really visible.</p>\\r\\n<p>He remembered the stains, trying to recall his biology\\r\\ncourses. More by luck than skill, his fourth try gave him\\r\\nresults.</p>\\r\\n<p>Under two thousand powers, he could just see details.\\r\\nThere were dozens of cells in his impure culture,\\r\\nbut only one seemed unfamiliar. It was a long, worm-like\\r\\nthing, sharpened at both ends, with the three separate\\r\\nnuclei that were typical of Martian life forms.\\r\\nNearby were a host of little rodlike squiggles just too\\r\\nsmall to see clearly.</p>\\r\\n<p>Martian life! No Martian bug had ever proved harm<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_49\">[Pg 49]</a></span>ful\\r\\nto men. Yet this was no mutated cell or virus from\\r\\nEarth; it was a new disease, completely different from\\r\\nall others. It was one where all Earth\\'s centuries of experience\\r\\nwith bacteria would be valueless\\xe2\\x80\\x94the first\\r\\nMartian disease. Unless this was simply some accidental\\r\\ncontamination of his culture, not common to the other\\r\\nsamples. He worked on until the light was too faint\\r\\nbefore putting the microscope aside.</p>\\r\\n<p>By the time the trial commenced, however, he was\\r\\nsure of the cause of the disease. It <i>was</i> Martian. Crude\\r\\nas his cultures were, they had proved that.</p>\\r\\n<p>The little courtroom was filled, mostly from the villages.\\r\\nLou was there, along with others he had come to\\r\\nknow. Then the sight of Jake caught Doc\\'s eyes. The\\r\\ndarned fool had no business there; he could get too\\r\\nclosely mixed into the whole mess.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Court\\'s in session,\" Wilson announced. \"Doc, you\\r\\nrepresented by counsel?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake\\'s voice answered. \"Your Honor, I represent the\\r\\ndefendant. I think you\\'ll find my credentials in order.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Chris started to protest, but Wilson grinned. \"Never\\r\\nlost your standing in spite of that little fracas thirty\\r\\nyears ago, so far as I know. But the police thought you\\r\\nwere a witness when you came walking in. Figured you\\r\\nwere giving up.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I never said so,\" Jake answered.</p>\\r\\n<p>Chris was squirming angrily, but the florid man acting\\r\\nas counsel for Medical Lobby shook his head, bending\\r\\nover to whisper in her ear. He straightened. \"No objection\\r\\nto counsel for the defense. We recognize his\\r\\ncredentials.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You\\'re a fool, Matthews,\" the judge told him. \"Jake\\r\\nwas smarter than half the rest of Legal Lobby before\\r\\nhe went native. Still can tie your tail <ins class=\"correction\" title=\"Transcriber\\'s Note: Original had \\'in\\'.\">to</ins> a can. Okay,<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_50\">[Pg 50]</a></span>\\r\\nlet\\'s start things. I\\'m too old to dawdle.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc lost track of most of what happened. This was\\r\\ntotally unlike anything on Earth, though it might have\\r\\nbeen in keeping with the general casualness of the villages.\\r\\nMaybe the ritualistic routine of the Lobbies was\\r\\ndriving those who could resist to the opposite extreme.</p>\\r\\n<p>Chris was the final witness. Matthews drew comment\\r\\nof Feldman\\'s former crime from her, and Jake made\\r\\nno protest, though Wilson seemed to expect one. Then\\r\\nshe began sewing his shroud. There wasn\\'t a fact that\\r\\nmanaged to emerge without slanting, though technically\\r\\ncorrect. Jake sat quietly, smiling faintly, and making\\r\\nno protests.</p>\\r\\n<p>He got up lazily to cross-examine Chris. \"Dr. Ryan,\\r\\nwhen Daniel Feldman was examined by the Captain of\\r\\nthe <i>Navaho</i> after arriving at Mars station, did you identify\\r\\nhim then as having been Dr. Daniel Feldman?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She glanced at Matthews, who seemed puzzled but\\r\\nunconcerned. \"That\\'s correct,\" she admitted. \"But\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And you later saw him delivered to the surface of\\r\\nMars. Is that also correct?\" When she assented, Jake\\r\\nhesitated. Then he frowned. \"What did you do then?\\r\\nDid you report him or send anyone to look after him\\r\\nor anything like that?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Certainly not,\" she answered. \"He was no\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You did absolutely nothing about him after you\\r\\nidentified him and saw him delivered here? You\\'re quite\\r\\nsure of that?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I did nothing.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake stood quietly for a moment, then shrugged. \"No\\r\\nmore questions.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Matthews finished things in a plea for the salvation\\r\\nof all humanity from the danger of such men as Daniel\\r\\nFeldman. He was looking smug, as was Chris.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_51\">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>Wilson turned to Jake. \"Has the defense anything to\\r\\nsay?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"A few things, Your Honor.\" Jake stood up, suddenly\\r\\nlooking certain and pleased. \"We are happy to\\r\\nadmit everything factual the Lobby had testified. Daniel\\r\\nFeldman performed a surgical operation on Harriet\\r\\nLynn in the village of Einstein. But when has it been\\r\\nillegal for a member of the Medical profession to\\r\\nperform an operation, even with small chance of success,\\r\\nwithin an accepted area for such operation? There\\r\\nhas been no evidence adduced that any crime or act of\\r\\neven unethical conduct was committed.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>That brought Chris and Matthews to their feet. Wilson\\r\\nwas relaxed again, looking as if he\\'d swallowed a\\r\\nwhole cage of canaries. He banged his gavel down.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake picked up two ragged and dog-eared volumes\\r\\nfrom his table. \"Case of Harding vs. Southport, 2043,\\r\\nestablishes that a Lobby is responsible for any member\\r\\non Mars. It is also responsible for informing the authorities\\r\\nof any criminal conduct on the part of its\\r\\nmembers or any former member known to it. Failure to\\r\\nreport shall be considered an admission that the Lobby\\r\\nrecognizes the member as one in good standing and\\r\\naccepts responsibility for that member\\'s conduct.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"At the time Daniel Feldman arrived, Dr. Christina\\r\\nRyan was the highest appointed representative of Medical\\r\\nLobby in Southport, with full authority. She identified\\r\\nFeldman as having been a doctor, without stipulating\\r\\nany change in status. She made no further report\\r\\nto any authority concerning Daniel Feldman\\'s presence\\r\\nhere. It seems obvious that Medical Lobby at Southport\\r\\nthereby accepted Daniel Feldman as a doctor in good\\r\\nstanding for whose conduct the Lobby accepted full\\r\\nresponsibility.\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_52\">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>Wilson studied the book Jake held out, and nodded.\\r\\n\"Seems pretty clear-cut to me,\" he agreed, passing the\\r\\nbook on to Matthews. \"There\\'s still the charge that Dr.\\r\\nFeldman operated outside a hospital.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No reason he shouldn\\'t,\" Jake said. He handed over\\r\\nthe other volume. \"This is the charter for Medical\\r\\nLobby on Mars. Medical Lobby agrees to perform all\\r\\nnecessary surgical and medical services for the planet,\\r\\nthough at the signing of this charter there was no hospital\\r\\non Mars. Necessarily, Medical Lobby agreed to\\r\\nperform surgery outside of any hospital, then. But to\\r\\nmake it plainer, there\\'s a later paragraph\\xe2\\x80\\x94page 181\\xe2\\x80\\x94that\\r\\ndefines each hospital zone as extending not less than\\r\\nthree nor more than one hundred miles. Einstein is\\r\\nabout one hundred and ten miles from the nearest hospital\\r\\nat Southport, so Einstein comes under the original\\r\\ncharter provisions. Dr. Feldman was forced by charter\\r\\nprovisions to protect the good name of his Lobby by\\r\\nundertaking any necessary surgery in Einstein.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He waited until Matthews had scanned that book,\\r\\nthen took it back and began packing a big bag. Doc\\r\\nsaw that his possessions and the microscope were already\\r\\nin the bag. The old man paid no attention to the\\r\\narguments of Matthews before the bench.</p>\\r\\n<p>Abruptly Wilson pounded his gavel. \"This court finds\\r\\nthat Dr. Daniel Feldman is qualified to practice all the\\r\\narts and skills of the medical profession on Mars and\\r\\nthat he acted ethically in the performance of his duties\\r\\nin the case of the deceased Harriet Lynn,\" he ruled.\\r\\n\"The costs of the case shall be billed to Medical Lobby\\r\\nof Southport.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He took off his robe and moved rapidly toward his\\r\\nprivate quarters. Court was closed.</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc got up shakily, not daring to believe fully what<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_53\">[Pg 53]</a></span>\\r\\nhe had heard. He started toward Jake, trying to avoid\\r\\nbumping into Chris. But she would not be avoided. She\\r\\nstood in front of him, screaming accusations and threats\\r\\nthat reminded him of the only fight they\\'d ever had\\r\\nduring their brief marriage.</p>\\r\\n<p>When she ran down, he finally met her eyes. \"You\\'re\\r\\na helluva doctor,\" he told her harshly. \"You spend all\\r\\nyour time fighting me when there\\'s a plague out there\\r\\nthat may be worse than any disease we\\'ve ever known.\\r\\nTake a look at what lies under the black specks on your\\r\\ncorpses. You\\'ll find the first Martian disease. And\\r\\nmaybe if you begin working on that now, you can learn\\r\\nto be a real doctor in time to do something about it.\\r\\nBut I doubt it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She fell back from him then. \"Research! You\\'ve been\\r\\ndoing unauthorized research!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Prove it,\" he suggested. \"But you\\'d be a lot smarter\\r\\nto try some yourself, and to hell with your precious\\r\\nrules.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He followed Jake out to the tractor.</p>\\r\\n<p>Surprisingly, the old man was sweating now. He\\r\\nshook his head at Doc\\'s look, and his grin was uncertain.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Matthews is an incompetent,\" he said. \"They could\\r\\nhave had you, Doc. That charter is so sloppy a man\\r\\ncan prove anything by it, and building a hospital here\\r\\ndid bring in Earth rules. Wilson went out on a limb in\\r\\nletting you go. But I guess we got away with it. Let\\'s\\r\\nget out of here.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc climbed into the tractor more soberly. They had\\r\\nescaped this time. But there would be another time,\\r\\nand he was pretty sure that would be Chris\\' round. He\\r\\nhad no intention of giving up his research.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_54\">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"VII\"></a>VII</h2>\\r\\n<h3>Plague</h3>\\r\\n<p>Dr. Feldman leaned back from his microscope and\\r\\nlighted another bracky weed. He glanced about the\\r\\nroom and sighed wearily. Maybe he\\'d been better off\\r\\nwhen he had no friends and couldn\\'t risk the safety of\\r\\nothers in an effort to do research that was the highest\\r\\ncrime on two worlds.</p>\\r\\n<p>The evidence of his work was hidden thirty feet beyond\\r\\nhis former laboratory in Jake\\'s village, with a\\r\\ntunnel that led from another root-cellar. The theory was\\r\\nthe old one that the best place to avoid discovery was\\r\\nwhere you had already been discovered. If their spies\\r\\nhad identified his former hangout, they\\'d never expect\\r\\nto have him set up research nearby. It was a nice theory,\\r\\nbut he wasn\\'t sure of it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake looked up from a cot where he\\'d been watching\\r\\nthe improvised culture incubator. \"Stop tearing yourself\\r\\nto bits, Doc. We know the danger and we\\'re still\\r\\ndarned glad to have you here working on this.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I\\'m trying to put myself together into a whole man,\"\\r\\nDoc told him. \"But I seem to come out wholly a fool.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yeah, sure. Sometimes it takes a fool to get things\\r\\ndone; wise men wait too long for the right time. How\\'s\\r\\nthe bug hunt?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc grunted in disgust and swung back to the microscope.\\r\\nThen he gave up as his tired eyes refused to\\r\\nfocus. \"Why don\\'t you people revolt?\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_55\">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"They tried it twice. But they were just a bunch of\\r\\npariahs shipped here to live in peonage. They couldn\\'t\\r\\ndo much. The first time Earth cut off shipments and\\r\\nstarved them. Next time the villages had the answer\\r\\nto that but the cities had to fight for Earth or starve,\\r\\nso they whipped us. And there\\'s always the threat that\\r\\nEarth could send over unmanned war rockets loaded\\r\\nwith fissionables.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"So it\\'s hopeless?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"So nothing! The Lobbies are poisoning themselves,\\r\\nlike cutting off Medical service until they cut themselves\\r\\nout of a job. It\\'s just a matter of time. Go back\\r\\nto the bugs, Doc.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc sighed and reached for his notes. \"I wish I knew\\r\\nmore Martian history. I\\'ve been wondering whether this\\r\\nbug may not have been what killed off the old Martians.\\r\\nSomething had to do it, the way they disappeared.\\r\\nI wish I knew enough to make an investigation of those\\r\\nruins out there.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Durwood!\" Jake had propped himself on an elbow,\\r\\nstaring at Doc in surprise.</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc scowled. \"Clive Durwood, you mean? The archeologist\\r\\nwho dug up what little we know about the\\r\\nruins?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yeah, before he went back to Earth and started living\\r\\noff his lectures. He came here again three years ago\\r\\nand dropped dead in Edison on the way to some other\\r\\nruins. Heart failure, they called it, though it was more\\r\\nlike the two old farmers who ran themselves to death\\r\\nlast month. I saw him when they buried him. His face\\r\\nlooked funny, and I think he had those little specks,\\r\\nthough I may remember wrong.\" He grimaced. \"Mars\\r\\nis tough, Doc; it has to be. Some of the plant seeds\\r\\nDurwood found in the ruins grew! Maybe your bugs<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_56\">[Pg 56]</a></span>\\r\\nwaited a million years till we came along.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"What about the farmers? Did they meet Durwood?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake nodded. \"Must have. He lived in their village\\r\\nmost of the time.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc went through his notes. He\\'d asked for reports\\r\\non all deaths, and he finally found the account. The\\r\\ntwo old men had been nervous and fidgety for weeks.\\r\\nThey were twins, living by themselves, and nobody\\r\\npaid much attention. Then one morning both were\\r\\nseen running wildly in circles. The village managed to\\r\\ntie them up, but they died of exhaustion shortly after.</p>\\r\\n<p>It wasn\\'t a pretty picture. The disease might have an\\r\\nincubation period of nearly fifteen years, judging by\\r\\nthe length of time it had taken to hit Durwood. It must\\r\\nspread from person to person during an early contagious\\r\\nstage, leaving widening circles behind Durwood\\r\\nand those first infected. When matured, any other sickness\\r\\nwould set it off, with few symptoms of its own.\\r\\nBut without help, it still killed its victims, apparently\\r\\ndriving them madly toward frenzied physical effort.</p>\\r\\n<p>He studied the culture on a slide again. He\\'d tried\\r\\nKoch\\'s method to get a pure strain, splattering the bugs\\r\\nonto a native starchy root and plucking off individual\\r\\ncolonies. About twenty specimens had been treated\\r\\nwith every chemical he could find. So far he\\'d found a\\r\\nfew things that seemed to stop their growth, but nothing\\r\\nthat killed them, except stuff far too harsh to use\\r\\nin living tissue.</p>\\r\\n<p>He had nearly forty cases of deaths that showed\\r\\nsymptoms now, and he went back over them, looking\\r\\nfor anything in common that went back ten to twenty\\r\\nyears before death. There were no rashes nor blisters.\\r\\nA few had had apparent colds, but such were too common\\r\\nto mean anything.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_57\">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>Only one thing appeared, about fourteen years before\\r\\ntheir deaths. The people interviewed about the victims\\r\\nmight be vague about most things, but they remembered\\r\\nthe time when \"Jim had the jumping headache.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Jake,\" Doc called, \"what\\'s jumping headache? Most\\r\\npeople seem to have it some time or other, but I haven\\'t\\r\\nrun across a case of it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Sure you have, Doc. Mamie Brander\\'s little girl a\\r\\nfew weeks ago. Feels like your pulse is going to rip\\r\\nyour skull off, right here. Can\\'t eat because chewing\\r\\ndrives you crazy. Back of your head, neck and shoulders\\r\\nswell up for about a week. Then it goes away.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Then it goes away\\xe2\\x80\\x94for fourteen years, until it comes\\r\\nback to kill!</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc stared at his charts in sudden horror. It was a\\r\\nnew disease\\xe2\\x80\\x94thought to be some virus, but not considered\\r\\ndangerous. Selznik\\'s migraine, according to medical\\r\\nusage; you treated it with hot pads and anodyne,\\r\\nand it went away easily enough.</p>\\r\\n<p>He\\'d seen hundreds of such cases on Earth. There\\r\\nmust be millions who had been hit by it. The patent-medicine\\r\\nbranch of the Lobby had even brought out\\r\\nsomething called Nograine to use for self-treatment.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Something important?\" Jake wanted to know.</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman nodded. \"How much weight do you swing\\r\\nin other villages, Jake?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"People sort of do me favors when I ask,\" Jake admitted.\\r\\n\"Like swiping those medical journals from\\r\\nNorthport for you, or like Molly Badger getting that\\r\\njob as maid to spy on Chris Ryan. Name it and I\\'ll do\\r\\nmy best.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc had a vague idea of village politics, but he had\\r\\nmore important things to think of. Most of his foul\\r\\nmood had disappeared with the clue he\\'d stumbled on,<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_58\">[Pg 58]</a></span>\\r\\nand his chief worry now was to clinch the facts.</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman considered the problem. \"I want a report on\\r\\nevery case of jumping headache in every village\\xe2\\x80\\x94who\\r\\nhad it, when, and how old they were. This place first,\\r\\nbut every village you can reach. And I\\'ll want someone\\r\\nto take a letter to Chris Ryan.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake frowned at that, but went out to issue instructions.\\r\\nDoc sat down at a battered old typewriter. Writing\\r\\nChris might do no good, but some warning had to\\r\\nbe gotten through to Earth, where the vast resources\\r\\nof Medical Lobby could be thrown into the task of\\r\\nfinding the cause and cure of the disease. The connection\\r\\nwith Selznik\\'s migraine had to be reported. If something\\r\\ncould blast the Lobby into action, it wouldn\\'t matter\\r\\nquite so much what they did to him. He wasn\\'t\\r\\nfoolish enough to expect gratitude from them, but he\\r\\nwas getting used to the idea that his days were numbered.\\r\\nThe plague was more important than what happened\\r\\nto him.</p>\\r\\n<p>The letter had been dispatched by the time Jake returned.\\r\\n\"Here\\'s the dope for this village. Everybody\\r\\naccounted for except you.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Never had it, Jake.\" Feldman went down the list.\\r\\n\"Most of it fourteen years ago. That fits. About the\\r\\nonly exceptions are the kids who seem to get it between\\r\\nthe ages of two and three. Eighty-seven out of ninety-one!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He stared at the figures sickly. Most of the village\\r\\nnot only had the plague but must be near the end of\\r\\nthe incubation period. It looked as if most of the village\\r\\nwould be dead before another year passed.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Bad?\" Jake asked.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The first symptom of Martian fever.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The old man whistled, the lines around his eyes tight<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_59\">[Pg 59]</a></span>ening.\\r\\n\"Must be me,\" he decided. \"I\\'m the guy who\\r\\nmust have brought it here, then. I used to spend a lot\\r\\nof time with Durwood at his diggings!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>There was a constant commotion all that day and the\\r\\nnext as runners went out to the villages and came back\\r\\nwith reports. The variation from village to village was\\r\\nonly slight. Most of Mars seemed to have advanced cases\\r\\nof Martian fever.</p>\\r\\n<p>Without animals for investigation and study, real research\\r\\nwas difficult. Doc also needed an electron microscope.\\r\\nHe was reasonably sure that the disease must\\r\\ntravel through the nerves, but he had found no proof\\r\\nbeyond the hard lump at the base of the neck. There\\r\\nit was a fair-sized organism. Elsewhere he could find\\r\\nnothing, until the black specks developed.</p>\\r\\n<p>His eyes ached from trying to see more than was\\r\\nvisible in the microscope. The tantalizing suggestions\\r\\nof filaments around the nuclei might be the form of\\r\\nplague that was contagious. They might even be the\\r\\ntrue form of the bug, with the bigger cell only a transition\\r\\nstage. There were a number of diseases that involved\\r\\ncomplicated changes in the organisms that\\r\\ncaused them. But he couldn\\'t be sure.</p>\\r\\n<p>He finally buried his head in his hands, trying to do\\r\\nby pure thought what he couldn\\'t do in any other way.\\r\\nAnd even there, he lacked training. He was a doctor,\\r\\nnot a xenobiologist. Research training had been taboo\\r\\nin school, except for a favored few.</p>\\r\\n<p>The reports continued to come in, confirming the\\r\\ndanger. They seemed to have the worst plague on their\\r\\nhands in all human history; and nobody who could do\\r\\nanything about it even knew of it.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Molly reports that your letter got some results,\"\\r\\nJake reported. \"Chris Ryan brought home one of the<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_60\">[Pg 60]</a></span>\\r\\nelectron microscopes and a bunch of equipment from\\r\\nthe hospital pathology room. Think she\\'ll get anywhere?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc doubted it. Damn it, he hadn\\'t meant for her to\\r\\ntry it, though she might have authority for routine experiments.\\r\\nBut it was like her to refuse to pass on the\\r\\nword without trying to prove her own suspicion of\\r\\nhim first.</p>\\r\\n<p>He tried to comfort himself with the fact that some\\r\\nmen were immune, or seemed so; about three out of a\\r\\nhundred showed no signs. If that immunity was hereditary,\\r\\nit might save the race. If not....</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake came in at twilight with a grim face. \"More\\r\\nnews from Molly.

Lou was driving, while Doc and Jake\\r\\nbrooded silently in the back, paying no attention to the\\r\\ncolors that were blazoned over the dunes. The cat-and-mouse\\r\\ngame was getting to Doc. There was no real assurance\\r\\nthat the village they were approaching might\\r\\nnot be the target the Lobby had chosen for the next\\r\\ninvestigation.</p>\\r\\n<p>Lou braked the tractor to a sudden halt, and pointed.</p>\\r\\n<p>A figure was running frantically over one of the low\\r\\ndunes with the little red sun behind him. He seemed\\r\\nheaded toward them, but as he drew nearer they could\\r\\nsee that he had no definite direction. He simply ran,\\r\\npumping his legs frantically as if all the devils of hell\\r\\nwere after him. His body swayed from side to side in\\r\\nexhaustion, but his arms and legs pumped on.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Stop him!\" Jake ordered, and Lou swung the tractor.\\r\\nIt halted squarely in the runner\\'s path, and the figure\\r\\nstruck against it and toppled.</p>\\r\\n<p>The legs went on pumping, digging into the dirt and\\r\\ngravel, but the man was too far gone to rise. Jake and\\r\\nLou shoved him through the doors into the tractor and\\r\\nDoc yanked off his aspirator.</p>\\r\\n<p>The man was giving vent to a kind of ululating cry,<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_62\">[Pg 62]</a></span>\\r\\nweakened now almost to a whine that rose and fell with\\r\\nthe motion of his legs. Sweat had once streaked his\\r\\nhaggard face, but it was dry and blanched to a pasty\\r\\ngray.</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc injected enough narcotic to quiet a maddened\\r\\nbull. It had no effect, except to upset the rhythm of the\\r\\narms and legs. It took five more minutes for the man\\r\\nto die.</p>\\r\\n<p>The specks were larger this time\\xe2\\x80\\x94the size of periods\\r\\nin twelve-point type. The lump at the base of the skull\\r\\nwas as big as a small hen\\'s egg.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"From Edison, like the others so far. Jack Kooley,\"\\r\\nJake answered Doc\\'s question. \"Durwood spent a lot of\\r\\ntime here on his first expedition, so it\\'s getting the worst\\r\\nof it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc pulled the aspirator mask back over the man\\'s\\r\\nface and they carried him out and laid him on a low\\r\\ndune. They couldn\\'t risk returning the corpse to its\\r\\npeople.</p>\\r\\n<p>This was only the primary circle of infection, direct\\r\\nfrom Durwood. The second circle could be ten times\\r\\nas large, as the infection spread from one to a few to\\r\\nmany. So far it was localized. But it wouldn\\'t stay that\\r\\nway.</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc climbed slowly out of the tractor, lugging his\\r\\nsmall supplies of equipment, while Jake made arrangements\\r\\nfor them to spend the night in a deserted house.\\r\\nBut the figure of the runner and his own failures to\\r\\nfind more about the disease kept haunting Doc. He\\r\\nbegan setting up his equipment grimly.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Better get some sleep,\" Jake suggested. \"You\\'re a\\r\\nmite more tired than you think. Anyhow, I thought\\r\\nyou told me you couldn\\'t do any more with what you\\'ve\\r\\ngot.\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_63\">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman looked at the supplies he had spread out,\\r\\nand shook his head wearily. He\\'d been over every\\r\\nchemical and combination a dozen times, without results\\r\\nthat showed in the limited magnification of the optical\\r\\nmike.</p>\\r\\n<p>He snapped the case shut and hit the rude table with\\r\\nthe heel of his hand. \"There are other supplies. Jake,\\r\\ndo you have any signal to get in touch with Molly\\r\\nat the Ryan house?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Three raps on the rear left window. I\\'ll get Lou.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No!\" Doc came to his feet, reaching for his jacket.\\r\\n\"They\\'re looking for three men now. It\\'s safer if I go\\r\\nalone\\xe2\\x80\\x94and I\\'m the only one who knows what supplies\\r\\nare needed. With luck, I may even get the electron mike.\\r\\nGot a gun I can borrow?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake found one somewhere, an old revolver with a\\r\\nfew loads. He began protesting, but Doc overruled him\\r\\nsharply. Three men could no more fight off the police\\r\\nthan one, if they were spotted. He swung toward the\\r\\ntractor.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You\\'d better start spreading the word on everything\\r\\nwe know. If people realize they\\'re already safe or\\r\\ndoomed it\\'ll be better than having them going crazy to\\r\\navoid contagion.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Most of the villages know already,\" Jake told him.\\r\\n\"And damn it, get back here, Doc. If you can\\'t make\\r\\nit, turn tail quick, and we\\'ll think of something else.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Southport seemed normal enough as Doc drove\\r\\nthrough its streets. The stereo house was open, and the\\r\\nlittle shops were brightly lighted. He stopped once to\\r\\npull a copy of Southport\\'s little newspaper from a dispenser.\\r\\nAll was quiet on its front page, too.</p>\\r\\n<p>As usual, though, the facts were buried inside. The\\r\\neditorial was pouring too much oil on the waters in its<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_64\">[Pg 64]</a></span>\\r\\nlauding of the role of Medical Lobby on Mars for no\\r\\napparent reason. The death notices no longer listed the\\r\\ncause of death. Medical knew something was up, at least,\\r\\nand was worried.</p>\\r\\n<p>He parked the tractor behind Chris\\' house and slipped\\r\\nto the proper window. Everything was seemingly quiet\\r\\nthere. At his knock, the shade was drawn back, and he\\r\\ncaught a brief glimpse of Molly looking out. A moment\\r\\nlater she opened the rear lock to let him into the\\r\\nkitchen.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Shh. She\\'s still up, I think. What can I do, Doc?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He tried to smile at her. \"Hide me until it\\'s safe to\\r\\nget into her laboratory. I\\'ve got to\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The inner kitchen was kicked open and Chris stood\\r\\nbeyond it, holding a cocked gun in her hand.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It took longer than I expected, Dan,\" she said\\r\\nquietly. \"But after your letter, I knew you\\'d swallow the\\r\\nbait. You bloody fool! Did you really believe I\\'d start\\r\\ndoing research here just because of your imaginings?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He slumped slowly back against the sink. \"So this is\\r\\na fool\\'s errand, then? There never was any equipment\\r\\nhere?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The equipment\\'s here\\xe2\\x80\\x94in my office. I guessed your\\r\\nspies would report it, so it had to be here. But it won\\'t\\r\\nhelp you now, pariah Feldman!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He came from his braced position against the sink\\r\\nlike a spring uncoiling. He expected her to shoot, but\\r\\nhoped the surprise would ruin her aim. Then it was\\r\\ntoo late, and his boot hit the gun savagely, knocking it\\r\\nfrom her hand. Life in the villages had hardened him\\r\\nsurprisingly. She was comparatively helpless in his\\r\\nhands. A few minutes later, he had her bound securely\\r\\nwith surgical tape Molly brought him. She raged furiously\\r\\nin the chair where he\\'d dumped her, then gave up.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_65\">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"They\\'ll get you, Daniel Feldman!\" Surprisingly,\\r\\nthere was no rage in her voice now. \"You won\\'t get\\r\\naway from us. The planet isn\\'t big enough.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I got away from your trial,\" he reminded her. \"And\\r\\nI got away and lived when you left me without a\\r\\nchance on the ground of the spaceport.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She laughed harshly. \"<i>You</i> got away then? You fool,\\r\\nwho do you think gave you the extra battery so you\\r\\ncould live long enough to be helped at the spaceport?\\r\\nWho hired a fool like Matthews so you wouldn\\'t get the\\r\\ndeath sentence you deserved? Who let you get away\\r\\nas an herb doctor for months before you set yourself\\r\\nup as God and a traitor to mankind again?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It shook him, as it was probably intended to do. How\\r\\nhad she known about the extra battery? He\\'d always\\r\\nassumed that Ben had returned to give it to him. But\\r\\nin that case, Chris couldn\\'t know of it. Then he hardened\\r\\nhimself again. In the old days, she\\'d always had\\r\\none trump card he couldn\\'t beat and hadn\\'t expected.\\r\\nBut too much was involved for games now.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Any police around, Molly?\" he asked.</p>\\r\\n<p>Molly came back a minute later to report that everything\\r\\nlooked clear and to show him where the equipment\\r\\nhad been set up in Chris\\' office. It was all there,\\r\\nincluding the electron mike\\xe2\\x80\\x94a beautiful little portable\\r\\nmodel. There was even a small incubator with its own\\r\\nheat source into which he immediately transferred the\\r\\nlittle bottles he\\'d been keeping warm against his skin.\\r\\nMost of the equipment had never been unpacked, which\\r\\nmade loading it onto his tractor ridiculously easy.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Better come with me now, Molly,\" he suggested at\\r\\nlast. Then he turned to Chris, who was watching him\\r\\nwith almost no expression. \"You can wriggle your chair\\r\\nto the phone in half an hour, I guess. Knock the phone<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_66\">[Pg 66]</a></span>\\r\\noff and yell for help. It\\'s better than you deserve, unless\\r\\nyou really did leave me that battery.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You won\\'t get away with it,\" she told him again,\\r\\ncalmly this time.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No,\" he admitted. \"Probably not. But maybe the\\r\\nhuman race will, if I have time to find an answer to the\\r\\nplague you won\\'t see under your nose. But you won\\'t\\r\\nget away with it, either. In the long run, your kind\\r\\nnever do.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Molly was sniffling as they drove away. It had probably\\r\\nbeen the best life she\\'d known, Doc supposed.\\r\\nChris could be kind to menials. But now Molly\\'s work\\r\\nwas done, and she\\'d have to disappear into the villages.\\r\\nHe let her off at the first village and drove on alone.\\r\\nHe was itching to get to the microscope now, hardly\\r\\nable to wait through the long journey back to Jake.\\r\\nHis impatience grew with each mile.</p>\\r\\n<p>Finally he gave up. He swung the tractor into a small\\r\\ngulley between sand dunes, left the motor idling and\\r\\npulled down the shades the villagers used for blackout\\r\\ntraveling. There was power enough for the mike here,\\r\\nand the cab was big enough for what he had to do.</p>\\r\\n<p>He mounted the mike on the tractor seat and began\\r\\nlaying out the collection of smears and cultures he had\\r\\nbrought. It had been years since he\\'d made a film for\\r\\nthe electron mike, but he found it all came back to him\\r\\nas he worked.</p>\\r\\n<p>His hands were sweating with tension as he inserted\\r\\nthe first film into the chamber. He had the magnetic\\r\\n\"lenses\" set for twenty thousand power, but a quick\\r\\nglance showed it was too weak. He raised the power\\r\\nto fifty thousand.</p>\\r\\n<p>The filaments were there, clear and distinct.</p>\\r\\n<p>He turned on the little tape recorder that had been<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_67\">[Pg 67]</a></span>\\r\\npart of Chris\\' equipment and set the microphone where\\r\\nhe could dictate into it without stopping to make\\r\\nclumsy notes. He readjusted the focus carefully, carrying\\r\\non a running commentary.</p>\\r\\n<p>Then he gasped. Each of the little filaments carried\\r\\nthree tiny darker sections; each was a cell, complete in itself,\\r\\nwith the typical Martian triple nucleus.</p>\\r\\n<p>He put a film with a tiny section of the nerve tissue\\r\\nfrom a corpse into the chamber next, and again a quick\\r\\nglance at the screen was enough. The filaments were\\r\\nthere, thickly crowded among nerve cells. They <i>did</i>\\r\\ntravel along the nerves to reach the base of the brain\\r\\nbefore the larger lump could form.</p>\\r\\n<p>A specimen from one of the black specks was even\\r\\nmore interesting. The filaments were there, but some\\r\\nwere changed or changing into tiny, round cells, also\\r\\nwith the triple dark spots of nuclei. Those must be the\\r\\nfinal form that was released to infect others. Probably\\r\\nat first these multiplied directly in epithelial tissue, so\\r\\nthat there was a rapid contagion of infection. Eventually,\\r\\nthey must form the filaments that invaded the\\r\\nnerves and caused the brief bodily reaction that was\\r\\nSelznik\\'s migraine. Then the body adapted to them and\\r\\nthey began to incubate slowly, developing into the\\r\\nlarge cells he had first seen. When \"ripe\", the big cells\\r\\nbroke apart into millions of the tiny round ones that\\r\\nwent back to the nerve endings, causing the black spots\\r\\nand killing the host.</p>\\r\\n<p>He knew his enemy now, at least.</p>\\r\\n<p>He reached for the controls, increasing the magnification.\\r\\nHe would lose resolution, but he might find\\r\\nsomething more at the extreme limits of the mike.</p>\\r\\n<p>Something wet and cold gushed into his face. He\\r\\njerked back, trying to wipe it off, but it was already<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_68\">[Pg 68]</a></span>\\r\\nevaporating, and there was a thick, acrid odor in the\\r\\ncab. He grabbed for his aspirator, then tried to reach\\r\\nthe airlock. But paralysis was already spreading through\\r\\nhim, and he toppled to the floor before he could escape.</p>\\r\\n<p>When he came to, it was morning outside, and Chris\\r\\nwas waiting inside the cab with two big Lobby policemen.\\r\\nA hypo in her hand must have been what revived\\r\\nhim.</p>\\r\\n<p>She touched the electron microscope with something\\r\\nlike affection. \"The Lobby technicians did a good job\\r\\non this, don\\'t you think, Dan? I warned you, but you\\r\\nwouldn\\'t listen. And now we\\'ve even got your own\\r\\ntaped words to prove you were doing forbidden research.\\r\\nFool!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She shook her head pityingly as the tractor began\\r\\nmoving with two others toward Southport.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You and your phony diseases. A little skin disorder,\\r\\nSelznik\\'s migraine, and a few cases of psychosis to make\\r\\na new disease. Do you think Medical Lobby can\\'t check\\r\\non such simple things? Or didn\\'t you expect us to hear\\r\\nof your open talk of revolt and realize you were planning\\r\\nto create some new germ to wipe out the Earth\\r\\nforces. Maybe those runners of yours were real, mass\\r\\nmurderer!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She drew out another hypo and shoved the needle\\r\\ninto his arm. Necrosynth\\xe2\\x80\\x94enough to keep him unconscious\\r\\nfor twenty-four hours. He started to curse her,\\r\\nbut the drug acted before he could complete the\\r\\nthought.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_69\">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"IX\"></a>IX</h2>\\r\\n<h3>Judgment</h3>\\r\\n<p>Doc woke to see sunlight shining through a heavily\\r\\nbarred window that must be in the official Southport\\r\\njail. He waited a few minutes for his head to clear and\\r\\nthen sat up; necrosynth left no hangover, at least.</p>\\r\\n<p>The sound of steps outside was followed by the\\r\\nsqueak of a key in the lock. \"Fifteen minutes, Judge\\r\\nWilson,\" a voice said.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Thank you, officer.\" Wilson came into the cell, carrying\\r\\na tray of breakfast and a copy of the Northport\\r\\n<i>Gazette</i>. He began unloading bracky weeds from his\\r\\npocket while Doc attacked the breakfast.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"They tossed the book at you, Doc,\" he said. \"You\\r\\nhaven\\'t got a chance, and there\\'s nothing the villages\\r\\ncan do. Trial\\'s set for tomorrow at Northport, and it\\'s\\r\\nin closed session. We can\\'t get you off this time.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc nodded. \"Thanks for coming, even if there\\'s\\r\\nnothing you can do. I\\'ve been living on borrowed time\\r\\nfor a year, anyhow, so I have no right to kick. But\\r\\nwho\\'s \\'we\\'?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The villages. I\\'ve been part of their organization for\\r\\nyears.\" The old man sighed heavily. \"You might say a\\r\\nrevolution has been going on since I can remember,\\r\\nthough most villagers don\\'t know it. We\\'ve just been\\r\\nwaiting our time. Now we\\'ve stopped waiting and the\\r\\nrifles will be coming out\\xe2\\x80\\x94rifles made in village shops.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_70\">[Pg 70]</a></span>\\r\\nThe villages are going to rebel, even if we\\'re all dead\\r\\nof plague in a month.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc Feldman nodded and reached for the bracky. He\\r\\nknew that this was their way of trying to make him\\r\\nfeel his work hadn\\'t been for nothing, and he was grateful\\r\\nfor Wilson\\'s visit. \"It was a good year for me.\\r\\nDamned good. But time\\'s running short. I\\'d better brief\\r\\nyou on the latest on the plague.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Wilson began making notes until Doc was finished.\\r\\nFinally he got up as steps sounded from the hall. \"Anything\\r\\nelse?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Just a guess. A lot of Earth germs can\\'t live in Mars-normal\\r\\nflesh; maybe this can\\'t live in Earth-normal. Tell\\r\\nthem so long for me.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"So long, Doc.\" He shook hands briefly and was waiting\\r\\nat the door when the guard opened it.</p>\\r\\n<p>An hour later, the Lobby police took Feldman to the\\r\\nNorthport shuttle rocket. They had some trouble on\\r\\nthe way; a runner cut down the street, with the crowds\\r\\nfrantically rushing out of his way. Terror was reaching\\r\\nthe cities already.</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc flashed a look at Chris. \"Mob hysteria. Like flying\\r\\nsaucers and wriggly tops, I suppose?\" he asked, before\\r\\nthe guard could stop him.</p>\\r\\n<p>They locked his legs, but left his hands free in the\\r\\nrocket. He unfolded the paper Wilson had brought and\\r\\nburied his face in it. Then he swore. They <i>were</i> explaining\\r\\nthe runners as a case of mob hysteria!</p>\\r\\n<p>Northport was calmer. Apparently they had yet to\\r\\nhave first-hand experience with the plague. But now\\r\\nnothing seemed quite real to Doc, even when they\\r\\nlocked him into the big Northport jail. The whole ritual\\r\\nof the Lobbies seemed like a fantasy after the villages.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_71\">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>It snapped back into focus, however, when they led\\r\\nhim into the trial room of the Medical Lobby building.\\r\\nIt was a smaller version of his trial on Earth. Fear\\r\\nwashed in by association. The complete lack of humanity\\r\\nin the procedure was something from a half-remembered\\r\\nand horrible past.</p>\\r\\n<p>The presiding officer asked the routine question: \"Is\\r\\nthe prisoner represented by counsel?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Blane, the dapper little prosecutor, arose quickly.\\r\\n\"The prisoner is a pariah, Sir Magistrate.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Very well. The court will accept the protective\\r\\nfunction for the prisoner. You may proceed.\"</p>\\r\\n<p><i>I\\'ll be judge, I\\'ll be jury.</i> And prosecution and defense.\\r\\nIt made for a lot less trouble. Of course, if Space\\r\\nLobby had asserted interest, it would have gone to a\\r\\nsupposedly neutral court. But as usual, Space was happy\\r\\nto leave it in the hands of Medical.</p>\\r\\n<p>The tape was played as evidence. Doc frowned. The\\r\\nwords were his, but there had been a lot of editing\\r\\nthat subtly changed the import of his notes.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I protest,\" he challenged. \"It\\'s not an accurate version.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The Lobby magistrate turned a wooden face to him.\\r\\n\"Does the prisoner have a different version to introduce?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No, but\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The evidence is accepted. One of the prisoner\\'s six\\r\\nprotests will be charged against him.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Blane smiled smoothly and held up a small package.\\r\\n\"We wish to introduce this drug as evidence that the\\r\\nprisoner is a confirmed addict, morally irresponsible\\r\\nunder addiction. This is a package of so-called bracky\\r\\nweed, a vile and noxious substance found in his possession.\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_72\">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"It has alkaloids no more harmful than nicotine,\"\\r\\nFeldman stated sharply.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Do you contend that you find the taste pleasing?\"\\r\\nBlane asked.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It\\'s bitter, but I\\'ve gotten used to it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I\\'ve tasted it,\" the magistrate said. \"Evidence accepted.\\r\\nTwo deductions, one for irregularity of presentation.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc shrugged and sat back. He\\'d tested his rights\\r\\nand found what he expected. It was hard to see now\\r\\nhow he had ever accepted such procedure. Jake must\\r\\nbe right; they\\'d been in power too long, and were making\\r\\nthe mistake of taking the velvet glove off the iron\\r\\nfist and flailing about for the sheer pleasure of power.</p>\\r\\n<p>It dragged on, while he became a greater and greater\\r\\nmonster on the record. But finally it was over, and the\\r\\nmagistrate turned to Feldman. \"You may present your\\r\\ndefense.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I ask complete freedom of expression,\" Doc said\\r\\nformally.</p>\\r\\n<p>The magistrate nodded. \"This is a closed court. Permission\\r\\ngranted. The recording will be scrambled.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The last bit ruined most of the purpose Doc had in\\r\\nmind. But it was too late to change. He could only hope\\r\\nthat some one of the Medical men present would remember\\r\\nsomething of what he said.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I have nothing to say for myself,\" he began. \"It\\r\\nwould be useless. But I had to do what I did. There\\'s\\r\\na plague outside. I\\'ve studied that plague, and I have\\r\\nknowledge which must be used against it....\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He sat down in three minutes. It had been useless.</p>\\r\\n<p>Blane arose, with a smile still plastered on his face.\\r\\n\"We, of course, recognize the existence of a new contagion,\\r\\nbut I believe we have established that this is one<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_73\">[Pg 73]</a></span>\\r\\ndisseminated by the prisoner himself, and probably not\\r\\ndirectly contagious. There have been many cases of fanatics\\r\\nready to destroy humanity to eliminate those\\r\\nthey hate. Now, surely, the prisoner has himself left no\\r\\nquestion of his attitude. He asserts he has knowledge\\r\\nand skill greater than the entire Medical Research staff.\\r\\nHe has attempted to intimidate us by threats. He is\\r\\nclearly psychopathic, and dangerously so. The prosecution\\r\\nrests.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The guards took Doc into the anteroom, where he\\r\\nwas supposed to hear nothing that went on. But their\\r\\ncuriosity was stronger than their discretion, and the\\r\\ndoor remained a trifle ajar.</p>\\r\\n<p>The magistrate began the discussion. \"The case seems\\r\\nfirm enough. It\\'s fortunate Dr. Ryan acted so quickly,\\r\\nwith some of the people getting nervous. Perhaps it\\r\\nmight be wise to publicize our verdict.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"My thought exactly,\" Blane agreed. \"If we show\\r\\nFeldman is responsible and that Medical is eliminating\\r\\nthe source of the infection, it may have a stabilizing\\r\\neffect.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Let\\'s hope so. The sentence will have to be death,\\r\\nof course. We can\\'t let such a rebellious psychopath\\r\\nlive. But this needs something more, it seems. You\\'ve\\r\\nprepared a recommendation, I suppose.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"There was the case of Albrecht Delier,\" Blane suggested.\\r\\n\"Something like that should have good publicity\\r\\nimpact.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It struck Doc that they sounded as if they believed\\r\\nthemselves\\xe2\\x80\\x94as the witch-burners had believed in\\r\\nwitches. He was sweating when the guards led him before\\r\\nthe bench.</p>\\r\\n<p>The magistrate rolled a pen slowly across his fingers\\r\\nas his eyes raked Feldman. \"Pariah Daniel Feldman, you<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_74\">[Pg 74]</a></span>\\r\\nhave been found guilty on all counts. Furthermore, your\\r\\nguilt must be shared by that entire section of Mars\\r\\nknown as the villages. Therefore the entire section shall\\r\\nbe banned and forbidden any and all services of the\\r\\nMedical Lobby for a period of one year.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Sir Magistrate!\" One of the members of Southport\\r\\nHospital staff was on his feet. \"Sir Magistrate, we can\\'t\\r\\ncut them off completely.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We must, Dr. Harkness. I appreciate the fine humanitarian\\r\\ntradition of our Lobby which lies behind\\r\\nyour protest, but at such a time as this the good of the\\r\\nbody politic requires drastic measures. Why not see me\\r\\nafter court, and we can discuss it then?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He turned back to Feldman, and his face was severe.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"The same education which has produced such fine\\r\\nyoung men as Dr. Harkness was wasted on you and\\r\\nperverted to endanger the whole race. No punishment\\r\\ncan equal your crimes, but there is one previously invoked\\r\\nfor a particularly horrible case, and it seems fitting\\r\\nthat you should be the fourth so sentenced.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Daniel Feldman, you are sentenced to be taken in\\r\\nto space beyond planetary limits, together with all material\\r\\nused by you in the furtherance of your criminal\\r\\nacts.

There\\r\\nwere periods when fear clogged his throat and left him\\r\\ngasping with the need to scream and beat his cell walls.\\r\\nThere were also times when it didn\\'t seem to matter,\\r\\nand when his only thoughts were for the villages and\\r\\nthe plague.</p>\\r\\n<p>They brought him the papers, where he was painted\\r\\nas a monster beside whom Jack the Ripper and Albrecht\\r\\nDelier were gentle amateurs. They were trying\\r\\nto focus all fear and resentment on him. Maybe it was\\r\\nworking. There were screaming crowds outside the jail,\\r\\nand the noise of their hatred was strong enough to carry\\r\\nthrough even the atmosphere of Mars. But there were\\r\\nalso signs that the Lobby was worried, as if afraid that\\r\\nsome attempt might still be made to rescue him.</p>\\r\\n<p>He\\'d looked forward to the trip to the airport as a\\r\\nway of judging public reaction. But apparently the\\r\\nLobby had no desire to test that. The guards led him\\r\\nup to the roof of the jail, where a rocket was waiting.\\r\\nThe landing space was too small for one of the station\\r\\nshuttles, but a little Northport-Southport shuttle was\\r\\nparked there after what must have been a difficult set-down.\\r\\nThe guards tested Doc\\'s manacles and forced\\r\\nhim into the shuttle.</p>\\r\\n<p>Inside, Chris was waiting, carrying an official automatic.\\r\\nThere was also a young pilot, looking nervous<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_76\">[Pg 76]</a></span>\\r\\nand unhappy. He was muttering under his breath as\\r\\nthe guards locked Doc\\'s legs to a seat and left.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"All right,\" Chris ordered. \"Up ship!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I tell you we\\'re overweight with you. I wasn\\'t counting\\r\\non three for the trip,\" the pilot protested. \"The\\r\\nonly thing that will get this into orbit with the station\\r\\nis faith. I\\'m loaded with every drop of fuel she\\'ll hold\\r\\nand it still isn\\'t enough.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"That\\'s your problem,\" Chris told him firmly.\\r\\n\"You\\'ve got your orders, and so have I. Up ship!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>If she had her own worries about the shuttle, she\\r\\ndidn\\'t show it. Chris had never been afraid to do what\\r\\nshe felt she should. The pilot stared at her doubtfully\\r\\nand finally turned back to his controls, still muttering.</p>\\r\\n<p>The shuttle lifted sluggishly, but there was no great\\r\\ndifficulty. Doc could see that there was even some fuel\\r\\nremaining when they slipped into the tube at the orbital\\r\\nstation. Chris went out, and other guards came\\r\\nin to free him.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"So long, Dr. Feldman,\" the pilot called softly as they\\r\\nled him out. Then the guards shoved him through the\\r\\nairlock into the station. Fifteen minutes later he was\\r\\nlocked into one of the cabins of the <i>Iroquois</i>, with all\\r\\nhis possessions stacked beside him.</p>\\r\\n<p>He grinned wryly. As an honest worker on the\\r\\n<i>Navaho</i> he\\'d been treated like an animal. Now, as a human\\r\\nfiend, he was installed in a luxury cabin of the\\r\\nfinest ship of the fleet, with constant spin to give a feeling\\r\\nof weight and more room than the entire tube crew\\r\\nhad known.</p>\\r\\n<p>He roamed the cabin until he found a little collapsible\\r\\ntable. He set the electron microscope up on that and\\r\\nplugged it in. It seemed a shame that good equipment\\r\\nshould be wasted along with his life. He wondered if<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_77\">[Pg 77]</a></span>\\r\\nthey would really throw it out into space with him.\\r\\nProbably they would.</p>\\r\\n<p>He pushed a button on the call board over the table\\r\\nand asked for the steward. There was a long wait, as\\r\\nif the procedure were being checked with some authority,\\r\\nbut finally he received a surly acknowledgement.\\r\\n\"Steward. Whatcha want?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"How\\'s the chance of getting some food?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You\\'re on first-class.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They could afford it, Doc decided. He wouldn\\'t cost\\r\\nthem much, considering the distance he was going.\\r\\n\"Bring me two complete dinners\\xe2\\x80\\x94one Earth-normal\\r\\nand one Mars-normal.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Okay, Feldman. But if you think you can suicide\\r\\nthat way, you\\'re wrong. You may be sick, but you\\'ll\\r\\nbe alive when they dump you.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>A sharp click interrupted him. \"That\\'s enough, Steward.\\r\\nCaptain Everts speaking. Dr. Feldman, you have\\r\\nmy apologies. Until you reach your destination, you\\r\\nare my passenger and entitled to every consideration of\\r\\nany other passenger except freedom of movement\\r\\nthrough the ship. I am always available for legitimate\\r\\ncomplaints.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Feldman shook his head. He\\'d heard of such men.\\r\\nBut he\\'d thought the species extinct.</p>\\r\\n<p>The steward brought his food in a thoroughly chastened\\r\\nmanner. He managed to find space for it and\\r\\ncame to attention. \"Is that all\\xe2\\x80\\x94sir?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>For a moment, as the smell of real steak reached him,\\r\\nDoc regretted the fact that his metabolism had been\\r\\nswitched. Then he shrugged. A little wouldn\\'t hurt him,\\r\\nthough there was no proper nourishment in it. He\\r\\nsqueezed some of the gravy and bits of meat into one\\r\\nof his bottles, sticking to his purpose; then he fell to<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_78\">[Pg 78]</a></span>\\r\\non the rest. But after a few bites, it was queerly unsatisfactory.\\r\\nThe seemingly unappealing Mars-normal\\r\\nragout suited his current tastes better, after all.</p>\\r\\n<p>Once the steward had cleared away the dishes, Doc\\r\\nwent to work. It was better than wasting his time in\\r\\ndread. He might even be able to leave some notes behind.</p>\\r\\n<p>A gong sounded, and a red light warned him that\\r\\nacceleration was due. He finished with his bottles, put\\r\\nthem into the incubator, and piled into his bunk, swallowing\\r\\none of the tablets of morphetal the ship furnished.</p>\\r\\n<p>Acceleration had ended, and a simple breakfast was\\r\\nwaiting when he awoke. There was also a red flashing\\r\\nlight over the call board. He flipped the switch while\\r\\nreaching for the coffee.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Captain Everts,\" the speaker said. \"May I join you\\r\\nin your cabin?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Come ahead,\" Feldman invited. He cut off the switch\\r\\nand glanced at the clock on the wall. There were less\\r\\nthan eleven hours left to him.</p>\\r\\n<p>Everts was a trim man of forty, erect but not rigid.\\r\\nThere was neither friendliness nor hostility in his\\r\\nglance. His words were courteous as Doc motioned toward\\r\\nthe tray of breakfast. \"I\\'ve already eaten, thank\\r\\nyou.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He accepted a chair. His voice was apologetic when\\r\\nhe began. \"This is a personal matter which I perhaps\\r\\nhave no right to bring up. But my wife is greatly worried\\r\\nabout this plague. I violate no confidence in telling\\r\\nyou there is considerable unease, even on Earth, according\\r\\nto messages I have received. The ship physician believes\\r\\nMrs. Everts may have the plague, but isn\\'t sure\\r\\nof the symptoms. I understand you are quite expert.\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_79\">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>Doc wondered about the physician. Apparently there\\r\\nwas another man who placed his patients above anything\\r\\nelse, though he was probably meticulous about\\r\\nobeying all actual rules. There was no law against listening\\r\\nto a pariah, at least.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"When did she have Selznik\\'s migraine?\" he asked.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"About thirteen years ago. We went through it together,\\r\\nshortly after having our metabolism switched\\r\\nduring the food shortage of \\'88.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc felt carefully at the base of the Captain\\'s skull;\\r\\nthe swelling was there. He asked a few questions, but\\r\\nthere could be no doubt.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Both of you must have it, Captain, though it won\\'t\\r\\nmature for another year. I\\'m sorry.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"There\\'s no hope, then?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc studied the man. But Everts wasn\\'t the sort to\\r\\ndicker even for his life. \"Nothing that I\\'ve found, Captain.\\r\\nI have a clue, but I\\'m still working on it. Perhaps\\r\\nif I could leave a few notes for your physician\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It was Everts\\' turn to shake his head. \"I\\'m sorry, Dr.\\r\\nFeldman. I have orders to burn out your cabin when\\r\\nyou leave. But thank you.\" He got to his feet and left\\r\\nas quietly and erectly as he had entered.</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc tore up his notes bitterly. He paced his cabin\\r\\nslowly, reading out the hours while his eyes lingered on\\r\\nthe little bottle of cultures. At times the fear grew in\\r\\nhim, but he mastered it. There was half an hour left\\r\\nwhen he began opening the little bottles and making his\\r\\nfilms.</p>\\r\\n<p>He was still not finished when steps echoed down\\r\\nthe hall, but he was reasonably sure of his results. The\\r\\nbug could not grow in Earth-normal tissue.</p>\\r\\n<p>Three men entered the room. One of them, dressed\\r\\nin a spacesuit, held out another suit to him. The other<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_80\">[Pg 80]</a></span>\\r\\ntwo began gathering up everything in the cabin and\\r\\nstowing it neatly into a sack designed to protect freight\\r\\nfor a limited time in a vacuum.</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc forced his hands to steadiness with foolish pride\\r\\nand began climbing into the suit. He reached for the\\r\\nhelmet, but the man shook his head, pointing to the\\r\\noxygen gauge. There would be exactly one hour\\'s supply\\r\\nof oxygen when he was thrown out and it still\\r\\nlacked five minutes of the deadline.</p>\\r\\n<p>They marched him down the hallway, to meet Everts\\r\\ncoming toward them. There were still three minutes\\r\\nleft when they reached the airlock, with its inner door\\r\\nalready open. The spacesuited man climbed into it and\\r\\nbegan strapping down so that the rush of air would not\\r\\nsweep him outward when the other seal was released.</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc had saved one bracky weed. Now he raised it\\r\\nto his lips, fumbling for a light.</p>\\r\\n<p>Everts stepped forward and flipped a lighter. Doc inhaled\\r\\ndeeply. Fear was thick in every muscle, and he\\r\\nneeded the smoke desperately. Then he caught himself.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Better change your metabolism back to Earth-normal,\\r\\nCaptain Everts,\" he said, and his voice was so normal\\r\\nthat he hardly recognized it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Everts\\' eyes widened briefly. The man bowed faintly.\\r\\n\"Thank you, Dr. Feldman.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It was ridiculous, impossible, and yet there was a curious\\r\\nrelief at the formality of it. It was like something\\r\\nfrom a play, too unreal to affect his life.</p>\\r\\n<p>Everts nodded to the man holding the helmet. Doc\\r\\ndropped his bracky weed and felt the helmet snap\\r\\ndown. A hiss of oxygen reached him and the suit ballooned\\r\\nout. There was no gravity; the two men handed\\r\\nhim up easily to the one in the airlock while the inner\\r\\nseal began to close.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_81\">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>There was still ten seconds to go, according to the\\r\\nbig chronometer that had been installed in the lock. The\\r\\nspaceman used it in tying the sack of possessions firmly\\r\\nto Doc\\'s suit.</p>\\r\\n<p>A red light went on. The man caught Doc and held\\r\\nhim against the outer seal. The red light blinked. Four\\r\\nseconds ... three ... two....</p>\\r\\n<p>There was a sudden heavy thudding sound, and the\\r\\n<i>Iroquois</i> seemed to jerk sideways slightly. The spaceman\\'s\\r\\nface swung around in surprise.</p>\\r\\n<p>The red light blinked and stayed on. Zero!</p>\\r\\n<p>The outer seal snapped open and the spaceman\\r\\nheaved. Air exploded outwards, and Doc went\\r\\nwith it. He was alone in space, gliding away from the\\r\\nship, with oxygen hissing softly through the valve and\\r\\nticking away his life.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_82\">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"XI\"></a>XI</h2>\\r\\n<h3>Convert</h3>\\r\\n<p>Feldman fought for control of himself, forced himself\\r\\nto think, to hold onto his sanity. It was sheer stupidity,\\r\\nsince nothing could have been more merciful than\\r\\nto lose this reality. But the will to be himself was\\r\\nstronger than logic. And bit by bit, he forced the fear\\r\\nand horror away from him until he could examine his\\r\\nsituation.</p>\\r\\n<p>He was spinning slowly, so that stars ahead of him\\r\\nseemed to crawl across his view. The ship was retreating\\r\\nfrom him already hundreds of yards away. Mars\\r\\nwas a shrunken pill far away.</p>\\r\\n<p>Then something blinked to one side. He turned his\\r\\nhead to stare.</p>\\r\\n<p>A little ship was less than three hundred yards away.\\r\\nHe recognized it as a life raft. Now his spin brought\\r\\nhim around to face it, and he saw it was parallelling\\r\\nhis course. The ejection of the life raft must have\\r\\ncaused the thump he\\'d heard before he was cast adrift.</p>\\r\\n<p>It meant someone was trying to save him. It meant\\r\\n<i>life</i>!</p>\\r\\n<p>He flailed his arms and beat his legs together, senselessly\\r\\ntrying to force himself closer, while trying to\\r\\nguess who could have taken the chance. No one he\\r\\ncould think of could have booked passage on the <i>Iroquois</i>.\\r\\nThere wasn\\'t that much free money in the villages.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_83\">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>Something flashed a hot blue, and the little ship leaped\\r\\nforward. Whoever was handling it knew nothing about\\r\\npiloting. It picked up too much speed at too great an\\r\\nangle.</p>\\r\\n<p>Again blue spurts came, but this time matters were\\r\\neven worse. Then there was a long wait before a third\\r\\ntry was made. He estimated the course. It would miss\\r\\nhim by a good hundred feet, but it was probably the best\\r\\nthe amateur pilot could do. The ship drifted closer, but\\r\\nto one side. It would soon pass him completely.</p>\\r\\n<p>A spacesuited figure suddenly appeared in the tiny\\r\\nairlock, holding a coil of rope. The rope shot out, well\\r\\nthrown. But it was too short. It would pass within ten\\r\\nfeet\\xe2\\x80\\x94and might as well have been ten miles for all the\\r\\ngood it would do him.</p>\\r\\n<p>Every film he had seen on space seemed to form a\\r\\nmad jumble in his mind, but he seized on the first idea\\r\\nhe could remember. He inhaled deeply and yanked the\\r\\noxygen tank free. An automatic seal on the suit cut off\\r\\nthe connection. He aimed the hissing bottle, fumbling\\r\\nfor the manual valve.</p>\\r\\n<p>It almost worked. It kicked him toward the rope\\r\\nslightly, but most of the energy was wasted in setting\\r\\nhim into a wilder spin. He blinked, trying to spot the\\r\\nrope. It was within five feet now.</p>\\r\\n<p>Again he waited, until he seemed to be in position.\\r\\nThis time he threw the bottle away from it. It added\\r\\nspin to his vertical axis, but the rope came into view\\r\\nwithin arm\\'s reach.</p>\\r\\n<p>He grasped it, just as his lungs seemed about to burst.\\r\\nHe couldn\\'t hold on long enough to tie the rope....</p>\\r\\n<p>His lungs gave up suddenly, collapsing and then sucking\\r\\nin greedily. Clean air rushed in, letting his head<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_84\">[Pg 84]</a></span>\\r\\nclear. He\\'d forgotten that the inflated suit held enough\\r\\noxygen for several minutes.</p>\\r\\n<p>His body struck the edge of the airlock and a hand\\r\\njerked him inside. The outer seal was slammed shut and\\r\\nlocked, and there was a hiss of air entering.</p>\\r\\n<p>He threw back his helmet just as Chris Ryan jerked\\r\\nhers off.</p>\\r\\n<p>Her voice shook almost hysterically. \"Thank God.\\r\\nDan, I almost gave up!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I liked the air out there better,\" he told her bitterly.\\r\\n\"If you\\'ll open the lock again, I\\'ll leave. Or am I supposed\\r\\nto believe this is rescue and that you came along\\r\\njust to save me?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I came along to see you killed, as you know very\\r\\nwell. Saving you wasn\\'t in my orders.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He grunted and reached for the handle that would\\r\\nrelease the outer lock. \"Better get back inside if you\\r\\ndon\\'t want to blow out with me.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It\\'s up to you, Dan,\" she told him, and there was\\r\\nall the sincerity in the world in her blue eyes. \"I\\'m on\\r\\nyour side now.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He began counting on his fingers. \"Let\\'s see. The\\r\\nspare battery, the delay in arresting me, the choice of\\r\\nMatthews\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It was all true.\" Anger began to grow in her eyes.\\r\\n\"Dan Feldman, you get inside this raft! If you don\\'t\\r\\ncare about me, you might consider the people dying of\\r\\nthe plague who need you!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She\\'d played her trump, and it took the round. He\\r\\nfollowed her.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"All right,\" he said grudgingly. \"Spill your story.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She held out a copy of a space radiogram, addressed\\r\\nto Mrs. D. E.

I can see a lot of things.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You\\'ve got me beat then,\" he said. \"I can\\'t see how\\r\\nsuch a reformed young noblewoman calmly walked\\r\\nover and stole a life raft. I can\\'t see how your brilliant\\r\\nmind concocted this whole scheme in almost no time.\\r\\nAnd to be honest, I can\\'t even see why Medical Lobby\\r\\ndecided to save me at the last minute and sent you to\\r\\ndo the job.

The pilot\\'s farewell, addressing\\r\\nhim as Dr. Feldman, had been too low for her to hear,\\r\\nbut it was something that fitted her story. It was probably\\r\\na deliberate clue to give him hope, to assure him\\r\\nthe villages were still trying. It shook his confidence.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And your motive\\xe2\\x80\\x94your real motive?\" he insisted.</p>\\r\\n<p>She swore at him, then began ripping off the spacesuit.\\r\\nShe turned her back, pulling a thin blouse down\\r\\nfrom her neck. He stared, then reached out to touch\\r\\nthe lump there.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"So you\\'ve had Selznik\\'s migraine and know you\\'re\\r\\ncarrying plague. And you\\'ve decided your precious\\r\\nLobby won\\'t save you?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She dropped her eyes, then raised them to meet his\\r\\ndefiantly. \"I\\'m not just scared and selfish.

It might work out here where there was room\\r\\nto maneuver and nothing to hit. But trying to make a\\r\\nlanding was going to be different.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Dan?\" she repeated.</p>\\r\\n<p>He shrugged. \"I don\\'t know. They\\'ve started research\\r\\ntoo late and they\\'ll be under so much pressure\\r\\nthat the real brains won\\'t have a chance. The topsecret\\r\\nstuff looks bad for research. Maybe there\\'s a cure. It\\r\\nworks in culture bottles, but it may fail in person. When\\r\\nI\\'m convinced I\\'m safe with you, I may tell you about\\r\\nit.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh.\" Her voice was low. Then she sighed. \"I sup<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_87\">[Pg 87]</a></span>pose\\r\\nI can understand why you hate me, Dan.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I don\\'t hate you. I\\'m too mixed up. Tomorrow\\r\\nmaybe, but not now. Shut up and let me see if I can\\r\\nfigure out how to land this thing.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He found that the fuel tanks were nearly full, but\\r\\nthat still didn\\'t leave much margin. Mars must have been\\r\\nnotified by Everts and be ready to pick the raft up. He\\r\\nhad to reach the wastelands away from any of the shuttle\\r\\nports. They had no aspirators, however, and they\\r\\ncouldn\\'t cover much territory in the spacesuits they\\r\\nwould have to use. It meant he\\'d have to land close to\\r\\na village where he was known.</p>\\r\\n<p>He jockeyed the ship around by trial and error,\\r\\nstudying the manual that was lying prominently on the\\r\\ncontrol panel. According to the booklet, the ship was\\r\\nsimple to operate. It was self-leveling in an atmosphere,\\r\\nand automatic flare computers were supposed to make\\r\\nit possible for an amateur to judge the rate of descent\\r\\nnear the surface. It looked reassuring\\xe2\\x80\\x94and was probably\\r\\nwritten with that in mind.</p>\\r\\n<p>Finally he reached for the control, hoping he\\'d figured\\r\\nhis landing orbit reasonably well by simple logic.\\r\\nHe smoothed it out in the following hours as he\\r\\nwatched the markings on Mars. When they were near\\r\\nturnover point, he began cranking the little gyroscope\\r\\nto swing the ship. It saved fuel to turn without power,\\r\\nand he wasn\\'t sure he could have turned accurately by\\r\\nblasting.</p>\\r\\n<p>He was gaining some proficiency, however, he felt.\\r\\nBut now he had to waste fuel and ruin his orbit again.\\r\\nThere was no way to practice maneuvering without actually\\r\\ndoing so.</p>\\r\\n<p>In the end, he compromised, leaving a small margin\\r\\nfor a bad landing that would require a second attempt,<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_88\">[Pg 88]</a></span>\\r\\nbut with less practice than he wanted.</p>\\r\\n<p>He had located Jake\\'s village through the little telescope\\r\\nwhen he finally reached for the main blast control.\\r\\nThe thin haze of Mars\\' atmosphere came rushing\\r\\nup, while the blast lashed out. Then they were in the\\r\\nouter fringes of the sky and the blast was beginning to\\r\\nshow a corona that ruined visibility.</p>\\r\\n<p>He turned to the flare computer and back to what\\r\\nhe could see through the quartz viewport. He was going\\r\\nto land about half a mile from the village, as nearly\\r\\nas he could judge.</p>\\r\\n<p>The computer seemed to work as it should. The\\r\\nspeed was within acceptable limits. He gave up trying\\r\\nto see the ground and was forced to trust the machinery\\r\\ndesigned for amateur pilots. The flare bloomed, and\\r\\nhe yanked down on the little lever.</p>\\r\\n<p>It could have been worse. They hit the ground,\\r\\nbounced twice, and turned over. The ship was a mess\\r\\nwhen Feldman freed himself from the elastic straps of\\r\\nthe seat. Chris had shrieked as they hit, but she was unbuckling\\r\\nherself now.</p>\\r\\n<p>He threw her her spacesuit and one of the emergency\\r\\nbottles of oxygen from the rack. \"Hurry up with\\r\\nthat. We\\'ve sprung a leak and the pressure\\'s dropping.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They were halfway to the village when a dozen tractors\\r\\ncame racing up and Jake piled out of the lead one\\r\\nto drag the two in with him.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Heard about it from the broadcasts and figured you\\r\\nmight land around here. Good to see you, Doc.\" He\\r\\nstarted the tractor off at full speed, back to the wastelands,\\r\\nwhile Doc stared at the armed men who were\\r\\nriding the tractors.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake caught his look and nodded. \"You\\'re in enemy\\r\\nterritory, Doc. There\\'s a war going on!\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_89\">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"XII\"></a>XII</h2>\\r\\n<h3>War</h3>\\r\\n<p>Sometimes it seemed to Doc that war was nothing\\r\\nbut an endurance race to see how many times they\\r\\ncould run before they were bombed. He was just beginning\\r\\nto drop off to sleep after a long trip for the\\r\\nsixth consecutive day when the little alarm shrilled. He\\r\\nsighed and shook Chris awake.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Again?\" she protested. But she got up and began\\r\\nhelping him pack.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake came in, his eyes weary, pulling on the old\\r\\njacket with the big star on its sleeve. Doc hadn\\'t been\\r\\ntoo surprised to learn that Jake was the actual leader of\\r\\nthe rebels. \"Shuttles spotted taking off this way. And I\\r\\nstill can\\'t find where the leak is. They haven\\'t missed\\r\\nour location once this week. Here, give me that.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He took the electron mike that had been among Doc\\'s\\'\\r\\npossessions, but Chris recaptured it. \"I can manage,\"\\r\\nshe told him, and headed out for the tractor where Lou\\r\\nwas waiting.</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc scowled after her. He and Jake had been watching\\r\\nher. She was too useful to Doc\\'s research to be\\r\\nturned away, but they didn\\'t trust her yet. So far, however,\\r\\nthey had found nothing wrong with her conduct.\\r\\nStill....</p>\\r\\n<p>He swung suddenly into Jake\\'s tractor. \"Just remembered\\r\\nsomething. How\\'d they find me that time I\\r\\nstopped in the tractor to use the mike? I was pretty<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_90\">[Pg 90]</a></span>\\r\\nwell hidden, and no tracks last in the sand long enough\\r\\nfor them to have followed. But they were there when\\r\\nI came to. Somehow, they must have put a radio tracer\\r\\non me.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake waited while they lighted up, his eyes suddenly\\r\\nbright. \"You mean something you got from her house\\r\\nwas bugged? It figures.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"And I\\'ve still got all the stuff. Now they find wherever\\r\\nwe set up headquarters, though they\\'ve always\\r\\nmanaged to miss my laboratory, even when they\\'ve hit\\r\\nthe troops around us. Jake, I think it\\'s the microscope.\"\\r\\nDoc managed to push enough junk off one of the seats\\r\\nto make a cramped bed, and stretched out. \"Sure, we\\r\\nfigured they sent her because they want to keep tabs\\r\\non what I discover. They\\'ve finally gotten scared of the\\r\\nplague, and she\\'s the perfect Judas goat. But they have\\r\\nto have some way to get in touch with her. I\\'ll bet\\r\\nthere\\'s a tracer in the mike and a switch so she can\\r\\nmodulate it or key it to send out Morse.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yeah,\" Jake nodded. \"Well, she does her own dirty\\r\\nwork. I might get to like her if she was on our side.\\r\\nOkay, Doc. If they\\'ve put things into the mike, I\\'ve got\\r\\na boy who\\'ll find and fix it so she won\\'t guess it\\'s been\\r\\ntouched.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc relaxed. For the moment, there would be no\\r\\npower in the instrument, nor any excuse for her to use\\r\\nit. But she must have handled some secret arrangement\\r\\nduring the work periods. She used the mike more than\\r\\nhe did. The switch could be camouflaged easily enough.\\r\\nIf anyone detected the signal, they\\'d probably only\\r\\nthink it was some leak in the electrical circuit.</p>\\r\\n<p>Far away, the shuttle rockets had appeared as tiny\\r\\ndots in the sky. They were standing on their tails a second\\r\\nlater, just off the ground, letting the full force of<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_91\">[Pg 91]</a></span>\\r\\ntheir blasts bake the area where headquarters had been.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake watched grimly, driving by something close to\\r\\ninstinct. Then he looked back. \"Know anything about\\r\\na Dr. Harkness?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Not much, except that he protested sealing off the\\r\\nvillages. Why?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"He and five other doctors were picked up, trying to\\r\\nget through to us. Claimed they wanted to give us medical\\r\\nhelp. We can use them, God knows. I guess I\\'ll\\r\\nhave to chance it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They stopped at a halfway village and hid the tractors\\r\\nbefore looking for a place to rest. Doc found Chris\\r\\ncurled up asleep against the microscope. He had a hard\\r\\ntime getting her to leave it in the tractor, but she was\\r\\ntoo genuinely tired to put up any real argument.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake reported in the morning before they set out\\r\\nagain. \"You were right, Doc. It was a nice job of work.\\r\\nMust have taken the best guys in Southport to hide the\\r\\ncircuit so well. But it\\'s safe now. It just makes a kind\\r\\nof meaningless static nobody can trace. Maybe we can\\r\\nget you a permanent lab now.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc debated again having Chris left behind and decided\\r\\nagainst it. The Lobby was determined to let him\\r\\nfind a cure for them if he could. That meant Chris\\r\\nwould work herself to exhaustion trying to help. Let\\r\\nher think she was doing it for the Lobby! It was time\\r\\nshe was on the receiving end of a double cross.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It\\'s a stinking way to run a war,\" he decided.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake chuckled without much humor. \"It\\'s the war\\r\\nyou wanted, remember? They forced our hand, but it\\r\\nhad to come sometime. Right now the Lobby\\'s fighting\\r\\nto get their hands on your work before we can use it;\\r\\nthey\\'re just using holding tactics, which helps our side.\\r\\nAnd we\\'re hoping you get the cure so we can win.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_92\">[Pg 92]</a></span>\\r\\nWith that, maybe we\\'ll whip them.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It was a crazy war, with each side killing more of its\\r\\nown men than of the enemy. The runners were increasing,\\r\\nand Jake\\'s army was learning to shoot the poor\\r\\ndevils mercifully and go on. They knew, at least, that\\r\\nthere was no current danger of infection. In the Lobby\\r\\ntowns, more were dying of panic in their efforts to escape\\r\\nthe runners.</p>\\r\\n<p>Desert towns had joined the villages, reluctantly but\\r\\ninevitably, to give the rebels nearly three-quarters of\\r\\nthe total population. But the Lobby forces and the few\\r\\ncities held most of the real fighting equipment and they\\r\\nwere ready to wait until Earth could send out unmanned\\r\\nrockets, loaded with atomics, which could cut\\r\\nthrough space at ten times normal speed.</p>\\r\\n<p>There were vague lines of battle, but time was the\\r\\nvital factor. The Lobbies waited to steal a cure for the\\r\\nplague and the villages waited until they could announce\\r\\nit and demand surrender as its price.</p>\\r\\n<p>It looked as if both sides were doomed to disappointment,\\r\\nhowever. He and Chris had put in every spare\\r\\nminute between moving and the minimum of sleep in\\r\\nsearching for something that would check the disease.\\r\\nIt couldn\\'t grow in an Earth-normal body, but it didn\\'t\\r\\ndie, either. And there wasn\\'t enough normal food available\\r\\nto permit the switch-over for more than a handful\\r\\nof people. Even Earth was out of luck, since eighty percent\\r\\nof her population ate synthetics. There were ways\\r\\nto synthesize Earth-normal food, but they were still\\r\\nhopelessly inefficient.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake had ordered one of the villages to rebuild their\\r\\nplant for such a purpose, while another was producing\\r\\nthe enzyme that would permit switching. But it looked\\r\\nhopeless for more than a few of the most valuable men.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_93\">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"No progress?\" Jake asked for the hundredth time.</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc grinned wryly. \"A lot, but no help. We\\'ve found\\r\\na fine accelerator for the bug. We can speed up its incubation\\r\\nor even make someone already infected catch\\r\\nit all over again. But we can\\'t slow it down or stop it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The new laboratory was still being fitted when they\\r\\narrived. It had been dug into one of the few real cliffs\\r\\nin this section of Mars. The power plant had been installed,\\r\\ncomplete with a steam plant that would operate\\r\\noff sunlight in the daytime through a series of heat\\r\\nvalves that took in a lot of warm air and produced\\r\\nsmaller amounts hot enough to boil water.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I\\'ll see you whenever I can,\" Jake said. \"But mostly,\\r\\nyou\\'re going to be somewhat isolated so they won\\'t\\r\\ntrace you. Let them think they goofed with the shuttles\\r\\nand hit you and Chris. Anything you need?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Guinea pigs,\" Doc told him sarcastically. It was\\r\\nmeant as a joke, though a highly bitter one. Jake\\r\\nnodded and left them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc opened the cots as Chris came in, not bothering\\r\\nto unpack the equipment. \"Hit the sack, Chris,\" he told\\r\\nher.</p>\\r\\n<p>She looked at him doubtfully. \"You almost said that\\r\\nthe way you\\'d address a human being, Dan. You\\'re\\r\\nslipping. One of these days you\\'ll like me again.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Maybe.\" He was too tired to argue. \"I doubt it,\\r\\nthough. Forget it and get some sleep.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She watched him silently until he got up to turn out\\r\\nthe light. Then she sighed heavily. \"Dan?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Yeah?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I never got a divorce. The publicity would have\\r\\nbeen bad. But anyway, we\\'re still married.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"That\\'s nice.\" He swung to face her briefly. \"And<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_94\">[Pg 94]</a></span>\\r\\nthey found the radio in the microscope. Better get to\\r\\nsleep, Chris.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Oh.\" It was a quiet exclamation, barely audible.\\r\\nThere was a sound that might have been a sniffle if it\\r\\nhad come from anyone else. Then she rolled over. \"All\\r\\nright, Dan. I still want to help you.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He cursed himself for a stupid fool for telling her.\\r\\nFatigue was ruining what judgment he had. From now\\r\\non, he\\'d have to watch her every minute. Or had she\\r\\nreally seen the value of the research by now? She\\r\\nwasn\\'t a fool. It should have registered on even her\\r\\nstubborn mind. But he was too sleepy to think about it.</p>\\r\\n<p>She had breakfast ready in the morning. She made\\r\\nno comment on what had been said during the night.\\r\\nInstead, she began discussing a way to keep one of the\\r\\norganic antibiotics from splitting into simpler compounds\\r\\nwhen they tried to switch it over to Mars-normal.\\r\\nThey were both hopelessly bad chemists and biologists,\\r\\nbut there was no one else to do the work.</p>\\r\\n<p>Chris worked harder than ever during the day.</p>\\r\\n<p>Just after sundown, Jake came in with a heavy box.\\r\\nHe dropped it onto the floor. \"Mice!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc ripped off the cover, exposing fine screening.\\r\\nThere were at least six dozen mice inside!</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Harkness found them,\" Jake explained. \"A hormone\\r\\nextraction plant used them for testing some of the products.\\r\\nHad them sent by regular shipments from Earth.\\r\\nGetting them cost a couple of men, but Harkness claims\\r\\nit\\'s worth it. He\\'s a good man on a raid. Here!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He\\'d gone to the doorway again and came back with\\r\\nanother box, this one crammed with bottles and boxes.\\r\\n\"They had quite a laboratory, and Harkness picked out\\r\\nwhatever he thought you could use.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Chris and Doc were going through it. The labels<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_95\">[Pg 95]</a></span>\\r\\nwere engineering ones, but the chemical formulae were\\r\\nidentification enough. There were dozens of chemicals\\r\\nthey hadn\\'t hoped to get.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Anything else?\" Doc finally asked as they began\\r\\narranging the supplies.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"More runners. A lot more. We\\'re still holding things\\r\\ndown, but it\\'s reaching a limit. Panic will start in the\\r\\ncamps if this keeps on. But that\\'s my worry. You stick\\r\\nto yours.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Several of the new chemicals showed promise in the\\r\\ntubes. But two of them proved fatal to the mice and\\r\\nthe others were completely innocuous in the little animal\\'s\\r\\nbodies, both to mouse and to germ. The plague\\r\\nwas much hardier in contact with living cells than in\\r\\nthe artificial environment of the culture jars.</p>\\r\\n<p>They lost seven mice in two days, but that seemed\\r\\nunimportant; the females were already living up to their\\r\\nreputations, nearly all pregnant. Doc didn\\'t know the\\r\\ngestation period, but he remembered that it was short.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Funny they all started at the same time,\" he commented.\\r\\n\"Must have been shipped out separately or\\r\\nelse been kept apart while they were switched over to\\r\\nMars-normal. Something interrupted their habits, anyhow.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>A few nights later they learned what it was. There\\r\\nwas a horrible squealing that woke him out of the\\r\\ndepths of his sleep. Chris was already at the light\\r\\nswitch. As light came on, they turned to the mouse\\r\\nbox.</p>\\r\\n<p>All the animals were charging about in their limited\\r\\nspace, their little legs driving madly and their mouths\\r\\nopen. What they lacked in size they made up in numbers,\\r\\nand the din was terrific.</p>\\r\\n<p>But it didn\\'t last. One by one, the mice began drop<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_96\">[Pg 96]</a></span>ping\\r\\nto the floor of the cage. In fifteen minutes, they\\r\\nwere all dead!</p>\\r\\n<p>It was obviously the plague, contracted after having\\r\\ntheir metabolism switched. Women were sterile for\\r\\nsome time after Selznik\\'s migraine struck, and the same\\r\\nmust have been true of the mice. They must have contracted\\r\\nthe plague at about the same time and reached\\r\\nfertility together. Somehow, the plague incubation period\\r\\nhad been shortened to fit their life span; the disease\\r\\nwas nothing if not adaptive.</p>\\r\\n<p>Chris prepared a slide in dull silence. The familiar\\r\\ncell was there when Doc looked through the microscope.\\r\\nHe picked up one of the little creatures and cut\\r\\nit open, removing one of the foetuses.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Make a film of that,\" he suggested.</p>\\r\\n<p>She worked rapidly, scraping out the almost microscopic\\r\\nbrain, dissolving out the fatty substance, and\\r\\ntransferring the result to a film. This time, even at full\\r\\nmagnification, there was no sign of the filaments that\\r\\nwere always present in diseased flesh. The results were\\r\\nthe same for the other samples they made.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Something about the very young animal or a secretion\\r\\nfrom the mother\\'s organs keeps the bug from\\r\\nworking.\" Doc reached for a bracky weed and accepted\\r\\na light from Chris without thinking of it. \"Every kid\\r\\nI\\'ve heard about contracted the plague between the second\\r\\nand third year. None are born with it, none get it\\r\\nearlier. I\\'ve suspected this, but now here\\'s confirmation.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Chris began preparing specimens, while Doc got\\r\\nbusy with tubes of the culture. They\\'d have to test\\r\\nvarious fluids from the tiny bodies, but there were\\r\\nenough cultures prepared. Then, if the substance only\\r\\ninhibited growth, there would be a long, slow test; if<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_97\">[Pg 97]</a></span>\\r\\nit killed the bugs, they might know more quickly.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake came in before the final tests, but waited on\\r\\nthem. Doc was studying a film in the microscope. He\\r\\nsuddenly motioned excitedly for Chris.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"See the filaments? They\\'re completely disintegrated.\\r\\nAnd there\\'s one of the big cells broken open. We\\'ve\\r\\ngot it! It\\'s in the blood of the foetus. And it must be\\r\\nin the blood of newborn children, too!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake looked at the slide, but his face was doubtful.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Maybe you\\'ve got something, Doc. I hope so. And\\r\\nI hope you can use it.\" He shook his head wearily.\\r\\n\"We need good news right now. A couple of big rockets\\r\\njust reached the station and they\\'ve been sending\\r\\nshuttles back and forth a mile a minute. Nobody can\\r\\nfigure how they got here so fast or what they\\'re for.\\r\\nBut it doesn\\'t look good for us!\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_98\">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"XIII\"></a>XIII</h2>\\r\\n<h3>Susceptibility</h3>\\r\\n<p>Doc could feel the tension in the village where GHQ\\r\\nwas temporarily located long before they were close\\r\\nenough for details to register. The people were gathered\\r\\nin clusters, staring at the sky where the station\\r\\nmust be. A few were pacing up and down, gesticulating\\r\\nwith tight sweeps of their arms.</p>\\r\\n<p>One woman suddenly went into even more violent\\r\\naction. She leaped into the air and then took off at a\\r\\nrapid trot, then a run. Her hands were tearing at her\\r\\nclothes and her mouth seemed to be working violently.\\r\\nShe was halfway to the top of the nearest dune before\\r\\na rifle cracked. She dropped, to twitch once and lie\\r\\nstill.</p>\\r\\n<p>Almost with her death, another figure leaped from\\r\\none of the houses, his face bare of the necessary aspirator.\\r\\nHe took off at a violent run, but he was falling\\r\\nfrom lack of air before the bullet ended his struggles.</p>\\r\\n<p>The people suddenly began to move apart, as if trying\\r\\nto get away from each other. For weeks they had\\r\\nfaced the horror with courage; now it was finally too\\r\\nmuch for them.</p>\\r\\n<p>Tension mounted as no news came from the cities.\\r\\nDoc noticed that it seemed to aggravate or speed up\\r\\nthe disease. He saw three men shot in the next half-hour.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_99\">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>He was trying to calm them with word of a possible\\r\\ncure for the plague, but their reactions were as curiously\\r\\ndull as those of Jake had been. As he spoke, they\\r\\nfaced him with set expressions. At his mention of the\\r\\nneed for the blood of young children, they turned from\\r\\nhim, sullenly silent.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake came over, nodding unhappily. \"It\\'s what I was\\r\\nafraid might happen, Doc. George Lynn! Tell Doc\\r\\nwhat\\'s wrong.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Lynn was reluctant, but he finally stumbled out his\\r\\nexplanation. \"It ain\\'t like you, Doc. Comes from that\\r\\nLobby woman you got. It\\'s her dirty idea. We\\'ve seen\\r\\nthe Lobby doctors cutting open our kids, poisoning\\r\\ntheir blood, and bleeding them dry. That ain\\'t gonna\\r\\nhappen again, Doc. You tell her it ain\\'t!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc swore as he realized their ignorance. An unexplained\\r\\nvaccination looked like poisoning of the blood.\\r\\nBut he couldn\\'t understand the bleeding part until Jake\\r\\nfilled him in.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Northport infant\\'s wing. Each department has its\\r\\nown blood bank and donation is compulsory. Southport\\r\\nstarted it a couple months ago, too.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The long arm of the Lobby had reached out again.\\r\\nNow if he ever got them to try the treatment, it would\\r\\nbe only after long sessions of preparing them with the\\r\\nfacts, and there was hardly enough time for the crucial\\r\\nwork!</p>\\r\\n<p>By afternoon, Judge Ben Wilson reached them. His\\r\\nvoice shook with fatigue as he climbed up to address\\r\\nthe crowd through a power megaphone. \"Southport\\'s\\r\\ngoing crazy.\" He had to pause for breath between each\\r\\nsentence. \"Earth\\'s pulling back all the important people.\\r\\nThey\\'re packing them into the ships. They\\'re leaving\\r\\nonly colonials with no Earth rights. Those ships left<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_100\">[Pg 100]</a></span>\\r\\nwhen they decided the plague was coming from here.\\r\\nThey won\\'t let anybody back until the plague is licked.\\r\\nThere won\\'t be an Earth technician on Mars tomorrow.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No bombs?\" someone called.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No bombs. The ships must have started before you\\r\\nrebelled, maybe meant honestly to save their own kind.\\r\\nBut now it\\'s a military action, and don\\'t think it won\\'t\\r\\nmean trouble. The poor devils in the city bet on the\\r\\nwrong horse. Now they can\\'t run their food factories\\r\\nor anything else for long. Not without technicians.\\r\\nThey\\'ve got to whip you now. Up to this time, they\\'ve\\r\\nbeen fighting for the Lobbies. Now they\\'ll fight you\\r\\nfor their own bellies to get your supplies. And they\\'ve\\r\\nstill got shuttle rockets and fuel for them. Now beat it.\\r\\nI gotta confer with Jake.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc started after the judge, but Dr. Harkness caught\\r\\nhis arm and drew him aside. Chris followed.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I\\'ve found another epidemic,\" Harkness told them.\\r\\n\"Over at Marconi. It\\'s kept me on the run all night,\\r\\nand now half the village is down with it. Starts like a\\r\\ncommon cold, runs a fair fever, and the skin breaks out\\r\\nall over with bright red dots....\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He went on describing it. Chris began asking him\\r\\nabout what medical supplies he had brought with him,\\r\\npilfered from Northport hospital. She seemed to know\\r\\nwhat it was, but refused to say until she saw the cases.\\r\\nDoc also preferred to wait. Sometimes things weren\\'t\\r\\nas bad as they seemed, though usually they were worse.</p>\\r\\n<p>Marconi was dead to all outward appearances, with\\r\\nnobody on the streets. It had been a village of great\\r\\nhopes a week before, since this was where they had\\r\\ndecided to experiment with switching the people back\\r\\nto Earth-normal. They\\'d had the best chance of sur<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_101\">[Pg 101]</a></span>vival\\r\\nof anyone on Mars until this came up.</p>\\r\\n<p>Three people lay on the beds in the first house Harkness\\r\\nled them to. The room was darkened, and a man\\r\\nwas stumbling around, trying to tend the others, though\\r\\nthe little spots showed on his skin. He grinned weakly.\\r\\n\"Hi, Doc. I guess we\\'re making a lot of trouble, ain\\'t\\r\\nwe?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Chris gave Doc no chance to answer. \"Just as I\\r\\nthought. Measles! Plain old-fashioned measles.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Figured so,\" the sick man said. \"Like my brother\\r\\nback on Earth.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The others looked doubtful, but Doc reassured them.\\r\\nChris should know; she\\'d worked in a swanky hospital\\r\\nwhere the patients were mostly Earth-normal. Measles\\r\\nwas one of the diseases which was foiled by the metabolism\\r\\nswitch. Well, at least they wouldn\\'t have to be\\r\\nquarantined here.</p>\\r\\n<p>Chris finished treating the family with impersonal efficiency,\\r\\ndiscussing the symptoms loudly with Harkness.\\r\\n\"It\\'s a good thing it isn\\'t serious!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No,\" Harkness answered bitterly. \"Not serious. It\\'s\\r\\nonly killed five children and three adults so far!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It would, here,\" Doc agreed unhappily. He led Chris\\r\\nout of the room on the pretext of washing his hands.\\r\\n\"It\\'s serious enough to force us to abandon the whole\\r\\nidea of going back to Earth-normal. Measles today,\\r\\nsmallpox, tuberculosis, scarlet fever and everything else\\r\\ntomorrow. These people have lived Mars-normal so long\\r\\ntheir natural immunity has been destroyed. On Earth\\r\\nwhere the disease was everywhere, kids used to pick\\r\\nup some immunity with constant exposure, even without\\r\\nwhat might be called a case of the disease. Here,\\r\\nthe blood has no reason to build antibodies. They can\\r\\nbe killed by things people used to laugh at. How the<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_102\">[Pg 102]</a></span>\\r\\ndisease got here, I don\\'t know. But it\\'s here. So we\\'ll\\r\\nhave to give up the idea of switching back to Earth-normal.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He gathered up one of the kits and started toward\\r\\nthe other houses. \"And Lord knows how long it will\\r\\ntake to get the blood for the other treatment, even if\\r\\nit works.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>They worked as a team for a while, with Harkness\\r\\nfrowning as he watched Chris. Finally the young doctor\\r\\nstopped Chris outside the fifth house. \"These are\\r\\nmy patients, Dr. Ryan. I left the Lobby because I didn\\'t\\r\\nbelieve colonials were mere livestock. I still feel the\\r\\nsame. I appreciate your help in diagnosis and methods\\r\\nof treatment. But I can\\'t let you handle my patients\\r\\nthis way.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Dan!\" She swung around with eyes glazing. \"Dan,\\r\\nare you going to stand for that?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I think you\\'d better wait in the tractor, Chris.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He was lucky enough to catch the kit she threw at\\r\\nhim before its precious contents spilled. But it wasn\\'t\\r\\nluck that guided his hand to the back of her skirt hard\\r\\nenough to leave it stinging.</p>\\r\\n<p>Her face froze and she stormed out. A moment later\\r\\nthey heard the tractor start off.</p>\\r\\n<p>But Doc had no time to think of her. He and Harkness\\r\\nsplit up and began covering the streets, house by\\r\\nhouse, while he passed on the word to abandon the metabolism\\r\\nswitch and go back to Mars-normal.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake sent two other doctors to relieve them late in\\r\\nthe evening. Things were somewhat quieter at GHQ\\r\\nas Doc reported the events at Marconi.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Where\\'s Dr. Ryan?\" Jake asked at last.</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc exchanged glances with Harkness. \"She isn\\'t in\\r\\nthe lab?\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_103\">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>\"Wasn\\'t there an hour ago.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc cursed himself for letting her go. With the\\r\\nknowledge that the radio in the mike was disabled,\\r\\nshe\\'d obviously grabbed the first chance to report back.\\r\\nAnd with her had gone news of the only cure they\\r\\nhad found.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake took it as philosophically as he could, though it\\r\\nwas a heavy blow to his hopes. They spent half the\\r\\nnight looking for her tractor, on the chance that she\\r\\nmight have gotten lost or broken down, but there was\\r\\nno sign of it.</p>\\r\\n<p>She was waiting in the laboratory when he returned\\r\\nat dawn. Her face was dirty and her uniform was a\\r\\nmess. But she was smiling. She got up to greet him,\\r\\nholding out two large bottles.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Infant plasma\\xe2\\x80\\x94straight from Southport. And if you\\r\\nthink I had it easy lying my way in and out of the\\r\\nhospital, you\\'re a fool, Dan Feldman. If the man who\\r\\ntook my place there hadn\\'t been a native idiot, I never\\r\\nwould have gotten away with it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The things he had suspected could still be right, he\\r\\nrealized. She could have reported everything to the\\r\\nLobby. It was a better explanation than her vague account\\r\\nof bullying her way in and out. But she\\'d had a\\r\\nrough drive, and he wanted the plasma. Curiously, he\\r\\nwas glad to have her back with him. He reached out a\\r\\nhand for the bottles.</p>\\r\\n<p>She put the bottle on the table and grabbed up a\\r\\nshort-bladed knife. \"Not so fast,\" she cried. Her eyes\\r\\nwere blazing now. \"Dan Feldman, if you touch those\\r\\nbottles until you\\'ve crawled across the floor on your\\r\\nface and apologized for the way you treated me the last\\r\\nfew days, I\\'ll cut your damned heart out.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He shook his head, chuckling at the picture she<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_104\">[Pg 104]</a></span>\\r\\nmade. There were times when he could almost see why\\r\\nhe\\'d married her.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"All right, Chris,\" he gave in. \"I\\'ll be darned if I\\'ll\\r\\ncrawl, but you\\'ve earned an apology.

Then she nodded and began\\r\\nchanging for work.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_105\">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"XIV\"></a>XIV</h2>\\r\\n<h3>Immunity</h3>\\r\\n<p>They worked through the day in what seemed to be\\r\\narmed truce. There was no coffee waiting for him when\\r\\nhe awoke next, as he\\'d come to expect, but he didn\\'t\\r\\ncomment. He went to where she was already working,\\r\\nchecking on the results of the plasma on the cultures.</p>\\r\\n<p>The response had been slower than with the mouse\\r\\nblood, but now the bugs seemed to be dead. The filaments\\r\\nwere destroyed, and there were no signs of the\\r\\nbig cells. It seemed to be a cure, at least in the culture\\r\\nbottles.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We\\'ll need volunteers,\" he decided. \"There should\\r\\nbe animals, but we don\\'t have any. At least this stuff\\r\\nisn\\'t toxic. We need a natural immune and someone infected.\\r\\nTwo of each, so one can be treated and the\\r\\nother used for a control. Makes four. Not enough to\\r\\nbe sure, but it will have to do.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Two,\" Chris corrected. \"You\\'re not infected, I am.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Two others,\" he agreed. \"I\\'ll get them from Jake.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Most of GHQ was out on the street, but Doc found\\r\\nJake inside the big schoolroom where he enjoyed his\\r\\nearly morning bracky and coffee. The chief listened\\r\\nand agreed at once, turning to the others in the room.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Who\\'s had the jumping headache? Okay, Swanee.\\r\\nWho never had it?\" He blinked in surprise as three men\\r\\nnodded out of the eight present. \"I guess you go, Tom.\"<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_106\">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>The two men stood up, tamping out their weeds, and\\r\\nwent out with Doc.</p>\\r\\n<p>Chris had everything set up. They matched coins to\\r\\ndecide who would be treated. Doc noticed that Chris\\r\\nwould get no plasma, while he was scheduled for everything.\\r\\nHe watched her prepare the culture and add the\\r\\naccelerator that would speed development and make\\r\\ncertain he and Tom were infected, then let her inject it.</p>\\r\\n<p>That was all, except for the waiting. To keep conditions\\r\\nmore closely alike, they were to stay there until\\r\\nthe tests were finished, not even eating for fear of upsetting\\r\\nthe conditions. Swanee dug out a pack of worn\\r\\ncards and began to deal while Doc dug out some large\\r\\npills to use as chips.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was an hour later when the pain began. Doc had\\r\\njust won the pot of fifty pills and opened his mouth\\r\\nfor the expected gloating. He yelled as an explosion\\r\\nseemed to go off inside his head. Even closing his\\r\\nmouth was agony.</p>\\r\\n<p>A moment later, Tom began to sweat. It got worse,\\r\\nspreading to the whole area of the back of the head\\r\\nand neck. Doc lay on the cot, envying Chris and Swanee\\r\\nwho had already been infected naturally. He longed\\r\\ndesperately for bracky, and had to keep reminding himself\\r\\nthat no drugs must upset the tests. It was the longest\\r\\nday he had ever spent, and he began to doubt that\\r\\nhe could get through it. He watched the little clock\\r\\nmove from one minute to nine over to half a minute\\r\\nand hung breathless until it hit the nine. There was\\r\\nno question about whether the infection had taken.\\r\\nNow they could dull the agony.</p>\\r\\n<p>Chris had the anodyne tablets already dissolved in\\r\\nwater, and Swanee was passing out three lighted bracky\\r\\nweeds. It took a few minutes for the relief of the<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_107\">[Pg 107]</a></span>\\r\\nanodyne, and even that couldn\\'t kill all the pain. But\\r\\nit didn\\'t matter by comparison. He sucked the weed,\\r\\nmashed it out and began dealing the cards again.</p>\\r\\n<p>They had a plentiful supply of the anodyne and used\\r\\nit liberally during the night. The test was a speeded-up\\r\\nsimulation of the natural course of the disease, where\\r\\npainkiller would take time to get for most people here,\\r\\nbut would then be used generously.</p>\\r\\n<p>Precisely at nine in the morning, Chris began to inject\\r\\nSwanee and Doc with plasma.</p>\\r\\n<p>Now there was no thought of cards. They waited,\\r\\ntrying to talk, but with most of their attention on the\\r\\nclock. Doc had estimated that an hour should be enough\\r\\nto show results, but it was hard to remember that an\\r\\nhour was the guess as to the minimum time.</p>\\r\\n<p>He winced as Chris took a tiny bit of flesh from his\\r\\nneck. She went to the other men, and then submitted\\r\\nto his work on herself. Then she began preparing the\\r\\nslides.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Feldman,\" she read the name of the slide as she inserted\\r\\nit into the microscope. Then her breath caught\\r\\nsharply. \"Only dead cells!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>It was the same for Swanee and Tom. Each had to\\r\\nlook at his own slide and have it explained before the\\r\\nresults could be believed. But at last Chris bent over\\r\\nher own slide. A minute later she glanced up, nodding.\\r\\n\"What it should be. It checks.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Tom whooped and went out the door to notify Jake.\\r\\nThere was only plasma for some two hundred injections,\\r\\nbut that should yield sufficient proof. Once salvation\\r\\nwas offered, there should be no trouble convincing\\r\\nthe people that blood donations from their children\\r\\nwere worthwhile.</p>\\r\\n<p>Later, when the last of the plasma had been used,<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_108\">[Pg 108]</a></span>\\r\\nthey could finally relax. Chris slipped off her smock\\r\\nand dropped onto the cot. A tired smile came onto her\\r\\nlips. \"You\\'re forgiven, Dan,\" she said. A moment later\\r\\nshe was obviously asleep. Doc meant to join her, but\\r\\nit was too much effort. He leaned his head forward\\r\\nonto his arms, vaguely wondering why she was calling\\r\\noff the feud.</p>\\r\\n<p>It was night outside when he awoke, and he was lying\\r\\non the cot, though he still felt cramped and\\r\\nstrained. He stirred, groaning, and finally realized that\\r\\na hand was on his shoulder shaking him. He looked up\\r\\nto see Jake above him. Chris was busy with the coffee\\r\\nmaker.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake slumped onto the cot beside Doc. \"We took\\r\\nSouthport,\" he announced.</p>\\r\\n<p>That knocked the sleep out of Doc\\'s system. \"You\\r\\nwhat?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We took it, lock, stock and barrel. I figured the\\r\\nnews of your cure would put guts into the men, and\\r\\nit did. But we\\'d probably have taken it anyhow. There\\r\\nwasn\\'t anything to fight for there after Earth pulled out\\r\\nand the plague really hit. Wilson mistook last-minute\\r\\npanic for fighting spirit. The poor devils didn\\'t have\\r\\nanything to fight about, once the Lobby stopped goading\\r\\nthem.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc tried to assimilate the news. But once the surprise\\r\\nwas gone, he found it meant very little. Maybe\\r\\nhis revolutionary zeal had cooled, once the Lobby men\\r\\nhad pulled out. \"We\\'ll need a lot more plasma than\\r\\nthere is in Southport,\" he said.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Not so much, maybe,\" Jake denied. \"Doc, three of\\r\\nthe men you injected were shot down as runners. Your\\r\\nplasma\\'s no good.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It takes time to work, Jake. I told you there might<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_109\">[Pg 109]</a></span>\\r\\nbe a case or two that would be too close to the edge.\\r\\nThree is more than I expected; but it\\'s not impossible.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"There was plenty of time. They blew after we got\\r\\nback from Southport.\" Jack dropped his hand on Doc\\'s\\r\\nshoulder, and his face softened. \"Harkness tested every\\r\\nman you injected. He finished half an hour ago. Five\\r\\nshowed dead bugs. The rest of them weren\\'t helped\\r\\nat all.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc fumbled for a weed, trying to think. But his\\r\\nthoughts refused to focus. \"Five!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Five out of two hundred. That\\'s about average. And\\r\\nwhat about Tom? He was jumping around after the\\r\\ntest last night, telling how you\\'d cured him, how he\\'d\\r\\nseen the dead bugs; but he never had the jumping\\r\\nheadache, and you never gave him the plasma! He\\'s got\\r\\ndead bugs, though. Harkness tested him.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc let his realization of his own idiocy sink in until\\r\\nhe could believe it. Jake was right. Tom had never\\r\\nbeen treated, yet Chris had reported dead bugs. They\\'d\\r\\nall been so ready to believe in miracles that no one had\\r\\nbeen able to think straight after the long wait.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"There was a bump on his neck\\xe2\\x80\\x94a small one,\" he\\r\\nsaid slowly. \"Jake, he must have caught it, even if he\\r\\nseemed immune. If he was taking anodyne anyway for\\r\\nsomething\\xe2\\x80\\x94or unconscious\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"He was up in Northport six years ago for a kidney\\r\\noperation,\" Jake admitted doubtfully. \"We had to chip\\r\\nin to pay for it. But you still didn\\'t treat him, and he\\'s\\r\\ncured. Face it, Doc, that plasma is no good inside the\\r\\nbody.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>His hand tightened on Doc\\'s shoulder again. \"We\\'re\\r\\nnot blaming you. We don\\'t judge a man here except by\\r\\nwhat he is. Maybe the stuff helps a little. We\\'ll go on<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_110\">[Pg 110]</a></span>\\r\\nusing it when we get it; tell everybody you were a mite\\r\\noptimistic, so they\\'ll figure it\\'s a gamble, but have a little\\r\\nhope left. And you keep trying. Something cured\\r\\nit in Tom. Now you find out what.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc watched him go out numbly, and turned to\\r\\nChris.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"It can\\'t be right,\" she said shakily. \"You and Swanee\\r\\nwere cured. Maybe it was the accelerator. It had to be\\r\\nsomething.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You didn\\'t have the accelerator,\" he accused.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No, and I\\'ve still got live bugs. I was never supposed\\r\\nto be cured, so I expected to see just what I saw.\\r\\nHow I missed the fact that Tom should have been\\r\\nlike me, I don\\'t know. Damn it, oh, damn it!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He\\'s never seen her cry before, except in fury. But\\r\\nshe mastered it almost at once, shaking tears out of her\\r\\neyes. \"All right. Plasma works in a bottle but not in\\r\\nan adult body. Maybe something works in the body\\r\\nbut not in a bottle.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Maybe. And maybe some people are just naturally\\r\\nimmune after it reaches a certain stage. Maybe we ran\\r\\ninto coincidence.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>But he didn\\'t believe that, any more than she did.\\r\\nThe answer had to be in the room. He\\'d taken a massive\\r\\ndose of the disease and been cured in a few hours.</p>\\r\\n<p>Outside the room, the war went on, drawing toward\\r\\na close. The supposed partial cure was good propaganda,\\r\\nif nothing else, and Jake was widening his territory\\r\\nsteadily. There was only token resistance against\\r\\nhim. He had the Southport shuttles now to cover huge\\r\\nareas in a hurry. But inside the room, the battle was\\r\\nless successful. It wasn\\'t the accelerator. It wasn\\'t the\\r\\ntablets of anodyne. They even tried sweeping the floor\\r\\nand using the dust without results.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_111\">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>Then another test in the room, made with four volunteers\\r\\nJake selected, yielded complete cures after injections\\r\\nwith plain salt water in place of plasma.</p>\\r\\n<p>The plague speeded up again. About four people out\\r\\nof a hundred now seemed to have caught the disease\\r\\nand cured themselves. They accounted for what faith\\r\\nwas left in Doc\\'s plasma and gave some unfounded hope\\r\\nto the others.</p>\\r\\n<p>Northport fell a week later, putting the whole planet\\r\\nin rebel hands.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake returned, wearier than ever. He\\'d proved to be\\r\\none of the natural immunes, but the weight of the\\r\\ncampaign that could only end in a defeat by the plague\\r\\nleft him no room to rejoice in his personal fortune.</p>\\r\\n<p>This time he looked completely defeated. And a moment\\r\\nlater, Doc saw why as Jake flipped a flimsy sheet\\r\\nonto the table. It bore the seals of Space and Medical\\r\\nLobbies.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake pointed upwards. \"The war rockets are there,\\r\\nall right. We knew they\\'d come. Now all they want\\r\\nfor calling them off is our surrender and your cure.\\r\\nIf they don\\'t get both, they\\'ll blow the planet to bits.\\r\\nWe have two days.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The rockets could be seen clearly with binoculars.\\r\\nThere were more than enough to destroy all life on the\\r\\nplanet. Maybe they\\'d be used eventually, anyhow, since\\r\\nthe Lobbies wanted no more rebellion. But with a cure\\r\\nfor the plague, he might have bought them off.</p>\\r\\n<p>Chris stood beside him, looking as if it were a bitter\\r\\npill for her, too. She\\'d risked herself in the hands of\\r\\nthe enemy, had cooperated with him in everything\\r\\nshe\\'d been taught to oppose, and had worked like a dog.\\r\\nNow the Lobbies seemed to forget her as a useless tool.\\r\\nThey were falling back on a raw power play and for<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_112\">[Pg 112]</a></span>getting\\r\\nany earlier schemes.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Maybe they\\'d hold off for a while if I agreed to go\\r\\nto them and share all my ideas, specimens and notes,\"\\r\\nhe said at last. \"Do you think your Lobby would settle\\r\\nfor that, Chris?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I don\\'t know, Dan. I\\'ve stopped thinking their way.\"\\r\\nShe seemed almost apologetic for the admission.</p>\\r\\n<p>He dropped an arm over her shoulder and turned\\r\\nwith her back to the laboratory. \"Okay, then we\\'ve got\\r\\nto find a miracle. We\\'ve got two days ahead of us. At\\r\\nleast we can try.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>But he knew he was lying to himself. There wasn\\'t\\r\\nanything he could think of to try.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_113\">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2><a id=\"XV\"></a>XV</h2>\\r\\n<h3>Decision</h3>\\r\\n<p>Two days was never enough time for a miracle. Doc\\r\\ndecided as he packed his notes into a small bag and\\r\\nput it beside his bundle of personal belongings. He\\r\\nglanced around the room for the last time, and managed\\r\\na grin at Jake\\'s gloomy expression.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Maybe I can bluff them, or maybe they\\'ll string\\r\\nalong for a while,\" he said. \"Anyhow, now that they\\'ve\\r\\nagreed to take me and my notes in place of the cure\\r\\nwe\\'re fresh out of, I\\'ve got to be on that shuttle when\\r\\nit goes back to their men at orbital station.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake nodded. \"I don\\'t like selling friends down the\\r\\nriver, Doc. But it wouldn\\'t do you any more good to\\r\\nblow up with the planet, I reckon. They won\\'t call off\\r\\nthe war rockets when they do get you, of course. But\\r\\nmaybe they won\\'t use them, except as a threat to put\\r\\nthe Lobbies back in, stronger than ever.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He stuck out one of his awkwardly shaped hands,\\r\\nclapped the aspirator over his face and hurried out.\\r\\nDoc picked up his bags and went toward the little tractor\\r\\nwhere Lou was waiting to drive him and Chris back\\r\\ntoward Southport and the shuttle rocket that would be\\r\\nlanding for them. They hadn\\'t mentioned Chris in their\\r\\ndemands, but her father must expect her to return.</p>\\r\\n<p>After they had him, he\\'d be on his own. His best\\r\\ncourse was probably to insist on talking only to Ryan\\r\\nat Medical Lobby, and then being completely honest.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_114\">[Pg 114]</a></span>\\r\\nThe room here would be kept sealed, in case the Lobby\\r\\nwanted to investigate where he had failed. And his notes\\r\\nwere honest, which was something that could usually\\r\\nbe determined. Chris could testify to that, anyhow,\\r\\nsince she\\'d kept a lot of them for him.</p>\\r\\n<p>At best, there would be a chance for some compromise\\r\\nand perhaps some clue for them that might eventually\\r\\nend the plague. They had enough men to work\\r\\non it, and billions in equipment. At worst, he should\\r\\ngain a little time.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Cheer up, Chris,\" he told her as he climbed through\\r\\nthe little airlock. \"Maybe Harkness will turn up the\\r\\ncure before our negotiations break down. He has the\\r\\nwhole of Northport Hospital to play with. They\\r\\nhaven\\'t tried to chase him out of there yet. After all,\\r\\nwe almost found something with no equipment except\\r\\nwild imaginations.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She shook her head as the tractor began moving.\\r\\n\"Shut up! I\\'ve got enough trouble without your coming\\r\\ndown with logorrhea. Don\\'t be a fool.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Why change now?\" he asked her. \"Everything I\\'ve\\r\\ndone has been because I am a fool. I guess my luck\\r\\nlasted longer than I could expect. And I\\'m still fool\\r\\nenough to think that the solution has to turn up eventually.\\r\\nWe know it has to be in that room. Damn it,\\r\\nwe must know it\\xe2\\x80\\x94if we could only think straight now.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She reached over and touched his hand, but made\\r\\nno comment. They had been over that statement of\\r\\ndesperation too many times already. But it kept nagging\\r\\nat him\\xe2\\x80\\x94something in the room, something in the\\r\\nroom! Something so common that nobody noticed it!</p>\\r\\n<p>They passed a crowd chasing down a runner. Something\\r\\nin that room could have saved the unlucky man.\\r\\nIt could have saved Mars, perhaps.<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_115\">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>\\r\\n<p>He growled for the hundredth time, cursing his fatigue-numbed\\r\\nmind. Too little sleep, too much coffee\\r\\nand bracky....</p>\\r\\n<p>He reached for the package of weed, realizing that\\r\\nhe would miss it on Earth, if he ever got there. Like\\r\\neverything here on the planet, he\\'d begun by detesting\\r\\nit and wound up finding it the thing he wanted to\\r\\nkeep forever. He lighted the bracky and sat smoking,\\r\\nwatching Lou drive. When the first was finished, he\\r\\nlighted another from the butt.</p>\\r\\n<p>She put out a hand and took it away. \"Please, Dan.\\r\\nI can stand the stuff, but I\\'ll never like it, and the tractor\\'s\\r\\nstuffy enough already. I\\'ve taken enough of it.\\r\\nAnd it keeps reminding me of our test\\xe2\\x80\\x94the three of\\r\\nyou stinking up the place, puffing and blowing that\\r\\nout, while I couldn\\'t even get a breath of air....\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She was getting logorrhea herself now and\\xe2\\x80\\x94</p>\\r\\n<p>The answer finally hit him! He jerked around, making\\r\\na grab for Lou\\'s shoulder, motioning for the man\\r\\nto head back.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Bracky\\xe2\\x80\\x94it has to be! Chris, that\\'s it. Jake picked\\r\\nout the second group of men from his friends\\xe2\\x80\\x94and\\r\\nthey are all cronies because they hang around so much\\r\\nin their so-called smoking room. The first time, it killed\\r\\nthe bugs for all of us who smoked\\xe2\\x80\\x94and it didn\\'t work\\r\\nfor you because you never learned the habit.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Lou had the tractor turned and the rheostat all the\\r\\nway to the floor.</p>\\r\\n<p>She was sitting up now, but she wasn\\'t fully satisfied.\\r\\n\"The percentage of immunes seems about right. But\\r\\nwhy do some of the smokers get the disease while some\\r\\ndon\\'t?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Why not? It depends on whether they pick up the\\r\\nhabit before or after the disease gets started. Tom must<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_116\">[Pg 116]</a></span>\\r\\nhave got his while he was in Northport. They wouldn\\'t\\r\\nlet him smoke there\\xe2\\x80\\x94if he had the habit before, for\\r\\nthat matter.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She found no fault with that. He twisted it back and\\r\\nforth in his mind, trying to find a fault. There seemed\\r\\nto be none. The only trouble was that they couldn\\'t\\r\\nsend a message that bracky was the cure and hope that\\r\\nEarth would prove it true. No polite note of apology\\r\\nwould do after that. They had to be sure. Too many\\r\\nother ideas had proved wrong already.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake saw them coming and came running toward the\\r\\nlaboratory, but Lou stopped the tractor before it\\r\\nreached the building and let the older man in.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Get me a dozen men who have the plague. I want\\r\\nthe worst cases you have, and ones that Harkness tested\\r\\nhimself,\" Doc ordered. \"And then start praying that\\r\\nthe cure we\\'ve got works fast.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Chris was at the electron mike at once, but one of\\r\\nher hands reached out for the weed. She began puffing\\r\\nvaliantly, making sick faces. Now other men began\\r\\ncoming in, their faces struggling to find hope, but not\\r\\ndaring to believe yet. Jake followed them.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We\\'ll test at ten-minute intervals. That will be about\\r\\ntwo hours for the last from the group,\" Doc decided.\\r\\nOne of the doctors Harkness had brought to the villages\\r\\nwas busy cutting tiny sections from the lumps on\\r\\nthe men\\'s necks, while Chris ran them through the microscope\\r\\nto make sure the bugs were still alive. The\\r\\nregular optical mike was strong enough for that.</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc handed each man a bracky weed, with instructions\\r\\nto keep smoking, no matter how sick it made him.</p>\\r\\n<p>There were no results at the end of ten minutes\\r\\nwhen the first test was made. The second, at the end of\\r\\ntwenty minutes, was still infected with live bugs. At<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_117\">[Pg 117]</a></span>\\r\\nthe half-hour, Chris frowned.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I can\\'t be sure\\xe2\\x80\\x94take a look, Dan.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He bent over, moving the slide to examine another\\r\\nspot. \"I think so. The next one should tell.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>There was no doubt about the fourth test. The bugs\\r\\nwere dead, without a single exception that they could\\r\\nfind.</p>\\r\\n<p>One by one, the men were tested and went storming\\r\\nout, shouting the news. For a minute, the gathering\\r\\ncrowd was skeptical, remembering the other failures.\\r\\nThen, abruptly, men were screaming, crying and fighting\\r\\nfor the precious bracky, like the legions of the\\r\\ndamned grabbing for lottery tickets when the prize was\\r\\na passport to paradise.</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake swore as he moved toward the door. \"We\\'re low\\r\\non bracky here. Have to get a supply from Edison,\\r\\nI guess, and cart it to the shuttle. Enough for a sample,\\r\\nand to make them want more. It\\'ll be tough, but\\r\\nwe\\'ll get it there in time\\xe2\\x80\\x94by the time the shuttle should\\r\\nbe picking you up. Doc, you\\'ve won our war! From\\r\\nnow on, if Earth wants to keep her population up, we\\'ll\\r\\nbe a free planet!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Chris turned slowly from the microscope, holding a\\r\\nslide in her hands. \"My bugs,\" she said unbelievingly.\\r\\n\"Dan, they\\'re dead!\"</p>\\r\\n<p>Jake patted her shoulder. \"That makes it perfect,\\r\\ngirl. Now come on. We\\'ve got to start celebrating a\\r\\nvictory!\"</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 45%;\">\\r\\n<p>It was the general feeling of most of the heads of the\\r\\nvillages when they met the next day in Southport, using\\r\\nthe courtroom that had been presided over so long by\\r\\nJudge Ben Wilson. It was victory, and to the victor\\r\\nbelonged the spoils. The bracky had gone out to Earth<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_118\">[Pg 118]</a></span>\\r\\non a converted war rocket that could make the trip in\\r\\nless than two weeks, and one packet had been specially\\r\\nlabeled for Captain Everts. But Earth had already confirmed\\r\\nthe cure. The small amounts of the herb found\\r\\nin the botanical collections had been enough to satisfy\\r\\nall doubts.</p>\\r\\n<p>Harkness, Chris and Doc had been fighting against\\r\\nthe desire to rob Earth blind that filled most of the\\r\\nmen here for hours now. Now they had the backing\\r\\nof Jake and Ben Wilson. And now finally they leaned\\r\\nback, sensing that the argument had been won.</p>\\r\\n<p>Bargaining was all right in its place, but it had no\\r\\nplace in affairs of life and death such as this. They\\r\\nhad to see that Earth received all the bracky she\\r\\nneeded. It was only right to charge a fair price for it,\\r\\nbut they couldn\\'t restrict it by withholding or overcharging.\\r\\nAnd they could still gain their ends without\\r\\nblackmail.</p>\\r\\n<p>Martian alkaloids were tricky things, and bracky\\r\\nsmoke contained a number of them. It would take Earth\\r\\nat least ten years to discover and synthesize the right\\r\\none\\xe2\\x80\\x94and it would still probably cost more than it\\r\\nwould to import the weed from Mars. As long as the\\r\\nsource of that weed was here, and in the hands of the\\r\\ncolonials, there would be no danger of Earth\\'s bombing\\r\\nthe planet.</p>\\r\\n<p>Harkness got up to underscore a point Wilson had\\r\\nmade. \"The plague lived a million years, and it won\\'t\\r\\ndisappear now. The jumping headache, or <ins class=\"correction\" title=\"Transcriber\\'s Note: Original had \\'Selnick\\'s\\'.\">Selznick\\'s</ins> migraine,\\r\\nis unpleasant enough to make us reasonably sure\\r\\nthat there will be a steady consumption of the weed.\\r\\nOur problem will be to keep the children from using\\r\\ntoo much of it, probably.\" He pulled a weed out and\\r\\nlighted it, puckering his face as the smoke bit his<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_119\">[Pg 119]</a></span>\\r\\ntongue. \"I\\'m told that this gets to be an enjoyable habit.\\r\\nIf I can believe that, surely you can believe me when\\r\\nI say we don\\'t have to bargain with lives.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>The village men were human, and most of them\\r\\ncould remember the strain they had been under when\\r\\nthey expected those they loved to die at any hour. It\\r\\nhad made them crave vengeance, but now as they had\\r\\na chance to reexamine it, they began to find it harder\\r\\nto impose the horror of any such threat on others. The\\r\\nfinal vote was almost unanimous.</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc listened as they wrangled over the wording of\\r\\nthe message to Earth, feeling disconnected from it. He\\r\\npassed Chris a bracky and lighted it for her. She took\\r\\nit automatically, smiling as the smoke hit her lungs. It\\r\\nwas one thing they had in common now, at least.</p>\\r\\n<p>Ben Wilson finally read the message.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"To the people of Earth, greetings!</p>\\r\\n<p>\"On behalf of the free people of Mars, I have the\\r\\nhonor to announce that this planet hereby declares itself\\r\\na sovereign and independent world. We shall continue\\r\\nto regard Earth as our mother, and to consider\\r\\nthe health and welfare of her people in no way second\\r\\nto our own in matters which affect both planets. We\\r\\ntrust that Earth will share this feeling of mutual friendship.\\r\\nWe trust that all strains of hostility will be ended.\\r\\nThe advantages to each from peaceful commerce make\\r\\nany course other than the most cordial of relations unthinkable.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"We shall consider proof of such friendship an order\\r\\nby Earth to all rockets circling this planet that they\\r\\nshall deliver themselves safely into our hands, in order\\r\\nthat we may begin converting them to peaceful purposes\\r\\nfor the trade that is to come. In turn, we pledge\\r\\nthat all efforts will be made to ensure a prompt de<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_120\">[Pg 120]</a></span>livery\\r\\nof those products most in demand, including the\\r\\ncurative bracky plant.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He turned to Doc then. \"You want to sign it, Dr.\\r\\nFeldman? Make it as acting president or something, until\\r\\nwe can get around to voting you into permanent\\r\\noffice.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You and Jake fight over the job,\" Doc told him.\\r\\n\"No, Ben, I mean it.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He got up and moved out into the outer room, where\\r\\nhe could avoid the stares of amazement that were\\r\\nturned to him. He\\'d never asked for the honor, and he\\r\\ndidn\\'t want it.</p>\\r\\n<p>Chris came with him. Her face was shocked and\\r\\nsomething was slowly draining out of it as he looked\\r\\nat her.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"Forget it, Chris,\" he said. \"You\\'re going back to\\r\\nEarth. There is nothing for you here.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She hadn\\'t quite given up. \"There could be, Dan.\\r\\nYou know that.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"No. No, Chris, I don\\'t think there ever can be. You\\r\\ncan\\'t find a man strong enough to rule who\\'ll be weak\\r\\nenough to let you rule in his place. It didn\\'t work on\\r\\nEarth, and it won\\'t work here. Forget the dreams you\\r\\nhad of what could be done with a new planet. Those\\r\\nare the dreams that made a mess of the old one.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>\"I\\'ll be back,\" she told him. \"Some day I\\'ll be back.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He shook his head again. \"No. You wouldn\\'t like\\r\\nwhat you find here. Freedom is heady stuff, but you\\r\\nhave to have a taste for it. You can\\'t acquire a fondness\\r\\nfor it secondhand. And for a while, there\\'s going\\r\\nto be freedom here. Besides, once you get back to\\r\\nEarth, you\\'ll forget what happened here.\"</p>\\r\\n<p>She sighed at last. For the first time since he had\\r\\nknown her, she seemed to give in completely. And for<span class=\"pagenum\"><a id=\"Page_121\">[Pg 121]</a></span>\\r\\nthat brief moment, he loved what she could have been,\\r\\nbut never would be.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"All right, Dan,\" she said quietly. \"I can\\'t fight you.\\r\\nI never could, I see now. I\\'ll take the rocket back.\\r\\nWhat are you going to do?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>He hadn\\'t bothered to think, but he knew the answer.\\r\\n\"Research. What else?\"</p>\\r\\n<p>There would be a lot of research done here. It had\\r\\nbeen suppressed too long, and had piled up a back-pressure\\r\\nthat would have to be relieved. And from that\\r\\nresearch, he suspected, would come the end of the stable\\r\\noligarchy of Earth. It could never stand against the\\r\\nchanges that would be pouring out of Mars.</p>\\r\\n<p>She put her hands on his shoulders and moved forward\\r\\nto kiss him. He bent down to meet her, and\\r\\nfound her eyes were wet. Maybe his were, too. Then\\r\\nshe broke free.</p>\\r\\n<p>\"You\\'re a fool, Dan Feldman,\" she whispered, and\\r\\nbegan moving down the hallway and out of the council\\r\\nhall of Mars.</p>\\r\\n<p>Doc Feldman nodded slowly as he let her go. He\\r\\nwas a fool. He had always been a fool, and always\\r\\nwould be. And that was why he could never take over\\r\\nleadership here. Fools and idealists should never govern\\r\\na world. It took practical men such as Jake to do that.</p>\\r\\n<p>But the practical men needed the foolish idealists, too.\\r\\nAnd maybe for a time here on Mars their kind of men\\r\\nand his kind of fools could make one more stab at the\\r\\nancient puzzle of freedom.</p>\\r\\n<p>Outside the war rockets of Earth began landing\\r\\nquietly on the free soil of Mars.</p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 65%;\">\\r\\n<h2>ANDRE NORTON</h2>\\r\\n<div class=\"center\">\\r\\n<table style=\"border-spacing: 0px;padding: 4px;border-width: 0px;\">\\r\\n<tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">051615</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Beast Master</b> 75c</td></tr>\\r\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">092668</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Catseye</b> 75c</td></tr>\\r\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">123117</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>The Crossroads of Time</b> 60c</td></tr>\\r\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">137950</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Dark Piper</b> 60c</td></tr>\\r\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">139923</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Daybreak, 2250 A.D.</b> 75c</td></tr>\\r\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">142323</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Defiant Agents</b> 75c</td></tr>\\r\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">166694</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Dread Companion</b> 75c</td></tr>\\r\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">223651</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Exiles of the Stars</b> 95c</td></tr>\\r\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">272260</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Galactic Derelict</b> 75c</td></tr>\\r\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">337014</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>High Sorcery</b> 75c</td></tr>\\r\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">354217</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Huon of the Horn</b> 60c</td></tr>\\r\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">358408</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Ice Crown</b> 75c</td></tr>\\r\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">415513</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Judgment on Janus</b> 75c</td></tr>\\r\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">436725</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Key Out of Time</b> 75c</td></tr>\\r\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">471615</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>The Last Planet</b> 60c</td></tr>\\r\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">492363</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Lord of Thunder</b> 75c</td></tr>\\r\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">541011</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Moon of Three Rings</b> 75c</td></tr>\\r\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">577510</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Night of Masks</b> 60c</td></tr>\\r\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">634105</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Operation Time Search</b> 60c</td></tr>\\r\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">638213</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Ordeal In Otherwhere</b> 60c</td></tr>\\r\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">668319</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Plague Ship</b> 60c</td></tr>\\r\\n<tr><td style=\"text-align: left;\">675553</td><td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Postmarked the Stars</b> 75c</td></tr>\\r\\n</tbody></table></div>\\r\\n<p class=\"center\"><i><b>Available wherever paperbacks are sold or use this coupon.</b></i></p>\\r\\n<hr style=\"width: 45%;\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>ace books</b>, (Dept.

Yet it was still in a pitiable state of weakness\\r\\nand destitution. The care and maintenance of the settlement\\r\\nhad devolved upon trading companies, and their narrow-minded\\r\\nmercantile selfishness had stifled its progress. From\\r\\nother causes, also, there had been but little growth.\\r\\nCardinal Richelieu, the great French minister, had tried\\r\\nat one time to infuse new life into the colony; [Footnote:\\r\\nFor the earlier history of New France the reader is\\r\\nreferred to three other volumes in this Series\\xe2\\x80\\x94The\\r\\nFounder of New France, The Seigneurs of Old Canada, and\\r\\nThe Jesuit Missions.] but his first attempts had been\\r\\nunlucky, and later on his powerful mind was diverted to\\r\\nother plans and achievements and he became absorbed in\\r\\nthe wider field of European politics. To the shackles of\\r\\ncommercial greed, to forgetfulness on the part of the\\r\\nmother country, had been added the curse of Indian wars.\\r\\nDuring twenty-five years the daring and ferocious Iroquois\\r\\nhad been the constant scourge of the handful of settlers,\\r\\ntraders, and missionaries. Champlain\\'s successors in the\\r\\noffice of governor, Montmagny, Ailleboust, Lauzon,\\r\\nArgenson, Avaugour, had no military force adequate to\\r\\nthe task of meeting and crushing these formidable foes.\\r\\nYear after year the wretched colony maintained its struggle\\r\\nfor existence amidst deadly perils, receiving almost no\\r\\nhelp from France, and to all appearance doomed to\\r\\ndestruction. To make things worse, internal strife\\r\\nexercised its disintegrating influence; there was contention\\r\\namong the leaders in New France over the vexed question\\r\\nof the liquor traffic. In the face of so many adverse\\r\\ncircumstances\\xe2\\x80\\x94complete lack of means, cessation of\\r\\nimmigration from the mother country, the perpetual menace\\r\\nof the bloody Iroquois incursions, a dying trade, and a\\r\\nstillborn agriculture\\xe2\\x80\\x94how could the colony be kept alive\\r\\nat all? Spiritual and civil authorities, the governor\\r\\nand the bishop, the Jesuits and the traders, all united\\r\\nin petitioning for assistance. But the motherland was\\r\\nfar away, and European wars and rivalries were engrossing\\r\\nall her attention.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00009\">Fortunately a change was at hand. The prolonged struggle\\r\\nof the Thirty Years\\' War and of the war against Spain\\r\\nhad been ended by the treaty of Munster and Osnabruck in\\r\\n1648 and by that of the Pyrenees in 1659. The civil\\r\\ndissensions of the Fronde were over, thanks to the skilful\\r\\npolicy of Cardinal Mazarin, Richelieu\\'s successor. After\\r\\nthe death of Mazarin in 1661, Louis XIV had taken into\\r\\nhis own hands the reins of administration. He was young,\\r\\npainstaking, and ambitious; and he wanted to be not only\\r\\nking but the real ruler of his kingdom. In Jean Baptiste\\r\\nColbert, the man who had been Mazarin\\'s right hand, he\\r\\nhad the good fortune to find one of the best administrators\\r\\nin all French history. Colbert soon won the king\\'s\\r\\nconfidence. He was instrumental in detecting the\\r\\nmaladministration of Fouquet as superintendent of Finance,\\r\\nand became a member of the council appointed to investigate\\r\\nand report on all financial questions. Of this body he\\r\\nwas the leading spirit from the beginning. Although at\\r\\nfirst without the title of minister, he was promptly\\r\\ninvested with a wide authority over the finances, trade,\\r\\nagriculture, industry, and marine affairs. Within two\\r\\nyears he had shown his worth and had justified the king\\'s\\r\\nchoice. Great and beneficial reforms had been accomplished\\r\\nin almost every branch of the administration. The exhausted\\r\\ntreasury had been replenished, trade and industry were\\r\\nencouraged, agriculture was protected, and a navy created.\\r\\nUnder a progressive government France seemed to awake to\\r\\nnew life.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00010\">The hour was auspicious for the entreaties of New France.\\r\\nPetitions and statements were addressed to the king by\\r\\nMgr de Laval, the head of ecclesiastical affairs in the\\r\\ncolony, by the governor Avaugour, and by the Jesuit\\r\\nfathers; and Pierre Boucher, governor of the district of\\r\\nThree Rivers, was sent to France as a delegate to present\\r\\nthem. Louis and his minister studied the conditions of\\r\\nthe colony on the St Lawrence and decided in 1663 to give\\r\\nit a new constitution. The charter of the One Hundred\\r\\nAssociates was cancelled and the old Council of\\r\\nQuebec\\xe2\\x80\\x94formed in 1647\\xe2\\x80\\x94was reorganized under the name\\r\\nof the Sovereign Council. This new governing body was to\\r\\nbe composed of the governor, the bishop, the intendant,\\r\\nan attorney-general, a secretary, and five councillors.\\r\\nIt was invested with a general jurisdiction for the\\r\\nadministration of justice in civil and criminal matters.\\r\\nIt had also to deal with the questions of police, roads,\\r\\nfinance, and trade.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00011\">To establish a new and improved system of administration\\r\\nwas a good thing, but this alone would hardly avail if\\r\\npowerful help were not forthcoming to rescue New France\\r\\nfrom ruin, despondency, and actual extermination. The\\r\\ncolony was dying for lack of soldiers, settlers, and\\r\\nlabourers, as well as stores of food and munitions of\\r\\nwar for defence and maintenance. Louis XIV made up his\\r\\nmind that help should be given. In 1664 three hundred\\r\\nlabourers were conveyed to Quebec at the king\\'s expense,\\r\\nand in the following year the colonists received the\\r\\nwelcome information that the king was also about to send\\r\\nthem a regiment of trained soldiers, a viceroy, a new\\r\\ngovernor, a new intendant, settlers and labourers, and\\r\\nall kinds of supplies. This royal pledge was adequately\\r\\nfulfilled. On June 19, 1665, the Marquis de Tracy,\\r\\nlieutenant-general of all the French dominions in America,\\r\\narrived from the West Indies, where he had successfully\\r\\ndischarged the first part of the mission entrusted to\\r\\nhim by his royal master. With him came four companies of\\r\\nsoldiers. During the whole summer ships were disembarking\\r\\ntheir passengers and unloading their cargoes of ammunition\\r\\nand provisions at Quebec in quick succession. It is easy\\r\\nto imagine the rapture of the colonists at such a sight,\\r\\nand the enthusiastic shouts that welcomed the first\\r\\ndetachment of the splendid regiment of Carignan-Salieres.\\r\\nAt length, on September 12, the cup of public joy was\\r\\nfilled to overflowing by the arrival of the ship Saint\\r\\nSebastien with two high officials on board, David de\\r\\nRemy, Sieur de Courcelle, the governor appointed to\\r\\nsucceed the governor Mezy, who had died earlier in the\\r\\nyear, and Jean Talon, the intendant of justice, police,\\r\\nand finance. The latter had been selected to replace the\\r\\nSieur Robert, who had been made intendant in 1663, but,\\r\\nfor some unknown reason, had never come to Canada to\\r\\nperform the duties of his office. The triumvirate on whom\\r\\nwas imposed the noble task of saving and reviving New\\r\\nFrance was thus complete. The Marquis de Tracy was an\\r\\nable and clear-sighted commander, the Sieur de Courcelle\\r\\na fearless, straightforward official. But the part of\\r\\nJean Talon in the common task, though apparently less\\r\\nbrilliant, was to be in many respects the most important,\\r\\nand his influence the most far-reaching in the destinies\\r\\nof the colony.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00012\">Talon was born at Chalons-sur-Marne, in the province of\\r\\nChampagne, about the year 1625. His family were kinsfolk\\r\\nof the Parisian Talons, Omer and Denis, the celebrated\\r\\njurists and lawyers, who held in succession the high\\r\\noffice of attorney-general of France. Several of Jean\\r\\nTalon\\'s brothers were serving in the administration or\\r\\nthe army, and, after a course of study at the Jesuits\\'\\r\\nCollege of Clermont, Jean was employed under one of them\\r\\nin the commissariat. The young man\\'s abilities soon became\\r\\napparent and attracted Mazarin\\'s attention. In 1654 he\\r\\nwas appointed military commissary at Le Quesnoy in\\r\\nconnection with the operations of the army commanded by\\r\\nthe great Turenne. A year later, at the age of thirty,\\r\\nhe was promoted to be intendant for the province of\\r\\nHainault. For ten years he filled that office and won\\r\\nthe reputation of an administrator of the first rank.\\r\\nThus it came about that, when an intendant was needed to\\r\\ninfuse new blood into the veins of the feeble colony on\\r\\nthe St Lawrence, Colbert, always a good judge of men,\\r\\nthought immediately of Jean Talon and recommended to the\\r\\nking his appointment as intendant of New France. Talon\\'s\\r\\ncommission is dated March 23, 1665.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00013\">The minister drafted for the intendant\\'s guidance a long\\r\\nletter of instructions. It dealt with the mutual relations\\r\\nof Church and State, and set forth the Gallican principles\\r\\nof the day; it discussed the question of assistance to\\r\\nthe recently created West India Company; the contemplated\\r\\nwar against the Iroquois and how it might successfully\\r\\nbe carried on; the Sovereign Council and the administration\\r\\nof justice; the settlement of the colony and the\\r\\nadvisability of concentrating the population; the\\r\\nimportance of fostering trade and industry; the question\\r\\nof tithes for the maintenance of the Church; the\\r\\nestablishment of shipbuilding yards and the encouragement\\r\\nof agriculture. This document was signed by Louis XIV\\r\\nat Paris on March 27, 1665.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00014\">On receiving his commission and his instructions, Talon\\r\\ntook leave of the king and the minister, and proceeded\\r\\nto make preparations for his arduous mission and for the\\r\\nlong journey which it involved. By April 22 he was at La\\r\\nRochelle, to arrange for the embarkation of settlers,\\r\\nworking men, and supplies. He attended the review of the\\r\\ntroops that were bound for New France, and reported to\\r\\nColbert that the companies were at their full strength,\\r\\nwell equipped and in the best of spirits. During this\\r\\ntime he spared no pains to acquire information about the\\r\\nnew country where he was to work and live. Finally, by\\r\\nMay 24, everything was in readiness, and he wrote to\\r\\nColbert:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00015\" style=\"margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%\">   Since apparently I shall not have the honour of writing\\r\\n   you another letter from this place, for our ship awaits\\r\\n   only a favourable wind to sail, allow me to assure\\r\\n   you that I am leaving full of gratitude for all the\\r\\n   kindness and favours bestowed on me by the king and\\r\\n   yourself. Knowing that the best way to show my gratitude\\r\\n   is to do good service to His Majesty, and that the\\r\\n   best title to future benevolence lies in strenuous\\r\\n   effort for the successful execution of his wishes, I\\r\\n   shall do my utmost to attain that end in the charge\\r\\n   I am going to fill. I pray for your protection and\\r\\n   help, which will surely be needed, and if my endeavours\\r\\n   should not be crowned with success, at least it will\\r\\n   not be for want of zeal and fidelity.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00016\">A few hours after having written these farewell lines,<br>\\r\\n\\r\\nTalon, in company with M. de Courcelle, set sail on the<br>\\r\\n\\r\\nSaint Sebastien for Canada, where he was to make for<br>\\r\\n\\r\\nhimself an imperishable name.<br>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 id=\"id00017\" style=\"margin-top: 4em\">CHAPTER II</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5 id=\"id00018\">NEW FRANCE IN 1665</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00019\">Let us take a glance over the colony at the time when\\r\\nCourcelle and Talon landed at Quebec after an ocean\\r\\njourney\\xe2\\x80\\x94there were no fast lines then\\xe2\\x80\\x94of one hundred\\r\\nand seventeen days.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00020\">In 1665 Canada had only three settled districts: Quebec,\\r\\nThree Rivers, and Ville-Marie or Montreal. Quebec, the\\r\\nchief town, bore the proud title of the capital of New\\r\\nFrance. Yet it contained barely seventy houses with about\\r\\nfive hundred and fifty inhabitants. Then, as now, it\\r\\nconsisted of a lower and an upper town. In the lower town\\r\\nwere to be found the king\\'s stores and the merchants\\'\\r\\nshops and residences. The public officials and the clergy\\r\\nand members of the religious orders lived in the upper\\r\\ntown, where stood the principal buildings of the\\r\\ncapital\\xe2\\x80\\x94the Chateau Saint-Louis, the Bishop\\'s Palace,\\r\\nthe Cathedral, the Jesuits\\' College and Chapel, and the\\r\\nmonasteries of the Ursulines and of the Hotel-Dieu sisters.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00021\">Francois de Laval de Montmorency, bishop of Petraea and\\r\\nvicar apostolic for Canada, was the spiritual head of\\r\\nthe colony. He had arrived from France six years earlier,\\r\\nin 1659, and was destined to spend the remainder of his\\r\\nlife, nearly half a century, in the service of the Church\\r\\nin Canada. Because of his noble character and many virtues,\\r\\nhis strong intellect, and his devotion to the public\\r\\nweal, he will ever rank as one of the greatest figures\\r\\nin Canadian history. His vicar-general was Henri de\\r\\nBernieres, who was also parish priest of Quebec and\\r\\nsuperior of the seminary founded by the bishop in 1663.\\r\\nThe superior of the Jesuits was Father Le Mercier. The\\r\\nsaintly Marie de l\\'Incarnation was mother superior of\\r\\nthe Ursulines, and Mother Saint Bonaventure of the\\r\\nHotel-Dieu.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00022\">It may be interesting to recall the names of some of the\\r\\nnotable citizens of Quebec at that time, other than the\\r\\nhigh officials. There were Michel Filion and Pierre\\r\\nDuquet, notaries; Jean Madry, surgeon to the king\\'s\\r\\nmajesty; Jean Le Mire, the future syndic des habitants;\\r\\nMadame d\\'Ailleboust, widow of a former governor; Madame\\r\\nCouillard, widow of Guillaume Couillard and daughter of\\r\\nLouis Hebert, the first tiller of the soil; Madame de\\r\\nRepentigny, widow of \\'Admiral\\' de Repentigny, to use the\\r\\ngrandiloquent expression of old chroniclers; Nicolas\\r\\nMarsollet, Louis Couillard de l\\'Espinay, Charles Roger\\r\\nde Colombiers, Francois Bissot, Charles Amiot, Le Gardeur\\r\\nde Repentigny, Dupont de Neuville, Pierre Denis de la\\r\\nRonde, all men of high standing. The chief merchants were\\r\\nCharles Basire, Jacques Loyer de Latour, Claude Charron,\\r\\nJean Maheut, Eustache Lambert, Bertrand Chesnay de la\\r\\nGarenne, Guillaume Feniou. Charles Aubert de la Chesnaye,\\r\\nthe stalwart Quebec trader of the day, was then in France.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00023\">In the neighbourhood of Quebec were a few settlements.\\r\\nAccording to the census of the following year there were\\r\\n452 persons on the Island of Orleans, 533 at the Cote\\r\\nBeaupre, 185 at Beauport, 140 at Sillery, and 112 at\\r\\nCharlesbourg and Notre-Dame-des-Anges on the St Charles\\r\\nriver.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00024\">Three Rivers was a small port with a population of 455,\\r\\nincluding that of the adjoining settlements. The governor\\r\\nin charge of the local administration was Pierre Boucher,\\r\\nalready mentioned as a delegate to France in 1661. The\\r\\nJesuits had a residence there and a chapel which was the\\r\\nonly place of public worship, for the colonists had not\\r\\nas yet the means to erect a parish church. In the vicinity\\r\\nthere were the beginnings of settlement at Cap-de-la-\\r\\nMagdeleine, Batiscan, and Champlain. Among the important\\r\\nfamilies of Three Rivers were those of Godefroy, Hertel,\\r\\nLe Neuf, Crevier, Boucher, Poulin, Volant, Lemaitre,\\r\\nRivard, and Ameau. Michel Le Neuf du Herisson was juge\\r\\nroyal, and Severin Ameau was notary and registrar of the\\r\\ncourt.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00025\">Montreal or Ville-Marie was scarcely more important than\\r\\nThree Rivers. The population of the whole district numbered\\r\\nonly 625. A fort built by Maisonneuve and Ailleboust at\\r\\nPointe-a-Callieres; the house of the Sulpicians at the\\r\\nfoot of the present Saint-Sulpice Street; the Hotel-Dieu\\r\\non the other side of that street; the convent of the\\r\\nCongregation sisters facing the Hotel-Dieu; a few houses\\r\\nscattered along the road called \\'de la Commune,\\' now\\r\\nSaint-Paul Street; and on the rising ground towards the\\r\\nPlace d\\'Armes of later years a few more dwellings\\xe2\\x80\\x94these\\r\\nconstituted the Montreal of primitive days. On the top\\r\\nof the hill called \\'Coteau Saint-Louis\\' was erected an\\r\\nintrenched mill\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\'Moulin du Coteau\\'\\xe2\\x80\\x94which could be used\\r\\nas a redoubt to protect the inhabitants. The Sulpicians\\'\\r\\nhouse, the Hotel-Dieu, the convent of the Congregation,\\r\\nand the houses of the Place d\\'Armes and of \\'la Commune\\'\\r\\nwere connected with the fort by footpaths. Before 1672\\r\\nthere were no streets laid out. The only place of public\\r\\nworship was the Hotel-Dieu chapel, fifty feet in length\\r\\nby thirty in width. The superior of the Sulpicians was\\r\\nAbbe Souart. Mother Mace was superioress of the Hotel-Dieu,\\r\\nbut the mainstay of the institution was the well-known\\r\\nMademoiselle Mance, who, by the aid of Madame de Bullion\\'s\\r\\nbenefactions, had founded it in 1643. The illustrious\\r\\nSister Marguerite Bourgeoys was at the head of the\\r\\nCongregation, which owed its existence to her pious zeal\\r\\nand devotion to the education of the young. Among the\\r\\n\\'Montrealistes\\' of note the following should be specially\\r\\nmentioned: Zacharie Dupuy, major of the island; Charles\\r\\nd\\'Ailleboust, seigneurial judge; J. B. Migeon de Bransac,\\r\\nfiscal attorney; Louis Artus Sailly, who had been for\\r\\nsome time juge royal; Benigne Basset, at once registrar\\r\\nof the seigneurial court, notary, and surveyor; Charles\\r\\nLe Moyne, king\\'s treasurer, interpreter, soldier, settler,\\r\\nwho was later to be ennobled and receive the title of\\r\\nBaron de Longueuil; Etienne Bouchard, surgeon; Pierre\\r\\nPicote de Belestre, a valiant militia officer; Claude de\\r\\nRobutel, Sieur de Saint-Andre; Jacques Leber, a merchant\\r\\nwho controlled almost the whole trade of Ville-Marie.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00026\">Altogether the white population of Canada, including the\\r\\nsettlers and labourers arriving during the summer of\\r\\n1665, numbered only 3215. Yet the colony had been in\\r\\nexistence for fifty-seven years! It was certainly time\\r\\nfor a new effort on the part of the mother country to\\r\\ninfuse life into her feeble offspring. This was a task\\r\\ncalling for the earnest care and the most energetic\\r\\nactivity of Tracy, Courcelle, and Talon.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00027\">One of the first matters to receive their attention was\\r\\nthe reorganization of the Canadian administration. We\\r\\nhave seen that in 1663 the Sovereign Council had been\\r\\ncreated, to consist of the high officials of the colony\\r\\nand five councillors. At this time, September 1665, the\\r\\nfive councillors were Mathieu Damours, Le Gardeur de\\r\\nTilly, and three others who had been irregularly appointed\\r\\nby Mezy, the preceding governor, to take the places of\\r\\nthree councillors whom he had arbitrarily dismissed\\xe2\\x80\\x94Rouer\\r\\nde Villeray, Juchereau de la Ferte, and Ruette d\\'Auteuil.\\r\\nThe same governor had also dismissed Jean Bourdon, the\\r\\nattorney-general, and had replaced him by Chartier de\\r\\nLotbiniere. These summary dismissals and appointments\\r\\nhad arisen out of a quarrel between the governor and the\\r\\nbishop, in which the former appears to have been influenced\\r\\nby petty motives. At any rate Mezy had been recalled by\\r\\nthe king; and Tracy, Courcelle, and Talon had been\\r\\ninstructed to try him for improper conduct in office.\\r\\nBut before their arrival at Quebec, Mezy had obeyed the\\r\\nsummons of another King than the king of France. He had\\r\\nbeen taken ill in the spring of the year and had died on\\r\\nMay 6. Mezy being dead, it was wisely thought unnecessary\\r\\nto recall unhappy memories of his errors and misdeeds.\\r\\nSufficient would be done if the grievances due to his\\r\\nrashness were redressed. Accordingly the dismissed\\r\\nofficials were reinstated, and on September 23, 1665, a\\r\\nsolemn sitting of the Sovereign Council was held, at\\r\\nwhich Tracy, Courcelle, Laval, and Talon were present,\\r\\ntogether with the Sieur Le Barroys, general agent of the\\r\\nWest India Company, and the Sieurs de Villeray, de la\\r\\nFerte, d\\'Auteuil, de Tilly, Damours\\xe2\\x80\\x94all the councillors\\r\\nin office before Mezy\\'s dismissals\\xe2\\x80\\x94Jean Bourdon, the\\r\\nattorney-general, and J. B. Peuvret, secretary of the\\r\\ncouncil. The letters patent of Courcelle and Talon as\\r\\nwell as the commission and credentials of the Sieur Le\\r\\nBarroys were duly read and registered; the letters patent\\r\\nof the Marquis de Tracy had been registered previously.\\r\\nWith these formalities the new administration of Canada\\r\\nwas inaugurated.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00028\">The next proceeding of the rulers of New France was to\\r\\nprepare for a decisive blow against the daring Iroquois.\\r\\nTracy and the soldiers, as we have seen, had arrived in\\r\\nJune and three forts were in course of building on the\\r\\nRichelieu river, or \\'riviere des Iroquois,\\' so called\\r\\nbecause for a long period it had been the most direct\\r\\nhighway leading from the villages of these bloody warriors\\r\\nto the heart of the colony. During the summer and autumn\\r\\nof 1665 the Carignan soldiers were kept busy with the\\r\\nconstruction of these necessary defensive works. The\\r\\nfirst fort was erected at the mouth of the river, under\\r\\nthe direction of Captain de Sorel; the second fifty miles\\r\\nhigher, under Captain de Chambly; and the third about\\r\\nnine miles farther up, under Colonel de Salieres. The\\r\\nfirst two retained the names of the officers in charge\\r\\nof their construction, and the third received the name\\r\\nof Sainte-Therese because it was finished on the day\\r\\ndedicated to that saint. During the following year two\\r\\nother forts were built\\xe2\\x80\\x94St John, a few miles distant from\\r\\nSainte-Therese, and Sainte-Anne, on an island at the head\\r\\nof Lake Champlain. Both Tracy and Courcelle went to\\r\\ninspect the work personally and encourage the garrisons.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00029\">In the meantime Talon was in no way idle. He had to\\r\\norganize the means of conveying provisions, ammunition,\\r\\ntools, and supplies of every description for the maintenance\\r\\nof the troops and the furtherance of the work. Under his\\r\\nsupervision a flotilla of over fifty boats plied between\\r\\nQuebec and the river Richelieu. It was also his business\\r\\nto take care of the incoming soldiers and labourers and\\r\\nto see that those who had contracted disease during their\\r\\njourney across the ocean received proper nursing and\\r\\nmedical attendance.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00030\">From the moment of his arrival he had lost no opportunity\\r\\nof acquiring information on the situation in the colony.\\r\\nThere is a curious anecdote that illustrates the manner\\r\\nin which he sometimes contrived to gain knowledge by\\r\\nconcealing his identity. On the very day of his landing\\r\\nhe went alone to the Hotel-Dieu, and asking for the\\r\\nsuperioress, introduced himself as the valet de chambre\\r\\nof the intendant, pretending to be sent by his master to\\r\\nassure the good ladies of the hospital of M. Talon\\'s\\r\\nkindly disposition and desire to bestow on them every\\r\\nfavour in his gift. One of the sisters present at the\\r\\ninterview\\xe2\\x80\\x94Mere de la Nativite, a very bright and clever\\r\\nwoman\\xe2\\x80\\x94was struck by the extreme distinction of manner\\r\\nand speech of the so-called valet, and, with a meaning\\r\\nglance at the superioress, told the visitor that unless\\r\\nshe was mistaken he was more than he pretended to be. On\\r\\nhis asking what could convey to her that impression, she\\r\\nreplied that by his bearing and language she could not\\r\\nbut feel that the intendant himself was honouring the\\r\\nHotel-Dieu with a visit. Talon could do no less than\\r\\nconfess that she was right, showing at the same time that\\r\\nhe appreciated the delicate compliment thus paid to him.\\r\\nFrom that day he was a devoted and most generous friend\\r\\nto the Hotel-Dieu of Quebec.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00031\">One of the first problems with which the intendant had\\r\\nto deal in discharging the duties of his office was the\\r\\ndualism of administrative authority. It has been mentioned\\r\\nthat Colbert had founded a new trading company, known as\\r\\nthe West India Company. This corporation had been granted\\r\\nwide privileges over all the French possessions in America,\\r\\nincluding feudal ownership and authority to administer\\r\\njustice and levy war. The company was thus invested with\\r\\nthe right of appointing judicial officers, magistrates,\\r\\nand sovereign councils, and of naming, subject to the\\r\\nking\\'s sanction governors and other functionaries; it\\r\\nhad full power to sell the land or make grants in feudal\\r\\ntenure, to receive all seigneurial dues, to build forts,\\r\\nraise troops, and equip war-ships. The company\\'s charter\\r\\nhad been granted in 1664, and of course Canada, as well\\r\\nas the other French colonies in the New World, was included\\r\\nin its jurisdiction. The situation of this colony was\\r\\ntherefore very peculiar. In 1663 the king had cancelled\\r\\nthe charter of the One Hundred Associates and had taken\\r\\nback the fief of Canada; but a year later he had granted\\r\\nit again to a new company. At the same time he showed\\r\\nclearly that he intended to keep the administration in\\r\\nhis own hands. Thus Canada seemed to have two masters.\\r\\nIn accordance with its charter, the company held the\\r\\nownership and government of the country de jure. But in\\r\\npoint of fact the king wielded the government, thus taking\\r\\nback with one hand what he had given with the other. By\\r\\nright the company controlled the administration of justice;\\r\\nit could, and actually did, establish courts. But, in\\r\\nfact, the king appointed the intendant supreme judge in\\r\\ncivil cases, and made the Sovereign Council a tribunal\\r\\nof superior jurisdiction. By right, to the company belonged\\r\\nthe power of granting land and seigneuries. In fact, the\\r\\ngovernor or the intendant, the king\\'s officers, made the\\r\\ngrants at their pleasure. This strange situation, which\\r\\nlasted ten years\\xe2\\x80\\x94until the West India Company\\'s charter\\r\\nwas revoked in 1674\\xe2\\x80\\x94is often confusing to the student\\r\\nof the period.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00032\">Talon saw at a glance the anomaly of the situation; but,\\r\\nbeing a practical man, he was less displeased with the\\r\\nfalsity of the principle than apprehensive of the evil\\r\\nthat was likely to result. In a letter to Colbert, dated\\r\\nOctober 4, 1665, he discussed the subject at length,\\r\\nputting it in plain terms. If, when the grant was made,\\r\\nit was the king\\'s intention to benefit only the company\\xe2\\x80\\x94to\\r\\nincrease its profits and develop its trade\\xe2\\x80\\x94with no\\r\\nulterior consideration for the development of the colony,\\r\\nthen it would be well to leave to the company the sole\\r\\nownership of the country. But if His Majesty had thought\\r\\nof making Canada one of the prosperous parts of his\\r\\nkingdom, it was very doubtful whether he could attain\\r\\nthat end without keeping in his own hands the control of\\r\\nlands and trade. The real aim of the West India Company,\\r\\nas he had learned, was to enforce its commercial monopoly\\r\\nto the utmost; and become the only trading medium between\\r\\nthe colony and the mother country. Such a policy could\\r\\nhave but one result; it would put an end to private\\r\\nenterprise and discourage immigration.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00033\">In spite of the company\\'s apparent overlordship, Talon\\r\\nthought that, as the king\\'s agent, he was bound to exercise\\r\\nthe powers appertaining to his office for the good of\\r\\nthe colony. By the end of the year 1665 he had planned\\r\\na new settlement in the vicinity of Quebec on lands\\r\\nincluded in the limits of the seigneury of Notre-Dame-\\r\\ndes-Anges at Charlesbourg, which he had withdrawn from\\r\\nthe grant to the Jesuits, under the king\\'s authority.\\r\\nThis was the occasion of some friction between the Jesuits\\r\\nand the intendant. Talon gave the necessary orders for\\r\\nthe erection of about forty dwellings which should be\\r\\nready to receive new settlers during the following year.\\r\\nThese were to be grouped in three adjacent villages named\\r\\nBourg-Royal, Bourg-la-Reine, and Bourg-Talon. We shall\\r\\nlearn more of them in a following chapter.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00034\">Another enterprise of the intendant was numbering the\\r\\npeople. Under his personal supervision, during the winter\\r\\nof 1666-67, a general census of the colony was taken\\xe2\\x80\\x94the\\r\\nfirst Canadian census of which we have any record. The\\r\\ncount showed, as we have already said, a total population\\r\\nof 3215 in Canada at that time\\xe2\\x80\\x942034 males and 1181\\r\\nfemales. The married people numbered 1109, and there were\\r\\n528 families. Elderly people were but few in number, 95\\r\\nonly being from fifty-one to sixty years old, 43 from\\r\\nsixty-one to seventy, 10 from seventy-one to eighty, and\\r\\n4 from eighty-one to ninety. In regard to professions\\r\\nand occupations, there were then in New France 3 notaries,\\r\\n5 surgeons, 18 merchants, 4 bailiffs, 3 schoolmasters,\\r\\n36 carpenters, 27 joiners, 30 tailors, 8 coopers, 5\\r\\nbakers, 9 millers, 3 locksmiths. The census did not\\r\\ninclude the king\\'s troops, which formed a body of 1200\\r\\nmen. The clergy consisted of the bishop, 18 Priests and\\r\\naspirants to the priesthood, and 35 Jesuit fathers. There\\r\\nwere also 19 Ursulines, 23 Hospitalieres, and 4 Sisters\\r\\nof the Congregation. The original record of this, the\\r\\nfirst Canadian census, has been preserved and is without\\r\\nquestion a most important historical document. It is\\r\\nlikewise full of living interest, for in it are recorded\\r\\nthe names of many families whose descendants are now to\\r\\nbe found all over Canada.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 id=\"id00035\" style=\"margin-top: 4em\">CHAPTER III</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5 id=\"id00036\">THE IROQUOIS SUBDUED</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00037\">It was the special task of Tracy and Courcelle to rid\\r\\nthe colony of the Iroquois scourge. The Five Nations\\r\\n[Footnote: The Iroquois league consisted of five tribes\\r\\nor nations\\xe2\\x80\\x94the Mohawks, the Cayugas, the Senecas, the\\r\\nOnondagas, and the Oneidas.] had heard with some disquietude\\r\\nof the body of trained soldiers sent by the French king\\r\\nto check their incursions and crush their confederacy.\\r\\nAt the beginning of December 1665, the Marquis de Tracy\\r\\nreceived an embassy from the Onondagas. They desired to\\r\\nenter into a peace negotiation, and one of the most noted\\r\\nchiefs, Garakonthie, delivered on that occasion a long\\r\\nand eloquent address to the viceroy. A treaty was signed\\r\\nby them on behalf of their own and two of the other\\r\\ntribes, the Senecas and the Oneidas. But meanwhile the\\r\\nOneidas did not cease from hostilities, and the Mohawks\\r\\nalso continued their bloody raids against the French\\r\\nsettlements. Courcelle therefore decided to march at once\\r\\nagainst their villages beyond Lake Champlain, in what is\\r\\nnow New York state and to teach them a lesson. But he\\r\\ndid not know the nature of a winter expedition in this\\r\\nnorthern climate. Leaving Quebec on January 9, he reached\\r\\nThree Rivers on the 16th, and proceeded to Fort Saint-Louis\\r\\non the Richelieu, where he had fixed the rendezvous of\\r\\nthe troops. The cold was very severe, and many soldiers\\r\\nwere frozen at the outset. On January 29 the little band,\\r\\nfive or six hundred French and Canadians, left Fort\\r\\nSaint-Louis, unfortunately without waiting for a party\\r\\nof Algonquins who should have acted as scouts. It was a\\r\\ndistressing march. The soldiers had to walk through deep\\r\\nsnow, and the unfamiliar use of snowshoes was a great\\r\\ntrial to the Europeans. At night, no shelter! They had\\r\\nto sleep in the open air, under the canopy of the sky\\r\\nand the cold light of the glimmering stars. Having no\\r\\nguides, Courcelle and his men lost their way in that\\r\\nunknown country. After seventeen days of extreme toil\\r\\nthey found that, instead of reaching the Mohawk district,\\r\\nthey were near Corlaer in the New Netherlands, sixty\\r\\nmiles distant. The vanguard had a brush with two hundred\\r\\nIroquois, who slipped away after killing six French\\r\\nsoldiers and leaving four of their own number dead. The\\r\\ngovernor could go no farther with his exhausted troops\\r\\nand was forced to retrace his steps. The retreat was\\r\\nworse than the forward march. The supply of provisions\\r\\nfailed, and to the suffering from cold was soon added\\r\\nhunger. Many soldiers died of exposure and starvation.\\r\\nIn reading the account of the ill-fated expedition, one\\r\\nis reminded of the disastrous retreat of Napoleon\\'s army\\r\\nin 1812 through the icy solitudes of Russia. By this sad\\r\\nexperience the military commanders of New France found\\r\\nthat they had something to learn of the art of making\\r\\nwar in North America, and must respect the peculiarities\\r\\nof the climate and country. Nevertheless Courcelle\\'s\\r\\nwinter expedition had made an impression on the minds of\\r\\nthe Iroquois and had even surprised the Dutch and the\\r\\nEnglish. The author of a narrative entitled Relation of\\r\\nthe March of the Governor of Canada into New York wrote:\\r\\n\\'Surely so bold and hardy an attempt hath not happened\\r\\nin any age.\\'</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00038\">Apparently the Five Nations were somewhat uneasy, for in\\r\\nMarch the Senecas sent ambassadors to the Marquis de\\r\\nTracy to ratify the treaty signed in December. In July\\r\\ndelegates came from the Oneida tribe; they presented a\\r\\nletter written by the English authorities at Orange which\\r\\nassured the viceroy that the Mohawks were well disposed\\r\\nand wished for peace. A new treaty of ratification was\\r\\naccordingly signed. But the lieutenant-general wanted\\r\\nsomething more complete and decisive. He demanded of the\\r\\ndelegates a general treaty to include the whole of the\\r\\nFive Nations, and stated that he would allow forty days\\r\\nfor all the Iroquois tribes to send their ambassadors to\\r\\nQuebec. Moreover, he instructed Father Beschefer to go\\r\\nto Orange with some of the Oneida delegates for the\\r\\npurpose of meeting the ambassadors and escorting them to\\r\\nQuebec. Unfortunately, a few days after the priest\\'s\\r\\ndeparture, news came that four Frenchmen on a hunting\\r\\nexpedition had been killed near Fort Sainte-Anne by a\\r\\nparty of Mohawks, and that three others had been taken\\r\\nprisoners. One of the slain was a cousin of Tracy, and\\r\\none of the captives his nephew. Father Beschefer was at\\r\\nonce recalled and Captain de Sorel was ordered to march\\r\\nwith some two hundred Frenchmen and ninety Indians to\\r\\nstrike a blow at the raiders. Sorel lost no time and had\\r\\nnearly reached the enemy\\'s villages when he met Tracy\\'s\\r\\nnephew and the other prisoners under escort of an Iroquois\\r\\nchief and three warriors, who were bound for Quebec to\\r\\nmake amends for the treacherous murder recently perpetrated\\r\\nand to sue for peace. Under these circumstances Captain\\r\\nde Sorel did not think it necessary to proceed farther,\\r\\nand marched his men home again with the Iroquois and the\\r\\nrescued prisoners. On August 31 a great meeting was held\\r\\nat Quebec in the Jesuits\\' garden. The delegates of the\\r\\nFive Nations were present, and speeches were made enlarging\\r\\non the desirability of peace. But it soon became apparent\\r\\nthat no peace could be lasting except after a successful\\r\\nexpedition against the Mohawks. Tracy, Courcelle, and\\r\\nTalon held a consultation, and the intendant submitted\\r\\na well-prepared document in which he reviewed the reasons\\r\\nfor and against a continuance of the war. In Talon\\'s mind\\r\\nthe arguments in favour of it had undoubtedly the greater\\r\\nweight. Tracy and Courcelle concurred in this opinion.\\r\\nThirteen hundred men were drafted for an expedition\\xe2\\x80\\x94six\\r\\nhundred regular soldiers, six hundred Canadians, and a\\r\\nhundred Indians. All was soon ready, and on September\\r\\n14, the day of the Exaltation of the Cross, Tracy and\\r\\nCourcelle left Quebec, at the head of their troops. It\\r\\nwas a spectacle that did not fail to impress the Iroquois\\r\\nchiefs detained in Quebec. One of them, deeply moved,\\r\\nsaid to the viceroy: \\'I see that we are lost, but you\\r\\nwill pay dearly for your victory; my nation will be\\r\\nexterminated, but I tell you that many of your young men\\r\\nwill not return, for our young warriors will fight\\r\\ndesperately. I beg of you to save my wife and children.\\'\\r\\nMany who witnessed that martial exit of Tracy and Courcelle\\r\\nfrom the Chateau Saint-Louis, surrounded by a staff of\\r\\nnoble officers, must have realized that this was a\\r\\nmemorable day in the history of New France. At last a\\r\\ncrushing blow was to be struck at the ferocious foe who\\r\\nfor twenty-five years had been the curse and terror of\\r\\nthe wretched colony. What mighty cheers were shouted on\\r\\nthat day by the eager and enthusiastic spectators who\\r\\nlined the streets of Quebec!</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00039\">On September 28, the troops taking part in the expedition\\r\\nwere assembled at Fort Sainte-Anne. [Footnote: On isle\\r\\nLa Mothe at the northern end of Lake Champlain.] Charles\\r\\nLe Moyne commanded the Montreal contingent, one hundred\\r\\nand ten strong; the Quebec contingent marched under Le\\r\\nGardeur de Repentigny. Father Albanel and Father Raffeix,\\r\\nJesuit priests, the Abbe Dollier de Casson, a Sulpician,\\r\\nand the Abbe Dubois, chaplain of the Carignan regiment,\\r\\naccompanied the army. Three hundred light boats had been\\r\\nlaunched for the crossing of Lakes Champlain and\\r\\nSaint-Sacrement. Courcelle, always impetuous, was the\\r\\nfirst to leave the fort; he led a vanguard of four hundred\\r\\nmen which included those from Montreal. The main body of\\r\\nthe army under Tracy set out on October 3. Captains\\r\\nChambly and Berthier were to follow four days later with\\r\\nthe rear-guard.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00040\">The journey by water was uneventful; but the portage\\r\\nbetween the two lakes was hard and trying. Yet it was\\r\\nnothing compared with the difficulties of the march beyond\\r\\nLake Saint-Sacrement. One hundred miles of forest,\\r\\nmountains, rivers, and swamps lay between the troops and\\r\\nthe Iroquois villages. No roads existed, only narrow\\r\\nfootpaths interrupted by quagmires, bristling with stumps,\\r\\nobstructed by the entanglement of fallen trees, or abruptly\\r\\ncut by the foaming waters of swollen streams. Heavily\\r\\nladen, with arms, provisions, and ammunition strapped on\\r\\ntheir backs, French and Canadians slowly proceeded through\\r\\nthe great woods, whose autumnal glories were vanishing\\r\\nfast under the influence of the chill winds of October.\\r\\nSlipping over moist logs, sinking into unsuspected swamps,\\r\\nclimbing painfully over steep rocks, they went forward\\r\\nwith undaunted determination. At night they had to sleep\\r\\nin the open on a bed of damp leaves. The crossing of\\r\\nrivers was sometimes dangerous. Tracy, who unfortunately\\r\\nhad been seized with an attack of gout, was nearly drowned\\r\\nin one rapid stream. A Swiss soldier had undertaken to\\r\\ncarry him across on his shoulders, but his strength\\r\\nfailed, and if a rock had not stood near, the viceroy\\'s\\r\\ncareer might have ended there. A Huron came to the rescue\\r\\nand carried the helpless viceroy to the other side. The\\r\\nsufferings of the army were increased by a scarcity of\\r\\nfood. The troops were famishing. Luckily they came upon\\r\\nsome chestnut-trees and stayed their hunger with the nuts.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00041\">At last, on October 15, the scouts reported that the\\r\\nMohawk settlements were near at hand. It was late in the\\r\\nday, darkness was setting in, and a storm of wind and\\r\\nrain was raging. But Tracy decided to push on. They\\r\\nmarched all night, and in the morning, emerging from the\\r\\nwoods, saw before them the first of the Mohawk towns or\\r\\nvillages. Without allowing a moment\\'s pause, the viceroy\\r\\nordered an advance. The roll of the drums seemed to give\\r\\nthe troops new strength and ardour; French, Canadians,\\r\\nand Indians ran forward to the assault. The Mohawks,\\r\\napprised of the coming attack, had determined beforehand\\r\\nto make a stand and had sent their women and children to\\r\\nanother village. But, at the sight of the advancing army,\\r\\nwhose numbers appeared to them three times as great as\\r\\nthey really were, and at the sound of the drums, like\\r\\nthe voice of demons, they fled panic-stricken. The first\\r\\nvillage was taken without striking a blow. The viceroy\\r\\nimmediately ordered a march against the second, which\\r\\nwas also found abandoned. Evidently the Iroquois were\\r\\nterrified, for a third village was taken in the same way,\\r\\nwithout a show of defence. It was thought that the\\r\\ninvaders\\' task was finished, when an Algonquin squaw,\\r\\nonce a captive of the Iroquois, informed Courcelle that\\r\\nthere were two other villages. The soldiers pushed forward,\\r\\nand the fourth settlement of the ever-vanishing enemy\\r\\nfell undefended into the hands of the French. The sun\\r\\nwas setting; the exertions of the day and of the night\\r\\nbefore had been arduous, and it seemed impossible to go\\r\\nfarther. But the squaw, seizing a pistol and grasping\\r\\nCourcelle\\'s hand, said, \\'Come on, I will show you the\\r\\nstraight path.\\' And she led the way to the town and fort\\r\\nof Andaraque, the most important stronghold of the Mohawks.\\r\\nIt was surrounded with a triple palisade twenty feet high\\r\\nand flanked by four bastions. Vessels of bark full of\\r\\nwater were distributed on the platforms behind the palisade\\r\\nready for use against fire. The Iroquois might have made\\r\\na desperate stand there, and such had been their intention.\\r\\nBut their courage failed them at the fearful beating of\\r\\nthe drums and the appearance of that mighty army, and\\r\\nthey sought safety in flight.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00042\">The victory was now complete, and the army could go to\\r\\nrest after nearly twenty-four hours of continuous exertion.\\r\\nNext morning the French were astonished at the sight of\\r\\nAndaraque in the light of the rising sun. instead of a\\r\\ncollection of miserable wigwams, they saw a fine Indian\\r\\ntown, with wooden houses, some of them a hundred and\\r\\ntwenty feet long and with lodging for eight or nine\\r\\nfamilies. These houses were well supplied with provisions,\\r\\ntools, and utensils. An immense quantity of Indian corn\\r\\nand other necessaries was stored in Andaraque-\\'food enough\\r\\nto feed Canada for ten years\\'\\xe2\\x80\\x94and in the surrounding\\r\\nfields a plentiful crop was ready for harvest. All this\\r\\nwas to be destroyed; but first an impressive ceremony\\r\\nhad to be performed. The army was drawn up in battle\\r\\narray. A French officer, Jean-Baptiste Dubois, commander\\r\\nof the artillery, advanced, sword in hand, to the front,\\r\\nand in the presence of Tracy and Courcelle, declared that\\r\\nhe was directed by M. Jean Talon, king\\'s counsellor and\\r\\nintendant of justice, police, and finance for New France,\\r\\nto take possession of Andaraque, and of all the country\\r\\nof the Mohawks, in the name of the king. A cross was\\r\\nsolemnly planted alongside a post bearing the king\\'s coat\\r\\nof arms. Mass was celebrated and the Te Deum sung. Then\\r\\nthe work of destruction began. The palisades, the dwellings,\\r\\nthe bastions, the stores of grain and provisions, except\\r\\nwhat was needed by the invaders, the standing crops-all\\r\\nwere set on fire; and when night fell the glaring\\r\\nillumination of that tremendous blaze told the savages\\r\\nthat at last New France had asserted her power, and that\\r\\nthe soldiers of the great king had come far enough through\\r\\nforest and over mountain and stream to chastise in their\\r\\nown country the bloodthirsty tribes who for a quarter of\\r\\na century had been the terror of the growing settlements\\r\\non the St Lawrence.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00043\">On their return march the troops suffered great hardships.\\r\\nA storm on Lake Champlain upset two boats and eight men\\r\\nwere drowned. Tracy reached Quebec on November 5. The\\r\\nexpedition had lasted seven weeks, during which time he\\r\\nhad covered nine hundred miles. The news of his success\\r\\nhad been received with joy. Since the first days of\\r\\nOctober the whole colony had been praying for victory.\\r\\nAs soon as the destruction of the Iroquois towns was\\r\\nknown, prayers were changed to thanksgiving. The Te Deum\\r\\nwas solemnly chanted, and on November 14 a mass was said\\r\\nin the church of Notre-Dame-de-Quebec, followed by a\\r\\nprocession in gratiarum actionem. New France might well\\r\\nrejoice. A great result had been attained. True it was\\r\\nthat the Mohawks, panic-stricken, had not been met and\\r\\ncrushed. in a set encounter. None the less they had had\\r\\ntheir lesson. They had learned that distance and natural\\r\\nimpediments were no protection against the French. Their\\r\\ntowns were a heap of ashes, their fields were despoiled,\\r\\ntheir country was ruined. The fruit of that expedition\\r\\nwas to be eighteen years of peace for New France. Eighteen\\r\\nyears of peace after twenty-five years of murderous\\r\\nincursions! Was not that worth a Te Deum?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00044\">After his return Tracy ordered one of the Iroquois detained\\r\\nat Quebec to be hanged as a penalty for his share in the\\r\\nmurder of the French hunters. He then directed three\\r\\nother prisoners, the Flemish Batard [Footnote: A half-breed\\r\\nMohawk leader.] and two Oneida chiefs, to go and inform\\r\\ntheir respective tribes that he would give them four\\r\\nmonths to send hostages and make peace; otherwise he\\r\\nwould lead against them another expedition more calamitous\\r\\nfor their country than the first one. At length, in the\\r\\nmonth of July of the following year, ambassadors of the\\r\\nIroquois nations arrived at Quebec with a number of\\r\\nIroquois families who were to remain as hostages in the\\r\\ncolony. The chiefs asked that missionaries be sent to\\r\\nreside among their tribes. This petition was granted.\\r\\nNew France could now breathe freely. The hatchet was\\r\\nburied.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 id=\"id00045\" style=\"margin-top: 4em\">CHAPTER IV</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5 id=\"id00046\">A COLONIAL COLBERT</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00047\">Tracy had led a successful expedition against the Iroquois\\r\\nand coerced them into a lasting peace. He had seen order\\r\\nand harmony restored in the government of the colony.\\r\\nHis mission was over and he left Canada on August 28,\\r\\n1667, Courcelle remaining as governor and Talon as\\r\\nintendant. From that moment the latter, though second in\\r\\nrank, became really the first official of New France, if\\r\\nwe consider his work in its relation to the future welfare\\r\\nof the colony.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00048\">We have already seen something of his views for the\\r\\nadministration of New France. He would have it emancipated\\r\\nfrom the jurisdiction of the West India Company; he tried\\r\\nalso to impress on the king and his minister the\\r\\nadvisability of augmenting the population in order to\\r\\ndevelop the resources of the colony\\xe2\\x80\\x94in a word, he sought\\r\\nto lay the foundations of a flourishing state. Undoubtedly\\r\\nColbert wished to help and strengthen New France, but he\\r\\nseemed to think that Talon\\'s aim was too ambitious. In\\r\\none of his letters the intendant had gone the length of\\r\\nsubmitting a plan f or the acquisition of New Netherlands,\\r\\nwhich had been conquered by the English in 1664. He\\r\\nsuggested that, in the negotiations for peace between\\r\\nFrance, England, and Holland, Louis XIV might stipulate\\r\\nfor the restoration to Holland of its colony, and in the\\r\\nmeantime come to an understanding with the States-General\\r\\nfor its cession to France. Annexation to Canada would\\r\\nfollow. But Colbert thought that Talon was too bold. The\\r\\nintendant had spoken of New France as likely to become\\r\\na great kingdom. In answer, the minister said that the\\r\\nking saw many obstacles to the fulfilment of these\\r\\nexpectations. To create on the shores of the St Lawrence\\r\\nan important state would require much emigration from\\r\\nFrance, and it would not be wise to draw so many people\\r\\nfrom the kingdom\\xe2\\x80\\x94to \\'unpeople France for the purpose of\\r\\npeopling Canada.\\' Moreover if too many colonists came to\\r\\nCanada in one season, the area already under cultivation\\r\\nwould not produce enough to feed the increased population,\\r\\nand great hardship would follow. Evidently Colbert did\\r\\nnot here display his usual insight. Talon never had in\\r\\nmind the unpeopling of France. He meant simply that if\\r\\nthe home government would undertake to send out a few\\r\\nhundred settlers every year, the result would be the\\r\\ncreation of a strong and prosperous nation on the shores\\r\\nof the St Lawrence. The addition of five hundred immigrants\\r\\nannually during the whole period of Louis XIV\\'s reign\\r\\nwould have given Canada in 1700 a population of five\\r\\nhundred thousand. It was thought that the mother country\\r\\ncould not spare so many; and yet the cost in men to France\\r\\nof a single battle, the bloody victory of Senef in 1674,\\r\\nwas eight thousand French soldiers. The wars of Louis\\r\\nXIV killed ten times more men than the systematic\\r\\ncolonization of Canada would have taken from the mother\\r\\ncountry. The second objection raised by Colbert was no\\r\\nbetter founded than the first. Talon did not ask for the\\r\\nimmigration of more colonists than the country could\\r\\nfeed. But he rightly thought that with peace assured the\\r\\ncolony could produce food enough for a very numerous\\r\\npopulation, and that increase in production would speedily\\r\\nfollow increase in numbers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00049\">It must not be supposed that Colbert was indifferent to\\r\\nthe development of New France. No other minister of the\\r\\nFrench king did more for Canada. It was under his\\r\\nadministration that the strength which enabled the colony\\r\\nso long to survive its subsequent trials was acquired.\\r\\nBut Colbert was entangled in the intricacies of European\\r\\npolitics. Obliged to co-operate in ventures which in his\\r\\nheart he condemned, and which disturbed him in his work\\r\\nof financial and administrative reform, he yielded\\r\\nsometimes to the fear of weakening the trunk of the old\\r\\ntree by encouraging the growth of the young shoots.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00050\">Talon had to give in. But he did so in such a way as to\\r\\ngain his point in part. He wrote that he would speak no\\r\\nmore of the great establishment he had thought possible,\\r\\nsince the minister was of opinion that France had no\\r\\nexcess of population which could be used for the peopling\\r\\nof Canada. At the same time he insisted on the necessity\\r\\nof helping the colony, and assured Colbert that, could\\r\\nhe himself see Canada, he would be disposed to do his\\r\\nutmost for it, knowing that a new country cannot make\\r\\nits own way without being helped effectively at the\\r\\noutset. Talon\\'s tact and firmness of purpose had their\\r\\nreward, for the next year Colbert gave ample proof that\\r\\nhe understood Canada\\'s situation and requirements.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00051\">On the question of the West India Company also there was\\r\\nsome divergence of view between the minister and the\\r\\nintendant. As we have seen in a preceding chapter, Talon\\r\\nhad expressed his apprehension of the evils likely to\\r\\nspring from the wide privileges exercised by the company.\\r\\nBut this trading association was Colbert\\'s creation. He\\r\\nhad contended that the failure of the One Hundred Associates\\r\\nwas due to inherent weakness. The new one was stronger\\r\\nand could do better. Perhaps difficulties might arise in\\r\\nthe beginning on account of the inexperience and greed\\r\\nof some of the company\\'s agents, but with time the\\r\\nsituation would improve. It was not surprising that\\r\\nColbert should defend the company he had organized.\\r\\nNevertheless, on that point as on the other, Colbert\\r\\ncontrived to meet Talon half-way. The Indian trade, he\\r\\nsaid, would be opened to the colonists, and for one year\\r\\nthe company would grant freedom of trade generally to\\r\\nall the people of New France.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00052\">In connection with the rights of this company another\\r\\nquestion, affecting the finances, was soon to arise. By\\r\\nits charter the company was entitled to collect the\\r\\nrevenues of the colony; that is to say, the taxes levied\\r\\non the sale of beaver and moose skins. The tax on beaver\\r\\nskins was twenty-five per cent, called le droit du quart;\\r\\nthe tax on moose skins was two sous per pound, le droit\\r\\ndu dixieme. There was also the revenue obtained from the\\r\\nsale or farming out of the trading privileges at Tadoussac,\\r\\nla traite de Tadoussac. All these formed what was called\\r\\nle fonds du pays, the public fund, out of which were paid\\r\\nthe emoluments of the governor and the public officers,\\r\\nthe costs of the garrisons at Quebec, Montreal, and Three\\r\\nRivers, the grants to religious communities, and other\\r\\npermanent yearly disbursements. The company had the right\\r\\nto collect the taxes, but was obliged to pay the public\\r\\ncharges.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00053\">Writing to Colbert, Talon said he would have been greatly\\r\\npleased if, in addition to these rights, the king had\\r\\nretained the fiscal powers of the crown. He declared that\\r\\nthe taxes were productive, yet the company\\'s agent seemed\\r\\nvery reluctant to pay the public charges. Colbert, of\\r\\ncourse, decided that the company, in accordance with its\\r\\ncharter, was entitled to enjoy the fiscal rights upon\\r\\ncondition of defraying annually the ordinary public\\r\\nexpenditure of the country, as the company which preceded\\r\\nit had done. Immediately another point was raised. What\\r\\nshould be the amount of the public expenditure, or rather,\\r\\nto what figure should the company be allowed to reduce\\r\\nit? Talon maintained that the public charges defrayed by\\r\\nthe former company amounted to 48,950 livres. [Footnote:\\r\\nThe livre was equivalent to the later franc, about twenty\\r\\ncents of modern Canadian currency.] The company\\'s agent\\r\\ncontended that they amounted only to 29,200 livres and\\r\\nthat the sum of 48,950 livres was exorbitant, as it\\r\\nexceeded by 4000 livres the highest sum ever received\\r\\nfrom farming out the revenue. [Footnote: It was the\\r\\ncustom in New France to sell or farm out the revenues.\\r\\nInstead of collecting direct the fur taxes and the proceeds\\r\\nof the Tadoussac trade, the government granted the rights\\r\\nto a corporation or a private individual in return for\\r\\na fixed sum annually.] To this the intendant replied by\\r\\nsubmitting evidence that the rights were farmed out for\\r\\n50,000 livres in 1660 and in 1663; moreover, the rights\\r\\nwere more valuable now, for with the conclusion of peace\\r\\ntrade would prosper. In the end Colbert decided that the\\r\\nsum payable by the company should be 36,000 livres\\r\\nannually. The ordinary revenue of New France was thus\\r\\nfixed, and remained at that sum for many years.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00054\">It must not be supposed that this revenue was sufficient\\r\\nto meet all the expenses connected with the defence and\\r\\ndevelopment of the colony. There was an extraordinary\\r\\nfund provided by the king\\'s treasury and devoted to the\\r\\nmovement and maintenance of the troops, the payment of\\r\\ncertain special emoluments, the transport of new settlers,\\r\\nhorses, and sheep, the construction of forts, the purchase\\r\\nand shipment of supplies. In 1665 this extraordinary\\r\\nbudget amounted to 358,000 livres.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00055\">Talon\\'s energetic action on the question of the revenue\\r\\nwas inspired by his knowledge of the public needs. He\\r\\nknew that many things requiring money had to be done. A\\r\\nnew country like Canada could not be opened up for\\r\\nsettlement without expense, and he thought that the\\r\\ntraders who reaped the benefit of their monopoly should\\r\\npay their due share of the outlay.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00056\">We have already seen that Talon had begun the establishment\\r\\nof three villages in the vicinity of Quebec. Let us\\r\\nbriefly enumerate the principles which guided him in\\r\\nerecting these settlements. First of all, in deference\\r\\nto the king\\'s instructions relative to concentration, he\\r\\ncontrived to plant the new villages as near as possible\\r\\nto the capital, and evolved a plan which would group the\\r\\nsettlers about a central point and thus provide for their\\r\\nmutual help and defence. In pursuance of this plan he\\r\\nmade all his Charlesbourg land grants triangular, narrow\\r\\nat the head, wide at the base, so that the houses erected\\r\\nat the head were near each other and formed a square in\\r\\nthe centre of the settlement. In this arrangement there\\r\\nwas originality and good sense. After more than two\\r\\ncenturies, Talon\\'s idea remains stamped on the soil; and\\r\\nthe plans of the Charlesbourg villages as surveyed in\\r\\nour own days show distinctly the form of settlement\\r\\nadopted by the intendant.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00057\">Proper dwellings were made ready to receive the new-comers.\\r\\nThen Talon proceeded with the establishment of settlers.\\r\\nTo his great joy some soldiers applied for grants. He\\r\\nmade point of having skilled workmen, some, if possible,\\r\\nin each village\\xe2\\x80\\x94carpenters, shoemakers, masons, or other\\r\\nartisans, whose services would be useful to all. He tried\\r\\nalso to induce habitants of earlier date to join the new\\r\\nsettlements, where their experience would be a guide and\\r\\ntheir methods an object-lesson to beginners.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00058\">The grants were made on very generous terms, The soldiers\\r\\nand habitants, on taking possession of their land, received\\r\\na substantial supply of food and the tools necessary for\\r\\ntheir work. They were to be paid for clearing and tilling\\r\\nthe first two acres. In return each was bound by his deed\\r\\nto clear and prepare for cultivation during the three or\\r\\nfour following years another two acres, which could\\r\\nafterwards be allotted to an incoming settler. Talon\\r\\nproposed also that they should be bound to military\\r\\nservice. For each new-comer the king assumed the total\\r\\nexpense of clearing two acres, erecting a house, preparing\\r\\nand sowing the ground, and providing flour until a crop\\r\\nwas reaped\\xe2\\x80\\x94all on condition that the occupant should\\r\\nclear and cultivate two additional acres within three or\\r\\nfour years, presumably for allotment to the next new-comer.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00059\">Such were the broad lines of Talon\\'s colonization policy.\\r\\nBut to his mind it was not enough that he should make\\r\\nregulations and issue orders; he would set up a model\\r\\nfarm himself and thus be an example in his own person.\\r\\nHe bought land in the neighbourhood of the St Charles\\r\\nriver and had the ground cleared at his own expense. He\\r\\nerected thereon a large house, a barn, and other buildings;\\r\\nand, in course of time, his fine property, comprising\\r\\ncultivated fields, meadows, and gardens, and well stocked\\r\\nwith domestic animals, became a source of pride to him.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00060\">Under Talon\\'s wise direction and encouragement, the\\r\\nsettlement of the country progressed rapidly. Now that\\r\\nthey could work in safety, the colonists set themselves\\r\\nto the task of clearing new farms. In his Relation of\\r\\n1668 Father Le Mercier wrote: \\'It is fine to see new\\r\\nsettlements on each side of the St Lawrence for a distance\\r\\nof eighty leagues\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 The fear of aggression no longer\\r\\nprevents our farmers from encroaching on the forest and\\r\\nharvesting all kinds of grain, which the soil here grows\\r\\nas well as in France.\\' In the district of Montreal there\\r\\nwas great activity. It was during this period that the\\r\\nlands of Longue-Pointe, of Pointe-aux-Trembles, and of\\r\\nLachine were first cultivated. At the same time, along\\r\\nthe river Richelieu, in the vicinity of Forts Chambly\\r\\nand Sorel, officers and soldiers of the Carignan-Salieres\\r\\nregiment were beginning to settle. \\'These worthy gentlemen,\\'\\r\\nwrote Mother Marie de l\\'Incarnation, \\'are at work, with\\r\\nthe king\\'s permission, establishing new French colonies.\\r\\nThey live on their farm produce, for they have oxen,\\r\\ncows, and poultry.\\' A census taken in 1668 gave very\\r\\nsatisfactory figures. A year before there had been 11,448\\r\\nacres under cultivation. That year there were 15,649,\\r\\nand wheat production amounted to 130,979 bushels. Such\\r\\nresults were encouraging. What a change in three years!</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00061\">One of the commodities most needed in the colony was\\r\\nhemp, for making coarse cloth. Talon accordingly caused\\r\\nseveral acres to be sown with hemp. The seed was gathered\\r\\nand distributed among a number of farmers, on the\\r\\nunderstanding that they would bring back an equal quantity\\r\\nof seed next year. Then he took a very energetic step.\\r\\nHe seized all the thread in the shops and gave notice\\r\\nthat nobody could procure thread except in exchange for\\r\\nhemp. In a word, he created a monopoly of thread to\\r\\npromote the production of hemp; and the policy was\\r\\nsuccessful. In many other ways the intendant\\'s activity\\r\\nand zeal for the public good manifested themselves. He\\r\\nfavoured the development of the St Lawrence fisheries\\r\\nand encouraged some of the colonists to devote their\\r\\nlabour to them. Cod-fishing was attempted with good\\r\\nresults. Shipbuilding was another industry of his\\r\\nintroduction. In 1666, always desirous of setting an\\r\\nexample, he built a small craft of one hundred and twenty\\r\\ntons. Later, he had the gratification of informing Colbert\\r\\nthat a Canadian merchant was building a vessel for the\\r\\npurpose of fishing in the lower St Lawrence. During the\\r\\nfollowing year six or seven ships were built at Quebec.\\r\\nThe Relation of 1667 states that Talon \\'took pains to\\r\\nfind wood fit for shipbuilding, which has been begun by\\r\\nthe construction of a barge found very useful and of a\\r\\nbig ship ready to float.\\'</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00062\">In building and causing ships to be built the intendant\\r\\nhad in view the extension of the colony\\'s trade. One of\\r\\nhis schemes was to establish regular commercial intercourse\\r\\nbetween Canada, the West Indies, and France. The ships\\r\\nof La Rochelle, Dieppe, and Havre, after unloading at\\r\\nQuebec, would carry Canadian products to the French West\\r\\nIndies, where they would load cargoes of sugar for France.\\r\\nThe intendant, always ready to show the way, entered into\\r\\npartnership with a merchant and shipped to the West Indies\\r\\nsalmon, eels, salt and dried cod, peas, staves, fish-oil,\\r\\nplanks, and small masts much needed in the islands. The\\r\\nestablishment of commercial relations between Canada and\\r\\nthe West Indies was an event of no small moment. During\\r\\nthe following years this trade proved important. In 1670\\r\\nthree ships built at Quebec were sent to the islands with\\r\\ncargoes of fish, oil, peas, planks, barley, and flour.\\r\\nIn 1672 two ships made the same voyage; and in 1681\\r\\nTalon\\'s successor, the intendant Duchesneau, wrote to\\r\\nthe minister that every year since his arrival two vessels\\r\\nat least (in one year four) had left Quebec for the West\\r\\nIndies with Canadian products.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00063\">The intendant was a busy man. The scope of his activity\\r\\nincluded the discovery and development of mines. There\\r\\nhad been reports of finding lead at Gaspe, and the West\\r\\nIndia Company had made an unsuccessful search there. At\\r\\nBaie Saint-Paul below Quebec iron ore was discovered,\\r\\nand it was thought that copper and silver also would be\\r\\nfound at the same place. In 1667 Father Allouez returned\\r\\nfrom the upper Ottawa, bringing fragments of copper which\\r\\nhe had detached from stones on the shores of Lake Huron.\\r\\nEngineers sent by the intendant reported favourably of\\r\\nthe coal-mines in Cape Breton; the specimens tested were\\r\\ndeemed to be of very good quality. In this connection\\r\\nmay be mentioned a mysterious allusion in Talon\\'s\\r\\ncorrespondence to the existence of coal where none is\\r\\nnow to be found. In 1667 he wrote to Colbert that a\\r\\ncoal-mine had been discovered at the foot of the Quebec\\r\\nrock. \\'This coal,\\' he said, \\'is good enough for the forge.\\r\\nIf the test is satisfactory, I shall see that our vessels\\r\\ntake loads of it to serve as ballast. It would be a great\\r\\nhelp in our naval construction; we could then do without\\r\\nthe English coal.\\' Next year the intendant wrote again:\\r\\n\\'The coal-mine opened at Quebec, which originated in the\\r\\ncellar of a lower-town resident and is continued through\\r\\nthe cape under the Chateau Saint-Louis, could not be\\r\\nworked, I fear, without imperilling the stability of the\\r\\nchateau. However, I shall try to follow another direction;\\r\\nfor, notwithstanding the excellent mine at Cape Breton,\\r\\nit would be a capital thing for the ships landing at\\r\\nQuebec to find coal here.\\' Is there actually a coal-mine\\r\\nat Quebec hidden in the depth of the rock which bears\\r\\nnow on its summit Dufferin Terrace and the Chateau\\r\\nFrontenac? We have before us Talon\\'s official report. He\\r\\nasserts positively that coal was found there\\xe2\\x80\\x94coal which\\r\\nwas tested, which burned well in the forge. What has\\r\\nbecome of the mine, and where is that coal? Nobody at\\r\\nthe present day has ever heard of a coal-mine at Quebec,\\r\\nand the story seems incredible. But Talon\\'s letter is\\r\\nexplicit. No satisfactory explanation has yet been\\r\\nsuggested, and we confess inability to offer one here.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00064\">While reviewing the great intendant\\'s activities, we must\\r\\nnot fail to mention the brewing industry in which he took\\r\\nthe lead. In 1668 he erected a brewery near the river St\\r\\nCharles, on the spot at the foot of the hill where stood\\r\\nin later years the intendant\\'s palace. He meant in this\\r\\nway to help the grain-growers by taking part of their\\r\\nsurplus product, and also to do something to check the\\r\\nincreasing importation of spirits which caused so much\\r\\ntrouble and disorder. However questionable the efficacy\\r\\nof beer in promoting temperance, Talon\\'s object is worthy\\r\\nof applause. Three years later the intendant wrote that\\r\\nhis brewery was capable of turning out two thousand\\r\\nhogsheads of beer for exportation to the West Indies and\\r\\ntwo thousand more for home consumption. To do this it\\r\\nwould require over twelve thousand bushels of grain\\r\\nannually, and would be a great support to the farmers.\\r\\nIn the mean-time he had planted hops on his farm and was\\r\\nraising good crops.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00065\">Talon\\'s buoyant reports and his incessant entreaties for\\r\\na strong and active colonial policy could not fail to\\r\\nenlist the sympathy of two such statesmen as Louis XIV\\r\\nand Colbert. This is perhaps the only period in earlier\\r\\nCanadian history during which the home government steadily\\r\\nfollowed a wise and energetic policy of developing and\\r\\nstrengthening the colony. We have seen that Colbert\\r\\nhesitated at first to encourage emigration, but he had\\r\\nyielded somewhat before Talon\\'s urgent representations,\\r\\nand from 1665 to 1671 there was an uninterrupted influx\\r\\nof Canadian settlers. It is recorded in a document written\\r\\nby Talon himself that in 1665 the West India Company\\r\\nbrought to Canada for the king\\'s account 429 men and 100\\r\\nyoung women, and 184 men and 92 women in 1667. During\\r\\nthese seven years there were in all 1828 state-aided\\r\\nimmigrants to Canada. The young women were carefully\\r\\nselected, and it was the king\\'s wish that they should\\r\\nmarry promptly, in order that the greatest possible number\\r\\nof new families should be founded. As a matter of fact,\\r\\nthe event was in accordance with the king\\'s wish. In 1665\\r\\nMother Marie de l\\'Incarnation wrote that the hundred\\r\\ngirls arrived that year were nearly all provided with\\r\\nhusbands. In 1667 she wrote again: \\'This pear ninety-two\\r\\ngirls came from France and they are already married to\\r\\nsoldiers and labourers.\\' In 1670 one hundred and fifty\\r\\ngirls arrived, and Talon wrote on November 10: \\'All the\\r\\ngirls who came this year are married, except fifteen whom\\r\\nI have placed in well-known families to await the time\\r\\nwhen the soldiers who sought them for their wives are\\r\\nestablished and able to maintain them.\\' It was indeed a\\r\\nmatrimonial period, and it is not surprising that marriage\\r\\nwas the order of the day. Every incentive to that end\\r\\nwas brought to bear. The intendant gave fifty livres in\\r\\nhousehold supplies and some provisions to each young\\r\\nwoman who contracted marriage. According to the king\\'s\\r\\ndecree, each youth who married at or before the age of\\r\\ntwenty was entitled to a gift of twenty livres, called\\r\\n\\'the king\\'s gift.\\' The same decree imposed a penalty upon\\r\\nall fathers who had not married their sons at twenty and\\r\\ntheir daughters at sixteen. In the same spirit, it enacted\\r\\nalso that all Canadians having ten children living should\\r\\nbe entitled to a pension of three hundred livres annually;\\r\\nfour hundred livres was the reward for twelve. \\'Marry\\r\\nearly\\' was the royal mandate. Colbert, writing to Talon\\r\\nin 1668, says: \\'I pray you to commend it to the\\r\\nconsideration of the whole people, that their prosperity,\\r\\ntheir subsistence, and all that is dear to them, depend\\r\\non a general resolution, never to be departed from, to\\r\\nmarry youths at eighteen or nineteen years and girls at\\r\\nfourteen or fifteen; since abundance can never come to\\r\\nthem except through the abundance of men.\\' And this was\\r\\nnot enough; Colbert went on: \\'Those who may seem to have\\r\\nabsolutely renounced marriage should be made to bear\\r\\nadditional burdens, and be excluded from all honours; it\\r\\nwould be well even to add some mark of infamy.\\' The\\r\\nunfortunate bachelor seems to have been treated somewhat\\r\\nas a public malefactor. Talon issued an order forbidding\\r\\nunmarried volontaires to hunt with the Indians or go into\\r\\nthe woods, if they did not marry fifteen days after the\\r\\narrival of the ships from France. And a case is recorded\\r\\nof one Francois Lenoir, of Montreal, who was brought\\r\\nbefore the judge because, being unmarried, he had gone\\r\\nto trade with the Indians. He pleaded guilty, and pledged\\r\\nhimself to marry next year after the arrival of the ships,\\r\\nor failing that, to give one hundred and fifty livres to\\r\\nthe church of Montreal and a like sum to the hospital.\\r\\nHe kept his money and married within the term.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00066\">The matrimonial zeal of Colbert and Talon did not slight\\r\\nthe noblemen and officers. Captain de la Mothe, marrying\\r\\nand taking up his abode in the country, received sixteen\\r\\nhundred livres. During the years 1665-68 six thousand\\r\\nlivres were expended to aid the marriage of young\\r\\ngentlewomen without means, and six thousand to enable\\r\\nfour captains, three lieutenants, five ensigns, and a\\r\\nfew minor officers to settle and marry in the colony.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00067\">A word must be said as to the character of the young\\r\\nwomen. Some writers have cast unfair aspersions upon the\\r\\ngirls sent out from France to marry in Canada. After a\\r\\nserious study of the question, we are in a position to\\r\\nstate that these girls were most carefully selected. Some\\r\\nof them were orphans reared in charitable institutions\\r\\nunder the king\\'s protection; they were called les filles\\r\\ndu roi. The rest belonged to honest families, and their\\r\\nparents, overburdened with children, were willing to send\\r\\nthem to a new country where they would be well provided\\r\\nfor. In 1670 Colbert wrote to the archbishop of Rouen:\\r\\n\\'As in the parishes about Rouen fifty or sixty girls\\r\\nmight be found who would be very glad to go to Canada to\\r\\nbe married, I beg you to employ your credit and authority\\r\\nwith the cures of thirty or forty of these parishes, to\\r\\ntry to find in each of them one or two girls disposed to\\r\\ngo voluntarily for the sake of settlement in life.\\' Such\\r\\nwas the quality of the female emigration to Canada. The\\r\\ngirls were drawn from reputable institutions, or from\\r\\ngood peasant families, under the auspices of the cures.\\r\\nDuring their journey to Canada they were under the care\\r\\nand direction of persons highly respected for their\\r\\nvirtues and piety, such as Madame Bourdon, widow of the\\r\\nlate attorney-general of New France, or Mademoiselle\\r\\nEtienne, who was appointed governess of the girls leaving\\r\\nfor Canada by the directors of the general hospital of\\r\\nParis. When young women arrived in Canada, they were\\r\\neither immediately married or placed for a time in good\\r\\nfamilies.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00068\">The paternal policy of the minister and the intendant\\r\\nwas favoured by the disbanding of the Carignan companies.\\r\\nIn 1668 the regiment was recalled to France; four companies\\r\\nonly were left in Canada to garrison the forts. The\\r\\nofficers and soldiers of the companies withdrawn were\\r\\nentreated to remain as settlers, and about four hundred\\r\\ndecided to make their home in Canada. They were generously\\r\\nsubsidized. Each soldier electing to settle in the colony\\r\\nreceived one hundred livres, or fifty livres with provisions\\r\\nfor one year, at his choice. Each sergeant received one\\r\\nhundred and fifty livres, or one hundred livres with one\\r\\nyear\\'s provisions. The officers also were given liberal\\r\\nendowments. Among them were: Captains de Contrecoeur, de\\r\\nSaint-Ours, de Sorel, Dugue de Boisbriant, Lieutenants\\r\\nGaultier de Varennes and Margane de la Valtrie; Ensigns\\r\\nPaul Dupuis, Becard de Grandville, Pierre Monet de Moras,\\r\\nFrancois Jarret de Vercheres.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00069\">The strenuous efforts of Colbert and Talon could not but\\r\\ngive a great impulse to population. The increase was\\r\\nnoticeable. In November 1671 Talon wrote:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00070\" style=\"margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%\">   His Majesty will see by the extracts of the registers\\r\\n   of baptisms that the number of children this year is\\r\\n   six or seven hundred; and in the coming years we may\\r\\n   hope for a substantial increase. There is some reason\\r\\n   to believe that, without any further female immigration,\\r\\n   the country will see more than one hundred marriages\\r\\n   next year. I consider it unnecessary to send girls\\r\\n   next year; the better to give the habitants a chance\\r\\n   to marry their own girls to soldiers desirous of\\r\\n   settling. Neither will it be necessary to send young\\r\\n   ladies, as we received last year fifteen, instead of\\r\\n   the four who were needed for wives of officers and\\r\\n   notables.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00071\">In a former chapter the population of Canada in 1665 was\\r\\ngiven as 3215 souls, and the number of families 533. In\\r\\n1668 the number of families was 1139 and the population\\r\\n6282. In three years the population had nearly doubled\\r\\nand the number of families had more than doubled.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00072\">Other statistics may fittingly be given here. During the\\r\\nperiod under consideration, the West India Company sent\\r\\nto Canada for the king\\'s account many horses and sheep.\\r\\nThese were badly needed in the colony. Since its first\\r\\nsettlement there had been seen in New France only a single\\r\\nhorse, one which had been presented by the Company of\\r\\nOne Hundred Associates to M. de Montmagny, the governor\\r\\nwho succeeded Champlain. But from 1665 to 1668 forty-one\\r\\nmares and stallions and eighty sheep were brought from\\r\\nFrance. Domestic animals continued to be introduced until\\r\\n1672. Fourteen horses and fifty sheep were sent in 1669,\\r\\nthirteen horses in 1670, the same number of horses and\\r\\na few asses in 1671. So that during these seven years\\r\\nCanada received from France about eighty horses. Twenty\\r\\nyears afterwards, in 1692, there were four hundred horses\\r\\nin the colony. In 1698 there were six hundred and\\r\\neighty-four; and in 1709 the number had so increased that\\r\\nthe intendant Raudot issued an ordinance to restrain the\\r\\nmultiplication of these animals.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00073\">From what has been said it will be seen that this period\\r\\nof Canadian history was one of great progress. What\\r\\nColbert was to France Talon was to New France. While the\\r\\ngreat minister, in the full light of European publicity,\\r\\nwas gaining fame as a financial reformer and the reviver\\r\\nof trade and industry, the sagacious and painstaking\\r\\nintendant in his remote corner of the globe was laying\\r\\nthe foundations of an economic and political system, and\\r\\nopening to the young country the road of commercial,\\r\\nindustrial, and maritime progress. Talon was a colonial\\r\\nColbert. What the latter did in a wide sphere and with\\r\\nample means, the former was trying to do on a small scale\\r\\nand with limited resources. Both have deserved a place\\r\\nof honour in Canadian annals.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 id=\"id00074\" style=\"margin-top: 4em\">CHAPTER V</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5 id=\"id00075\">THE INTENDANT AND THE SOVEREIGN COUNCIL</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00076\">In the preceding chapter a sketch has been given of\\r\\nTalon\\'s endeavours to promote colonization, agriculture,\\r\\nshipbuilding, and commerce, to increase the population,\\r\\nand to foster generally the prosperity of New France.\\r\\nLet us now see how he provided for the good administration\\r\\nand internal order of the colony.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00077\">In 1666 he had prepared and submitted to Tracy and\\r\\nCourcelle a series of rules and enactments relating to\\r\\nvarious important matters, one of which was the\\r\\nadministration of justice. Talon wished to simplify the\\r\\nprocedure; to make justice speedy, accessible to all,\\r\\nand inexpensive. In each parish he proposed to establish\\r\\njudges having the power to hear and decide in the first\\r\\ninstance all civil cases involving not more than ten\\r\\nlivres. In addition, there would be four judges at Quebec,\\r\\nand appeals might be taken before three of them from all\\r\\ndecisions given by the local judges\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\'unless,\\' Talon\\r\\nadded, \\'it be thought more advisable to maintain the\\r\\nSieur Chartier in his charge of lieutenant-general, to\\r\\nwhich he has been appointed by the West India Company.\\'\\r\\nIt was decided that M. Chartier (de Lotbiniere) should\\r\\nbe so maintained, and he was duly confirmed as lieutenant\\r\\ncivil et criminel on January 10, 1667. He had jurisdiction\\r\\nin the first instance over all cases civil and criminal\\r\\nin the Quebec district and in appeal from the judgments\\r\\nof the local or seigneurial judges. The Sovereign Council\\r\\nacted as a court of appeal in the last resort, except in\\r\\ncases where the parties made a supreme appeal to the\\r\\nKing\\'s Council of State in France. In 1669 Talon wrote\\r\\na memorandum in which we find these words: \\'Justice is\\r\\nadministered in the first instance by judges in the\\r\\nseigneuries; then by a lieutenant civil and criminal\\r\\nappointed by the company in each of the jurisdictions of\\r\\nQuebec and Three Rivers; and above all by the Sovereign\\r\\nCouncil, which in the last instance decides all cases\\r\\nwhere an appeal lies.\\' At Montreal there was a lieutenant\\r\\ncivil and criminal appointed by the Sulpicians, seigneurs\\r\\nof the island. In 1667 there were seigneurial judges in\\r\\nthe seigneuries of Beaupre, Beauport, Notre-Dame-des-Anges,\\r\\nCap-de-la-Magdeleine.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00078\">It is interesting to find that Talon attempted to establish\\r\\na method of settlement out of court, the principle of\\r\\nwhich was accepted by the legislature of the province of\\r\\nQuebec more than two centuries later. What was called\\r\\nthe amiable composition of the French intendant may be\\r\\nregarded as a first edition of the law passed at Quebec\\r\\nin 1899, which provides for conciliation or arbitration\\r\\nproceedings before a lawsuit is begun. [Footnote: 62\\r\\nVict. cap. 54, p. 271.] Talon also introduced an equitable\\r\\nsystem of land registration.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00079\">In the proceedings of the Sovereign Council, of which\\r\\nTalon at this time was the inspiring mind, we may see\\r\\nreflected the condition and internal life of the colony.\\r\\nDecrees for the regulation of trade were frequent.\\r\\nCommercial freedom was unknown. Under the administration\\r\\nof the governor Avaugour (1661-63) a tariff of prices\\r\\nhad been published, which the merchants were compelled\\r\\nto observe. Again, in 1664 the council had decided that\\r\\nthe merchants might charge fifty-five per cent above cost\\r\\nprice on dry goods, one hundred per cent on the more\\r\\nexpensive wines and spirits, and one hundred and twenty\\r\\nper cent on the cheaper, the cost price in France being\\r\\ndetermined by the invoice-bills. In 1666 a new tariff\\r\\nwas enacted by the council, in which the price of one\\r\\nhogshead of Bordeaux wine was fixed at eighty livres,\\r\\nand that of Brazil tobacco at forty sous a pound. In 1667\\r\\nagain changes took place: on dry goods the merchants were\\r\\nallowed seventy per cent above cost; on spirits and wines,\\r\\none hundred or one hundred and twenty per cent as in\\r\\n1664. The merchants did not accept these rulings without\\r\\nprotest. In 1664 the most important Quebec trader, Charles\\r\\nAubert de la Chesnaye, was prosecuted for contravention,\\r\\nand made this bold declaration in favour of commercial\\r\\nfreedom: \\'I have always deemed that I had a right to the\\r\\nfree disposal of my own, especially when I consider that\\r\\nI spend in the colony what I earn therein.\\' Prosecutions\\r\\nfor violating the law were frequent. During the month of\\r\\nJune 1667, at a sitting of the Sovereign Council, Tracy,\\r\\nCourcelle, Talon, and Laval being present, the attorney-\\r\\ngeneral Bourdon made out a case against Jacques de la\\r\\nMothe, a merchant, for having sold wines and tobacco at\\r\\nhigher prices than those of the tariff. The defendant\\r\\nacknowledged that he had sold his wine at one hundred\\r\\nlivres and his tobacco at sixty sous, but alleged that\\r\\nhis wine was the best Bordeaux, that his hogsheads had\\r\\na capacity of fully one hundred and twenty pots, that\\r\\ncare, risk, and leakage should be taken into consideration,\\r\\nthat two hogsheads had been spoiled, and that the price\\r\\nof those remaining should be higher to compensate him\\r\\nfor their loss. As to the tobacco, it was of the Maragnan\\r\\nquality, and he had always deemed it impossible to sell\\r\\nit for less than sixty sous. After hearing the case, the\\r\\ncouncil decided that two of its members, Messieurs Damours\\r\\nand de la Tesserie, should make an inspection at La\\r\\nMothe\\'s store, in order to taste his wine and tobacco\\r\\nand gauge his hogsheads. Away they went; and afterwards\\r\\nthey made their report. Finally La Mothe was condemned\\r\\nto a fine of twenty-two livres, payable to the Hotel-Dieu.\\r\\nIt may be remarked here that very often the fines had a\\r\\nsimilar destination; in that way justice helped charity.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00080\">The magistrates were vigilant, but the merchants were\\r\\ncunning and often succeeded in evading the tariff. In\\r\\nJuly 1667, the habitants\\' syndic appeared before the\\r\\ncouncil to complain of the various devices resorted to\\r\\nby merchants to extort higher prices from the settlers\\r\\nthan were allowed by law. So the council made a ruling\\r\\nthat all merchandise should be stamped, in the presence\\r\\nof the syndic, according to the prices of each kind and\\r\\nquality, and ordered samples duly stamped in this way to\\r\\nbe delivered to commissioners specially appointed for\\r\\nthe purpose. It will be seen that these regulations were\\r\\nminute and severe. Trade was thus submitted to stern\\r\\nrestrictions which would seem strange and unbearable in\\r\\nthese days of freedom. What an outcry there would be if\\r\\nparliament should attempt now to dictate to our merchants\\r\\nthe selling price of their merchandise! But in the\\r\\nseventeenth century such a thing was common enough. It\\r\\nwas a time of extreme official interference in private\\r\\naffairs and transactions.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00081\">We have mentioned the syndic of the inhabitants\\xe2\\x80\\x94syndic\\r\\ndes habitants. A word about this officer will be in place\\r\\nhere. He was the spokesman of the community when complaints\\r\\nhad to be made or petitions presented to the governor or\\r\\nthe Sovereign Council. At that time in Canada there was\\r\\nno municipal government. True, an unlucky experiment had\\r\\nbeen made in 1663, under the governor Mezy, when a mayor\\r\\nand two aldermen were elected at Quebec. But their\\r\\nenjoyment of office was of brief duration; in a few weeks\\r\\nthe election was declared void, It was then determined\\r\\nto nominate a syndic to represent the inhabitants, and\\r\\non August 3 Claude Charron, a merchant, was elected to\\r\\nthe office; but, as the habitants often had difficulties\\r\\nto settle with members of the commercial class, objection\\r\\nwas taken to him on the ground that he was a tradesman,\\r\\nand he retired. On September 17 a new election took place,\\r\\nand Jean Le Mire, a carpenter, was elected. Later on,\\r\\nduring the troubles of the Mezy regime, the office seems\\r\\nto have been practically abolished; but when the government\\r\\nwas reorganized, it was thought advisable to revive it.\\r\\nThe council decreed another election, and on March 20,\\r\\n1667, Jean Le Mire was again chosen as syndic. Le Mire\\r\\ncontinued to hold the office for many years.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00082\">To the colony of that day the Sovereign Council was,\\r\\nbroadly speaking, what the legislatures, the executives,\\r\\nthe courts of justice, and the various commissions\\xe2\\x80\\x94all\\r\\ncombined\\xe2\\x80\\x94are to modern Canada. But, as we have seen, it\\r\\nhad arbitrary powers that these modern bodies are not\\r\\npermitted to exercise. Its long arm reached into every\\r\\nconcern of the inhabitants. In 1667, for example, the\\r\\nhabitants asked for a regulation to fix the millers\\'\\r\\nfee\\xe2\\x80\\x94the amount of the toll to which they would be entitled\\r\\nfor grinding the grain. The owners of the flour-mills\\r\\nrepresented that the construction, repair, and maintenance\\r\\nof their mills were two or three times more costly in\\r\\nCanada than in France, and that they should have a\\r\\nproportionate fee; still, they would be willing to accept\\r\\nthe bare remuneration usually allowed in the kingdom.\\r\\nThe toll was fixed at one-fourteenth of the grain. Highways\\r\\nwere also under the care of the council. When the residents\\r\\nof a locality presented a petition for opening a road,\\r\\nthe council named two of its members to make an inspection\\r\\nand report. On receipt of the report, an order would be\\r\\nissued for opening a road along certain lines and of a\\r\\nspecified width (it was often eighteen feet), and for\\r\\npulling stumps and filling up hollows. There was an\\r\\nofficial called the grand-voyer, or general overseer of\\r\\nroads. The office had been established in 1657, when Rene\\r\\nRobineau de Becancourt was appointed grand-voyer by the\\r\\nCompany of One Hundred Associates. But in the wretched\\r\\nstate of the colony at that time M. de Becancourt had\\r\\nnot much work to do. In later years, however, the usefulness\\r\\nof a grand-voyer had become more apparent, and Becancourt\\r\\nasked for a confirmation of his appointment. On the\\r\\nsuggestion of Talon, the council reinstated him and\\r\\nordered that his commission be registered. During the\\r\\nwhole French regime there were but five general overseers\\r\\nof roads or grands-voyers: Rene Robineau de Becancourt\\r\\n(1657-99); Pierre Robineau de Becancourt (1699-1729); E.\\r\\nLanoullier de Boisclerc (1731-51); M. de la Gorgendiere\\r\\n(1751-59); M. de Lino (1759-60).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00083\">Guardianship of public morality and the maintenance of\\r\\npublic order were the chief cares of the council. It was\\r\\never intent on the suppression of vice. On August 20,\\r\\n1667, in the presence of Tracy, Courcelle, Talon, and\\r\\nLaval, the attorney-general submitted information of\\r\\nscandalous conduct on the part of some women and girls,\\r\\nand represented that a severe punishment would be a\\r\\nwholesome warning to all evil-doers; he also suggested\\r\\nthat the wife of Sebastien Langelier, being one of the\\r\\nmost disorderly, should be singled out for an exemplary\\r\\npenalty. A councillor was immediately appointed to\\r\\ninvestigate the case. What was done in this particular\\r\\ninstance is not recorded, but there is evidence to show\\r\\nthat licentious conduct was often severely dealt with.\\r\\nCrimes and misdemeanours were ruthlessly pursued. For a\\r\\ntheft committed at night in the Hotel-Dieu garden, the\\r\\nintendant condemned a man to be marked with the\\r\\nfleur-de-lis, to be exposed for four hours in the pillory,\\r\\nand to serve three years in the galleys. Another culprit\\r\\nconvicted of larceny was sentenced to be publicly whipped\\r\\nand to serve three years in the galleys. Both these\\r\\nprisoners escaped and returned to their former practices.\\r\\nThey were recaptured and sentenced, the first to be\\r\\nhanged, the second to be whipped, marked with the\\r\\nfleur-de-lis, and kept in irons until further order. Rape\\r\\nin the colony was unhappily frequent. A man convicted of\\r\\nthis crime was condemned to death and executed two days\\r\\nlater. Another was whipped till the blood flowed and\\r\\ncondemned to serve nine years in the galleys.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00084\">Let us now turn to activities of another order. One of\\r\\nthe most important ordinances enacted by the Sovereign\\r\\nCouncil under Talon\\'s direction was that which concerned\\r\\nthe importation of spirits and the establishment in the\\r\\ncolony of the brewing industry. It was stated in this\\r\\ndecree that the great quantity of brandies and wines\\r\\nimported from France was a cause of debauchery. Many were\\r\\ndiverted from productive work, their health was ruined,\\r\\nthey were induced to squander their money, and prevented\\r\\nfrom buying necessaries and supplies useful for the\\r\\ndevelopment of the colony. Talon, as we have read in\\r\\nanother chapter, thought that one of the best means of\\r\\ncombating the immoderate use of spirits was the setting\\r\\nup of breweries; at the same time he intended that this\\r\\nindustry should help agriculture. The Sovereign Council\\r\\nentered into these views and enacted that as soon as\\r\\nbreweries should be in operation in Canada all importation\\r\\nof wines and spirits should be prohibited, except by\\r\\nspecial permission and subject to a tax of five hundred\\r\\nlivres, payable one-third to the seigneurs of the country,\\r\\none-third to the Hotel-Dieu, and one-third to the person\\r\\nwho had set up the first brewery after the date of the\\r\\nenactment. Under no circumstances should the yearly\\r\\nimportation exceed eight hundred hogsheads of wine and\\r\\nfour hundred of brandy. When this amount had been reached,\\r\\nno further licences to import would be issued. The council\\r\\nbegged Talon to take the necessary steps for the\\r\\nconstruction and equipment of one or more breweries. The\\r\\nowners of these were to have, during ten years, the\\r\\nexclusive privilege of brewing for trading purposes. The\\r\\nprice of beer was fixed beforehand at twenty livres per\\r\\nhogshead and six sous per pot so long as barley was priced\\r\\nat three livres per bushel or less; if the price of barley\\r\\nwent higher, the price of beer should be raised\\r\\nproportionately.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00085\">In 1667 the Sovereign Council\\xe2\\x80\\x94inspired by Talon\\xe2\\x80\\x94had to\\r\\ndiscuss a very important question. This was the formation\\r\\nof a company of Canadians to secure the exclusive privilege\\r\\nof trading. By its charter, the West India Company had\\r\\nbeen granted the commercial monopoly. Under pressure from\\r\\nTalon it had somewhat abated its pretensions and had\\r\\nallowed freedom of trade for a time. But again it was\\r\\nurging its rights. The council asked the intendant to\\r\\nsupport with his influence at court the plan for a Canadian\\r\\ncompany, which he did. Colbert did not say no; neither\\r\\ndid he seem in a hurry to grant the request. In 1668 the\\r\\ncouncil sent the minister a letter praying for freedom\\r\\nof trade. This year the company had enforced its monopoly\\r\\nand the people had suffered from the lack of necessaries,\\r\\nwhich could not be found in the company\\'s stores; moreover,\\r\\nprices were exceedingly high. Such a state of things was\\r\\ndetrimental to the colony. The council begged that, if\\r\\nColbert were not disposed to grant freedom of trade, he\\r\\nwould favourably consider the scheme for a trading company\\r\\ncomposed of Canadians, which had been submitted to him\\r\\nthe year before. We shall see, later on, what came of\\r\\nthis agitation against the West India Company.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00086\">The good understanding between the intendant and the\\r\\nSovereign Council was absolute. The council had shown\\r\\nunequivocal confidence in Talon\\'s ability and respect\\r\\nfor his person and authority. A few days before the\\r\\nMarquis de Tracy had left the colony the council had\\r\\nordered that all petitions to enter lawsuits should be\\r\\npresented to the intendant, who should assign them to\\r\\nthe council or to the lieutenant civil and criminal, or\\r\\ntry them himself, at his discretion. This was treating\\r\\nTalon as the supreme magistrate and acknowledging him as\\r\\nthe dispenser of justice. M. de Courcelle, who was\\r\\nbeginning to feel some uneasiness at Talon\\'s great\\r\\nauthority and prestige, refused to sign the proceedings\\r\\nof that day, inscribing these lines in the council\\'s\\r\\nregister: \\'This decree being against the governor\\'s\\r\\nauthority and the public good, I did not wish to sign\\r\\nit.\\' At the beginning of the following year Talon, whose\\r\\nattention perhaps had not been called to Courcelle\\'s\\r\\nwritten protest, requested the adoption of a similar\\r\\ndecree; and the council did not hesitate to confirm its\\r\\nprevious decision, notwithstanding the governor\\'s former\\r\\nopposition, which he reiterated in the same terms.\\r\\nCourcelle was certainly mistaken in supposing that the\\r\\ncouncil\\'s decision was an encroachment on his authority.\\r\\nThe superior jurisdiction in judicial matters belonged\\r\\nto the intendant. Under his commission he had the right\\r\\nto \\'judge alone and with full jurisdiction in civil\\r\\nmatters,\\' to \\'hear all cases of crimes and misdemeanours,\\r\\nabuse and malversation, by whomsoever committed,\\' to\\r\\n\\'proceed against all persons guilty of any crime, whatever\\r\\nmight be their quality or condition, to pursue the\\r\\nproceedings until final completion, judgment and execution\\r\\nthereof.\\' Nevertheless, in practice and with due regard\\r\\nto the good administration of justice, the council\\'s\\r\\ndecree went perhaps too far. The question remained in\\r\\nabeyance and was not settled until four years afterwards,\\r\\nat the end of Talon\\'s second term in Canada. He had\\r\\nwritten to Colbert on the subject stating that he would\\r\\nbe glad to be discharged of the judicial responsibility,\\r\\nand to see the question of initiating lawsuits referred\\r\\nto the Sovereign Council.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00087\" style=\"margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%\">   As a matter of fact [he said], receiving the petitions\\r\\n   for entering lawsuits does not mean retaining them\\r\\n   before myself. I have not judged twenty cases, civil\\r\\n   or criminal, since I came here, having always tried\\r\\n   as much as I could to conciliate the opposing parties.\\r\\n   The reason why I speak now of this matter is that very\\r\\n   often, for twenty or thirty livres of principal, a\\r\\n   plaintiff goes before the judge of first instance\\xe2\\x80\\x94which\\r\\n   diverts the parties from the proper cultivation of\\r\\n   their farms\\xe2\\x80\\x94and later on, by way of an appeal, before\\r\\n   the Sovereign Council which likes to hear and judge\\r\\n   cases.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00088\">Colbert did not deem the decision of the council advisable.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00089\" style=\"margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%\">   It is contrary [he wrote] to the order of justice, in\\r\\n   virtue of which, leaving in their own sphere the\\r\\n   superior judges, the judges of first instance are\\r\\n   empowered to hear all cases within their jurisdiction,\\r\\n   and their judgments can be appealed from to the\\r\\n   Sovereign Council. Moreover it would be a burden for\\r\\n   the king\\'s subjects living far from Quebec to go there\\r\\n   unnecessarily in order to ascertain before what tribunal\\r\\n   they should be heard.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00090\">We must now speak of a most important matter\\xe2\\x80\\x94the brandy\\r\\ntraffic. The sale of intoxicating liquor to the Indians\\r\\nhad always been prohibited in the colony. In 1657 a decree\\r\\nof the King\\'s State Council had ratified and renewed this\\r\\nprohibition under pain of corporal punishment. Yet,\\r\\nnotwithstanding the decree, greedy traders broke the law\\r\\nand, for the purpose of getting furs at a low price,\\r\\nsupplied the Indians with eau-de-feu, or firewater, which\\r\\nmade them like wild beasts. The most frightful disorders\\r\\nwere prevalent, the most heinous crimes committed, and\\r\\nscandalous demoralization followed. In 1660 the evil was\\r\\nso great that Mgr de Laval, exercising his pastoral\\r\\nfunctions, decreed excommunication against all those\\r\\npursuing the brandy traffic in defiance of ordinances.\\r\\nThis might have stopped the progress of the evil had not\\r\\nthe governor Avaugour opened the door to renewed disorder\\r\\ntwo years later by a most unfortunate policy. Thereupon\\r\\nLaval crossed the ocean to France, obtained the governor\\'s\\r\\nrecall, and succeeded, though with some difficulty, in\\r\\nmaintaining the former prohibition. In 1663 the Sovereign\\r\\nCouncil enacted an ordinance strictly forbidding the\\r\\nselling or giving of brandy to Indians directly or\\r\\nindirectly, for any reason or pretence whatsoever. The\\r\\npenalty for the offence was a fine of three hundred\\r\\nlivres, payable one-third to the informers, one-third to\\r\\nthe Hotel-Dieu, and one-third to the public treasury.\\r\\nAnd for a second offence the punishment was whipping or\\r\\nbanishment. In 1667, after the Sovereign Council had been\\r\\nfinally reorganized, the prohibition was renewed, on a\\r\\nmotion of attorney-general Bourdon, under the same\\r\\npenalties as before, and it devolved many times upon the\\r\\ncouncil to condemn transgressors of this ordinance to\\r\\nfines, imprisonment, or corporal punishment. Talon was\\r\\npresent and concurred in these condemnations. But gradually\\r\\nhis mind changed. He was becoming daily more impressed\\r\\nwith the material benefits of the brandy traffic and less\\r\\nconvinced of its moral danger. He was besides displeased\\r\\nwith the bishop\\'s excommunication. In his view it was an\\r\\nencroachment of the spiritual upon the civil power. Under\\r\\nthe influence of these feelings he came to consider\\r\\nprohibition of the liquor traffic as a mistake, damaging\\r\\nto the trade and progress of the colony and to French\\r\\ninfluence over the Indian tribes. These were the arguments\\r\\nput forward by the supporters of the traffic. According\\r\\nto them, to refuse brandy to the Indians was to let the\\r\\nEnglish monopolize the profitable fur trade, and therefore\\r\\nto check the development of New France. The fur trade\\r\\nprovided an abundance of beaver skins, which formed a\\r\\nmost convenient medium of exchange. The possession of\\r\\nthese gave an impetus to trade, and brought to Canada a\\r\\nnumber of merchants and others who were consumers of\\r\\nnatural products and money spenders. Moreover, in Canada\\r\\nfurs were the main article of exportation. Their abundance\\r\\nswelled the public revenue and increased the number of\\r\\nships employed in the Canadian trade. And last, to use\\r\\nan argument of a higher order, the brandy traffic, in\\r\\nfostering trade with the Indian tribes, kept them in the\\r\\nbonds of an alliance and strengthened the political\\r\\nsituation of France in North America.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00091\">The above fairly, we think, represents the substance of\\r\\nthe plea made by the supporters of the liquor traffic.\\r\\nSuch indeed were the arguments used by the traders,\\r\\nfinally accepted by Talon, developed in after years by\\r\\nFrontenac, approved by Colbert on many occasions; such\\r\\nwas the political and commercial wisdom of those who\\r\\nthought mainly of the material progress of New France.\\r\\nTo those arguments Laval, the clergy, and many enlightened\\r\\npersons interested in the public welfare had a double\\r\\nanswer. First, there was at stake a question of principle\\r\\nimportant enough to be the sole ground of a decision.\\r\\nWas it right, for the sake of a material benefit, to\\r\\noutrage natural and Christian morality? Was it morally\\r\\nlawful, for the purpose of loading with furs the Quebec\\r\\nstores and the Rochelle ships, to instil into the Indian\\r\\nveins the accursed poison which inflamed them to theft,\\r\\nrape, incest, murder, suicide\\xe2\\x80\\x94all the frightful frenzy\\r\\nof bestial passion. As it was practised, the liquor\\r\\ntraffic could have no other result. A powerful consensus\\r\\nof evidence established this truth above all discussion.\\r\\nFor the Indians brandy was then, as it is now, a murderous\\r\\npoison. It is for this reason that at the present day\\r\\nthe government of Canada prohibits absolutely the sale\\r\\nof intoxicating liquor in the territories where the\\r\\nwretched remnants of the aborigines are gathered. The\\r\\nstrictness of the modern laws is a striking vindication\\r\\nof Laval and those who stood by him.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00092\">Moreover the prohibition of the brandy traffic was not\\r\\nas detrimental to the material development of the colony\\r\\nas was contended. It was possible to trade with the\\r\\nOutaouais, the Algonquins, the Iroquois, without the\\r\\nallurement of brandy. The Indians themselves acknowledged\\r\\nthat strong liquor ruined them. The Abbe Dollier de\\r\\nCasson, superior of the Montreal Sulpicians, was perfectly\\r\\nright when he made the following statement:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00093\" style=\"margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%\">   We should have had all the Iroquois, if they had not\\r\\n   seen that there is as much disorder here as in their\\r\\n   country, and that we are even worse than the heretics.\\r\\n   The Indian drunkard does not resist the drinking craze\\r\\n   when brandy is at hand. But afterwards, when he sees\\r\\n   himself naked and disarmed, his nose gnawed, his body\\r\\n   maimed and bruised, he becomes mad with rage against\\r\\n   those who caused him to fall into such a state.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00094\">Some years later the governor Denonville answered those\\r\\nwho enlarged on the danger of throwing the Indians on\\r\\nthe friendship of the Dutch and English if they were\\r\\nrefused brandy. \\'Those who maintain,\\' he said, \\'that if\\r\\nwe refuse liquor to the Indians they will go to the\\r\\nEnglish, are not trustworthy, for the Indians are not\\r\\nanxious to drink when they do not see the liquor; and\\r\\nthe most sensible of them wish that brandy had never\\r\\nexisted, because they ruin themselves in giving away\\r\\ntheir furs and even their clothes for drink: Denonville\\'s\\r\\nopinion was the more justified in that at one time the\\r\\nNew England authorities proposed to the French a joint\\r\\nprohibition of the sale of brandy to Indians, and actually\\r\\npassed an ordinance to that effect.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00095\">There were many other articles besides brandy that were\\r\\nneeded by the Indians, and for which they were obliged\\r\\nto exchange their furs. But even had the prohibition\\r\\ncaused a decrease in the fur trade, would the evil have\\r\\nbeen so great? Fewer colonists would have been diverted\\r\\nfrom agriculture. As it was, the exodus from the settlements\\r\\nof bushrangers in search of furs was a source of weakness,\\r\\nand the flower of Canadian youth disappeared every year\\r\\nin the wilderness. Had this drain of national vitality\\r\\nbeen avoided, the settlement of Canada would have been\\r\\nmore rapid. Even from the material point of view it can\\r\\nbe maintained that the opponents of the brandy traffic\\r\\nunderstood better than its supporters the true interests\\r\\nof New France.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00096\">For a long while this important question divided and\\r\\nagitated the Canadian people. The religious authorities,\\r\\nknowing the evil and crimes that resulted from the sale\\r\\nof intoxicating liquor to the Indians, made strenuous\\r\\nefforts to secure the most severe restriction if not the\\r\\nprohibition of the deadly traffic. They spoke in the name\\r\\nof public morality and national honour, of humanity and\\r\\ndivine love. The civil authorities, more interested in\\r\\nthe financial and political advantages than in the question\\r\\nof principle, favoured toleration and even authorization\\r\\nof the trade. Hence the conflicts and misunderstandings\\r\\nwhich have enlivened, or rather saddened, the pages of\\r\\nCanadian history.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00097\">It is to be regretted that the intendant Talon sided with\\r\\nthe supporters of free traffic in brandy. We have said\\r\\nthat at first he wavered. The rulings of the Sovereign\\r\\nCouncil in 1667 seem to show it. But his earnest desire\\r\\nfor the prosperity of the colony\\xe2\\x80\\x94the development of her\\r\\ntrade, the increase of her population, the improvement\\r\\nof her finances\\xe2\\x80\\x94his ambition for the economic progress\\r\\nof New France, misled him and perverted his judgment.\\r\\nThis is the only excuse that can be offered for the\\r\\ngreatest error of his life. For he must be held responsible\\r\\nfor the ordinance passed by the Sovereign Council on\\r\\nNovember 10, 1668. This ordinance, after setting forth\\r\\nthat in order to protect the Indians against the curse\\r\\nof drunkenness it was better to have recourse to freedom\\r\\nthan to leave them a prey to the wily devices of\\r\\nunscrupulous men, enacted that thereafter, with the king\\'s\\r\\npermission, all the residents of New France might sell\\r\\nand deliver intoxicating liquor to the Indians willing\\r\\nto trade with them. The gate was opened. It was in vain\\r\\nthat the ordinance went on to forbid the Indians to get\\r\\ndrunk under a penalty of two beavers and exposure in the\\r\\npillory. A fearful punishment indeed!</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00098\">Talon\\'s good faith was undeniable. On this occasion he\\r\\ndoubtless thought that he was still serving the cause of\\r\\npublic welfare. But, without questioning his intentions,\\r\\nwe cannot but admit that his life\\'s record contains pages\\r\\nmore admirable than this one.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 id=\"id00099\" style=\"margin-top: 4em\">CHAPTER VI</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5 id=\"id00100\">TALON AND THE CLERGY</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00101\">In the instructions which Talon had received from Louis\\r\\nXIV on his departure from France in 1665 it was stated\\r\\nthat Mgr de Laval and the Jesuits exercised too strong\\r\\nan authority and that the superiority of the civil power\\r\\nshould be cautiously asserted. The intendant was quite\\r\\nready to follow these directions. He had been reared in\\r\\nthe principles of the old parliamentarian school and was\\r\\nthoroughly imbued with Gallican ideas. But at the same\\r\\ntime he was a sincere believer and faithful in the\\r\\nperformance of his religious duties. It is not surprising,\\r\\ntherefore, that he should be found ever earnest in his\\r\\nendeavours to promote the extension of Christianity and\\r\\nready to protect the missionaries, as well as the charitable\\r\\nand educational institutions, in their work. Neither is\\r\\nit surprising that he should sometimes seem jealous of\\r\\necclesiastical influence in matters where Church and\\r\\nState were both concerned.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00102\">The following incident will show to what lengths he was\\r\\nprepared to go when he thought that there was an\\r\\nencroachment of the spiritual on the civil power. The\\r\\nwinter of 1667 was very gay at Quebec. Peace had been\\r\\nsecured, confidence in the future of the colony was\\r\\nrestored, and there manifested itself a general disposition\\r\\nto indulge in social festivities. Indeed the first ball\\r\\never given in Canada took place in February of this year\\r\\nat M. Chartier de Lotbiniere\\'s house, as is recorded in\\r\\nthe Journal des Jesuites. Now there was at this time in\\r\\nQuebec a religious association for women called the\\r\\nAssociation of the Holy Family. Laval himself had framed\\r\\ntheir rules, one of which directed the members to abstain\\r\\nfrom frivolous entertainments and to lead a pious and\\r\\nedifying life amidst the distractions and dissipations\\r\\nof the world. Seeing that many members of the association\\r\\nhad departed from the rules by taking part in these\\r\\npleasures, Laval threatened to suspend their meetings.\\r\\nNaturally a strong impression was made on the public\\r\\nmind. Talon resented what he deemed an undue interference.\\r\\nHe laid a complaint against the bishop\\'s action before\\r\\nthe Sovereign Council and asked that two of their number\\r\\nbe directed to report on the social entertainments held\\r\\nduring the last carnival, in order to show that nothing\\r\\nimproper had taken place. When the report was made, it\\r\\ndeclared that nothing deserving of condemnation had\\r\\noccurred in these festivities, and that there was no\\r\\noccasion to censure them. Evidently, if there was\\r\\nencroachment upon this occasion, it was encroachment of\\r\\nthe civil on the spiritual power. The special rules of\\r\\na pious association in no way affected the safety of the\\r\\nstate or public order. If a number of ladies wished to\\r\\njoin its ranks and accept its discipline in order to\\r\\nfollow the path of Christian perfection and lead a more\\r\\nexemplary life in the world, they should be free to do\\r\\nso, and their directors should be free to remonstrate\\r\\nwith them if they were not faithful to their pledge. In\\r\\nthis incident the intendant was not at his best. He seems\\r\\nto have sought an occasion of checking the bishop\\'s\\r\\nauthority, and the occasion was not well chosen. It is\\r\\nlikely that M. de Tracy, still in the colony at the time,\\r\\nintervened in the interests of peace, for the entry in\\r\\nregard to Talon\\'s complaint was erased from the register\\r\\nof the Sovereign Council.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00103\">In a state paper by Talon for Colbert\\'s information, in\\r\\n1669, the intendant\\'s Gallican views reveal themselves\\r\\nfully. He complains of the excessive zeal of the bishop\\r\\nand clergy which led them to interfere in matters of\\r\\npolice, thus trespassing upon the province of the civil\\r\\nmagistrate. He went on to say that too strict a moral\\r\\ndiscipline of confessors and spiritual directors put a\\r\\nconstraint on consciences, and that, in order to\\r\\ncounterbalance the excessive claims to obedience of the\\r\\nclergy then in charge, other priests should be sent to\\r\\nCanada with full powers for administration of the\\r\\nsacraments. It is more than probable that in writing\\r\\nthese lines Talon was thinking of the vexed question of\\r\\nthe liquor traffic, always a source of strife between\\r\\nthe civil and the spiritual authorities.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00104\">Talon and his colleagues, Tracy and Courcelle, had to\\r\\ndeal with the question of tithes. In 1663 tithes had been\\r\\nfixed by royal edict at one-thirteenth of all that is\\r\\nproduced from the soil either naturally or by man\\'s\\r\\nlabour. This edict was prompted by the erection of the\\r\\nQuebec Seminary by Laval, and established in Canada the\\r\\ntithes system for the benefit of the new clerical\\r\\ninstitution, to which was entrusted the spiritual care\\r\\nof the colonists. The latter, who previously had paid\\r\\nnothing for the maintenance of the clergy, protested\\r\\nagainst the charge, notwithstanding that it was in\\r\\nconformity with the common practice of Christian nations.\\r\\nLaval, taking into consideration the poverty of the colony\\r\\nat the time, freely granted delays and exemptions, so\\r\\nthat in 1667 the question was still practically in\\r\\nabeyance. In that year the bishop presented to Tracy a\\r\\npetition for the publication of a decree in respect to\\r\\nthe tithes. The lieutenant-general, the governor, and\\r\\nthe intendant gave the matter their attention, and after\\r\\ndiscussion an ordinance was passed for payment of tithes,\\r\\nconsisting of the twenty-sixth part of all that the soil\\r\\ngrows, naturally or by man\\'s labour, for the benefit of\\r\\nthe priests who ministered to the spiritual wants of the\\r\\npeople. There was a proviso stating that the words \\'by\\r\\nman\\'s labour\\' did not include manufactures or fisheries,\\r\\nbut only the products of the soil when cultivated and\\r\\nfertilized by human industry. The assessment of\\r\\none-twenty-sixth was to be levied for a term of twenty\\r\\nyears only, after which the tithes were to be fixed\\r\\naccording to the needs of the time and the state of the\\r\\ncountry. Later on, in 1679, a royal edict made perpetual\\r\\nthe rate of one-twenty-sixth. For years the practice\\r\\nprevailed of levying tithes only on grain. But in 1705\\r\\ntwo parish priests maintained that they should be levied\\r\\nalso on hemp, flax, tobacco, pumpkins, hay\\xe2\\x80\\x94on all that\\r\\nis grown on cultivated land. A heated discussion in the\\r\\nSovereign Council took place, led by the attorney-general\\r\\nAuteuil. The two priests contended that the ordinance of\\r\\nTracy, Courcelle, and Talon did not limit the tithes to\\r\\ngrain; it stated that they should be levied on all that\\r\\nthe soil grows naturally or by man\\'s labour. Unfortunately\\r\\nthey had only a copy of the ordinance of 1667 to file in\\r\\nsupport of their contention. The attorney-general maintained\\r\\nthat the original ordinance of 1663 limited the tithes\\r\\nto grain, and that the constant practice was a confirmation\\r\\nand an evidence of the rule. But, strange to say, he\\r\\ncould not put the original ordinance on record. It had\\r\\nbeen lost. However, the practice was held to decide the\\r\\ncase, and the priests\\' contention was not sustained. From\\r\\nthat time the question was settled, definitely and for\\r\\never; the tithes were levied only on grain, as they are\\r\\nstill levied in the province of Quebec, on all lands\\r\\nowned by Catholics. But it is interesting to know as a\\r\\nmatter of history that the two litigant priests were\\r\\nright. Had the original ordinance been before the council,\\r\\nit would have been found to enact the levying of tithes\\r\\nnot on grain alone but on \\'all that the soil grows\\r\\nnaturally or by man\\'s labour.\\' An authentic copy of this\\r\\nordinance was discovered in our day, nearly two centuries\\r\\nafter the lawsuit of 1705, and it bears out the plea of\\r\\nthe two priests.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00105\">Another feature of Talon\\'s relations with the clergy and\\r\\nreligious communities\\xe2\\x80\\x94and a pleasant one this time\\xe2\\x80\\x94was\\r\\nhis strong interest in the francisation (Frenchification)\\r\\nof the Indians. It was Colbert\\'s wish that efforts be\\r\\nmade to bring the Algonquins, Hurons, and other Indians\\r\\nmore closely within the fold of European civilization\\xe2\\x80\\x94to\\r\\nmake them alter their manners, learn the French tongue,\\r\\nand become less Indian and more European in their way of\\r\\nlife. Talon was of the same mind and lost no opportunity\\r\\nof impressing the idea on those who could best do the\\r\\nwork. Laval had already been active in the same direction,\\r\\nand had founded the Quebec Seminary partly with this end\\r\\nin view. The great bishop thought that one of the best\\r\\nmeans of civilizing the Indians would be to bring up\\r\\nIndian and French children together. So he withdrew from\\r\\nthe Jesuits\\' College a number of pupils whom he had\\r\\npreviously placed there and established them, with a few\\r\\nyoung Indians, in a house bought for the purpose. Such\\r\\nwere the beginnings of the Quebec Seminary, opened on\\r\\nOctober 9, 1663. The first class consisted of eight French\\r\\nand six Indian children. The seminary trained them in\\r\\nthe practice of piety and morality. For ordinary instruction\\r\\nthey went to the Jesuits. The Jesuits\\' College had been\\r\\nfounded in 1635 and was of great service to the colony.\\r\\nIt was pronounced by Laval in 1661 almost equal in\\r\\neducational advantages and standing to the Jesuits\\'\\r\\nestablishments in France; and according to a trustworthy\\r\\nauthor it \\'was a reproduction on a small scale of the\\r\\nFrench colleges: classes in letters and arts, literary\\r\\nand theatrical entertainments, were found there.\\' Some\\r\\nof the public performances given at the Jesuits\\' College\\r\\nwere memorable, such as the reception to the Vicomte\\r\\nd\\'Argenson when he entered upon the government of New\\r\\nFrance, and the philosophical debate of July 2, 1666,\\r\\nwhich was graced with the presence of Tracy, Courcelle,\\r\\nand Talon. Two promising youths, Louis Jolliet and Pierre\\r\\nde Francheville, won universal praise on that occasion;\\r\\nand Talon himself, who had been accustomed in France to\\r\\nsuch scholastic exercises, took part in it very pertinently,\\r\\nto the great delight of all present.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00106\">To return to the francisation of Indians: the Ursulines\\r\\nwere also enlisted in the cause. Since their arrival in\\r\\nCanada in 1639 it had been for them a labour of love. In\\r\\nthe convent and school founded by Mother Marie de\\r\\nl\\'Incarnation and Madame de la Peltrie, both French and\\r\\nIndian girls received instruction in various subjects.\\r\\nSeven nuns attended daily to the classes. The Indian\\r\\ngirls had special classes and teachers, but they were\\r\\nlodged and boarded along with the French children. Some\\r\\nof these Indian pupils of the Ursulines afterwards married\\r\\nFrenchmen and became excellent wives and mothers. Special\\r\\nmention. is made of one of the girls as being able to\\r\\nread and write both French and Huron remarkably well.\\r\\nFrom her speech it was hard to believe that she was born\\r\\nan Indian. Talon was so delighted with this instance of\\r\\nsuccessful francisation that he asked her to write\\r\\nsomething in Huron and French that he might send it to\\r\\nFrance. This, however, was but an exceptional case. Mother\\r\\nMary declared in one of her letters that it was very\\r\\ndifficult, if not impossible, to civilize the Indian\\r\\ngirls.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00107\">During this period the Ursulines had on an average from\\r\\ntwenty to thirty resident pupils. The French girls were\\r\\nsupposed to pay one hundred and twenty livres. Indian\\r\\ngirls paid nothing. The Ursuline sisters and Mother Mary,\\r\\ntheir head, did a noble work for Canada; the same must\\r\\nbe said of the venerable Mother Marguerite Bourgeoys and\\r\\nthe ladies of the Congregation of Notre-Dame founded in\\r\\n1659 at Montreal. At first this school was open to both\\r\\nboys and girls. But in 1668 M. Souart, a Sulpician, took\\r\\nthe boys under his care, and thenceforth the education\\r\\nof the male portion of the youth of Ville-Marie was in\\r\\nthe hands of the priests of Saint-Sulpice. At this time\\r\\nthe Sulpicians of Montreal were receiving welcome accessions\\r\\nto their number; the Abbes Trouve and de Fenelon arrived\\r\\nin 1667, and the Abbes Queylus, d\\'Allet, de Galinee, and\\r\\nd\\'Urfe in 1668. In the latter year Fenelon and Trouve\\r\\nwere authorized by Laval to establish a new missionary\\r\\nstation. for a tribe of Cayugas as far west as the bay\\r\\nof Quinte on the north shore of Lake Ontario. The progress\\r\\nof mission work was now most encouraging. Peace prevailed\\r\\nand the Iroquois country was open to the heralds of the\\r\\nGospel. Fathers Fremin and Pierron were living among the\\r\\nMohawks; Father Bruyas with the Oneidas. In 1668 Father\\r\\nFremin was sent to the Senecas, Father Milet to the\\r\\nOnondagas, and Father de Carheil to the Cayugas. The\\r\\nbloody Iroquois, who had tortured and slain so many\\r\\nmissionaries, were now asking for preachers of the\\r\\nChristian faith, and receiving them with due honour. It\\r\\nis true that the hard task of conversion remained, and\\r\\nthat Indian vices and superstitions were not easily\\r\\novercome. But at least the savages were ready to listen\\r\\nto Christian teaching. Some of them had courage enough\\r\\nto reform their lives. Children and women were baptized.\\r\\nMany received when dying the sacraments of the Church.\\r\\nMoreover, the sublime courage and self-devotion of the\\r\\nmissionaries inspired the Indian mind with a profound\\r\\nrespect for Christianity and added very greatly to the\\r\\ninfluence and prestige of the French name among the\\r\\ntribes.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00108\">On the whole the situation in Canada at the end of 1668,\\r\\nthree years after Talon\\'s arrival, was most satisfactory.\\r\\nPeace and security were restored; hope had replaced\\r\\ndespondency; colonization, agriculture, and trade were\\r\\nmaking progress; population was increasing yearly. In\\r\\nthis short space of time New France had been saved from\\r\\ndestruction and was now full of new vigour. Every one in\\r\\nthe colony knew that the great intendant had been the\\r\\nsoul of the revival, the leader in all this progress. It\\r\\nmay therefore be easily imagined what was the state of\\r\\npopular feeling when the news came that Talon was to\\r\\nleave Canada. He had twice asked for his recall. The\\r\\nclimate was severe, his health was not good, and family\\r\\nmatters called for his presence in France; moreover, he\\r\\nwas worried by his difficulties with the governor and\\r\\nthe spiritual authorities. Louis XIV gave him leave to\\r\\nreturn to France and appointed Claude de Bouteroue in\\r\\nhis stead.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00109\">Talon left Quebec in November 1668. Expressions of deep\\r\\nregret were heard on all sides. Mother Marie de\\r\\nl\\'Incarnation wrote: \\'M. Talon is leaving us and goes\\r\\nback to France. It is a great loss to Canada and a great\\r\\nsorrow for all. For, during his term here as intendant,\\r\\nthis country has developed more and progressed more than\\r\\nit had done before from the time of the first settlement\\r\\nby the French.\\' The annalist of the Hotel-Dieu was not\\r\\nless sympathetic, but there was hope in her utterance:\\r\\n\\'M. Talon,\\' she said, \\'left for France this year. He\\r\\ncomforted us in our grief by leading us to expect his\\r\\nreturn.\\' Perhaps these last words show that Talon even\\r\\nthen intended to come back to Canada if such should be\\r\\nthe wish of the king and his minister.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 id=\"id00110\" style=\"margin-top: 4em\">CHAPTER VII</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5 id=\"id00111\">TALON\\'S EVENTFUL JOURNEY</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00112\">Talon returned to France in an auspicious hour. It was\\r\\nperhaps the happiest and brightest period of the reign\\r\\nof Louis XIV. France had emerged victorious from two\\r\\ncampaigns, and the king had just signed a treaty which\\r\\nadded to his realm a part of the province of Flanders.\\r\\nThe kingdom enjoyed peace, and its prosperity had never\\r\\nbeen so great. Thanks to Colbert, the exchequer was full.\\r\\nIn all departments the French government was displaying\\r\\nintelligent activity. Trade and commerce, agriculture\\r\\nand manufacture, were encouraged and protected. With\\r\\nample means at their disposal and perfect freedom of\\r\\naction, Louis XIV and Colbert could not but be in a\\r\\nfavourable mood to receive Talon\\'s reports and proposals.\\r\\nTalon acted as if he were still the intendant of New\\r\\nFrance; and though for the time being he was not, he was\\r\\nsurely the most powerful agent or advocate that the colony\\r\\ncould have. The king and his minister readily acquiesced\\r\\nin his schemes for strengthening the Canadian colony. It\\r\\nwas decided to dispatch six companies of soldiers to\\r\\nreinforce the four already there, and ultimately, upon\\r\\nbeing disbanded, to aid in settling the country. Many\\r\\nhundred labourers and unmarried women and a new stock of\\r\\ndomestic animals were also to be sent. Colbert had never\\r\\nbeen so much in earnest concerning New France. He attended\\r\\npersonally to details, gave orders for the levy of troops\\r\\nand for the shipping of the men and supplies, and urged\\r\\non the officials in charge so that everything should be\\r\\nready early in the spring. To M. de Courcelle he wrote\\r\\nthese welcome tidings:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00113\" style=\"margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%\">   His Majesty has appropriated over 200,000 livres to\\r\\n   do what he deems necessary for the colony. One hundred\\r\\n   and fifty girls are going thither to be married; six\\r\\n   companies complete with fifty good men in each and\\r\\n   thirty officers or noblemen, who wish to settle there,\\r\\n   and more than two hundred other persons are also going.\\r\\n   Such an effort shows how greatly interested in Canada\\r\\n   His Majesty feels, and to what extent he will appreciate\\r\\n   all that may be done to help its progress.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00114\">That the minister was not actuated merely by a passing\\r\\nmood, but by a set purpose, may be seen from a passage\\r\\nof a letter to Terron, the intendant at Rochefort: \\'I am\\r\\nvery glad,\\' Colbert wrote, \\'that you have not gone beyond\\r\\nthe funds appropriated for the passage of the men and\\r\\ngirls to Canada. You know how important it is to keep\\r\\nwithin the limits, especially in an outlay which will\\r\\nhave to be repeated every year.\\'</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00115\">In the meantime Talon was pleading the cause of Canada\\r\\nin another direction. Always intent on freeing New France\\r\\nfrom the commercial monopoly of the West India Company,\\r\\nhe renewed his assault against that corporation, and at\\r\\nlast he was successful. This signal victory showed plainly\\r\\nhis great influence with the minister. Colbert conveyed\\r\\nthe gratifying information to Courcelle:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00116\" style=\"margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%\">   His Majesty has granted freedom of trade to Canada,\\r\\n   so that the colony may hereafter receive more easily\\r\\n   the provisions and supplies needed. It will now be\\r\\n   necessary to inform the colonists that they must\\r\\n   provide cargoes agreeable to the French, who will\\r\\n   supply them with necessities, and so make a profitable\\r\\n   exchange of goods. For there is now a great supply\\r\\n   of furs in this kingdom, and if there were no other\\r\\n   goods available as a return cargo perhaps the French\\r\\n   ships would not go there.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00117\">The spring of 1669 was memorable for Canada. Nearly all\\r\\nthat Talon asked for New France was granted. But one\\r\\nthing which he did not ask was desired by Louis and\\r\\nColbert. It is probable that Talon intended to go back\\r\\nto Canada, but he did not expect or wish to return\\r\\nimmediately. Yet this was what the king and the minister\\r\\ndeemed advisable and even essential. It was very well to\\r\\nsend troops, labourers, women, settlers, and supplies;\\r\\nbut, in order that all should yield their maximum of\\r\\nefficiency, it was necessary that the business affairs\\r\\nof the colony should again be placed in the hands of the\\r\\nintendant, who had already worked wonders by his sagacity\\r\\nand skilful management. There was no man who knew so well\\r\\nthe weak and strong points, the requirements and\\r\\npossibilities of Canada. True, only a few months had\\r\\nelapsed since the king had given him permission to leave\\r\\nCanada, and had appointed in his stead another intendant\\r\\nwho, naturally enough, would expect to be in charge for\\r\\nat least two years. But, on the other hand, the king\\'s\\r\\nservice and the public good demanded his reappointment.\\r\\nTalon had to acquiesce. He had reached Paris at the end\\r\\nof December. Three months later he was again intendant\\r\\nof New France, and on April Louis XIV wrote to the\\r\\nintendant Bouteroue at Quebec informing him of Talon\\'s\\r\\nreinstatement. To leave France so soon must have been\\r\\nfor Talon a great sacrifice, but it was a high compliment\\r\\nthat Louis and Colbert were paying to his talents and\\r\\nadministrative abilities. On May 10, 1669, the king signed\\r\\nhis new commission, and on the 17th he received his\\r\\ninstructions, a document much shorter than the one framed\\r\\nfor his direction in 1665. No minute advice was needed\\r\\nthis time, for Talon was himself the best authority on\\r\\nall matters relating to Canada.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00118\">Talon sailed from La Rochelle on July 15. He was accompanied\\r\\nby Captain Francois Marie Perrot, one of the six commanders\\r\\nof the companies sent to Canada; by Fathers Romuald\\r\\nPapillion, Hilarion Guesnin, Cesaire Herveau, and Brother\\r\\nCosme Graveran. Perrot was married to the niece of the\\r\\nintendant. The friars belonged to the Franciscan order\\r\\nand to the particular branch of it known under the name\\r\\nof Recollets. It had been thought good to reintroduce\\r\\ninto Canada the religious society whose priests had been\\r\\nthe first to preach the Gospel there. The intendant\\'s\\r\\nformer voyage from France to Canada had lasted one hundred\\r\\nand seventeen days, so that, allowing for all probable\\r\\ndelays, he might expect to reach Quebec by the end of\\r\\nOctober at the latest. But it was decreed that he was\\r\\nnot to see New France this year. His ship was assailed\\r\\nby a series of storms and hurricanes and driven far from\\r\\nher right course. After three months of exertion and\\r\\nsuffering the captain was obliged to make for the port\\r\\nof Lisbon. There the ship was revictualled; but, having\\r\\nsailed again, she struck upon a rocky shoal at a distance\\r\\nof three leagues from Lisbon and was totally wrecked.\\r\\nTalon and his companions were fortunately saved, and\\r\\nfound themselves back in France at the beginning of the\\r\\nyear 1670.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00119\">In the meantime what was going on in Canada? Talon\\'s\\r\\nsuccessor, M. de Bouteroue, was upright and intelligent,\\r\\nbut without Talon\\'s masterly gifts and activity. He\\r\\nattended principally to the administration of justice.\\r\\nAt the judicial sittings of the Sovereign Council he was\\r\\nalmost always present; he himself heard many cases, and\\r\\noften acted as judge-advocate. On his advice the council\\r\\ngave out an ordinance fixing the price of wheat. There\\r\\nhad been complaints that sometimes creditors refused to\\r\\naccept wheat in payment, or accepted it only at a price\\r\\nunreasonably low. So it was enacted that for three months\\r\\nafter the promulgation of the decree debtors should be\\r\\nat liberty to pay their creditors in wheat of good quality\\r\\nat the price of four livres per bushel.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00120\">The evil consequences of the previous action of the\\r\\ncouncil in freeing the brandy traffic were already\\r\\nmanifest. The scourge of the coureurs de bois, later to\\r\\nprove so damaging to the colony, was beginning to be\\r\\nfelt. A new ordinance now prohibited the practice of\\r\\ngoing into the woods with liquor to meet the Indians and\\r\\ntrade with them. This ordinance also enjoined sobriety\\r\\nupon the Indians and held them responsible for the\\r\\ndrunkenness of their squaws, while the French were\\r\\nforbidden to drink with them. Hunting in the forest was\\r\\nonly allowed by leave of the commandant of the district\\r\\nor the nearest judge, to whose inspection all luggage\\r\\nand goods for trade must be submitted. Brandy might be\\r\\ntaken on these expeditions, but no more than one pot per\\r\\nman for eight days. The penalty for violating any of\\r\\nthese provisions of the law was confiscation, with a fine\\r\\nof fifty livres for a first offence and corporal punishment\\r\\nfor a second. Thus, but in vain, did the leaders of New\\r\\nFrance attempt to stay the progress of Indian debauchery.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00121\">During the summer of 1669 a renewal of the war between\\r\\nthe French and the Iroquois was threatened. Three French\\r\\nsoldiers had killed six Oneidas, after making them drunk\\r\\nfor the purpose of stealing their furs; three other\\r\\nsoldiers had treacherously murdered a Seneca chief for\\r\\nthe same purpose. The Outaouais also, who were in alliance\\r\\nwith the French, attacked a party of Iroquois, killing\\r\\nand capturing many. Incensed at these acts of hostility,\\r\\nthe Iroquois threatened to unbury the tomahawk. Courcelle\\r\\nat once set himself to the task of averting the danger.\\r\\nHe went to Montreal, where many hundred Indians had\\r\\ngathered for the annual fair, to which they always came\\r\\nin great numbers for the purpose of exchanging their furs\\r\\nfor goods. He convened a large meeting and made an address\\r\\nof great vigour and cleverness, his speech being accompanied\\r\\nby appropriate gifts. He then proceeded to carry out the\\r\\nsentence of the law upon the murderers of the Seneca\\r\\nchief, who were shot on the spot in the presence of the\\r\\nassembly. The Iroquois were placated; three men killed\\r\\nfor the death of one convinced them that French justice\\r\\nwas neither slow nor faltering. In the meantime the\\r\\nOutaouais had brought back three of their prisoners and\\r\\npledged themselves for the surrender of twelve others.\\r\\nin this way war was averted and peace maintained.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00122\">The first ships coming from France that summer brought\\r\\nletters from Colbert to Courcelle and Bouteroue intimating\\r\\nthat Talon was returning to resume his charge. Bouteroue\\r\\nwas probably surprised to learn that he was to be superseded\\r\\nso soon, and the governor may have been disappointed to\\r\\nhear of the early arrival of a man whose authority and\\r\\nprestige made him somewhat uneasy. But in the colony the\\r\\nrejoicing was general. Mother Marie de l\\'Incarnation\\r\\nwrote: \\'We expect daily M. Talon whom the king sends back\\r\\nto settle everything according to His Majesty\\'s views.\\r\\nHe brings with him five hundred men. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6If God favours\\r\\nhis journey and brings him happily to port he will find\\r\\nnew means of increasing the country\\'s wealth.\\' Several\\r\\nweeks elapsed, and Talon\\'s ship did not appear. Some\\r\\nanxiety was felt. Mother Marie wrote again: \\'M. Talon\\r\\nhas not arrived; in his ship alone there were five hundred\\r\\nmen. We are greatly concerned at the delay. They may have\\r\\nlanded again in France, or have been lost in the storms\\r\\nwhich have proved to be so dreadful.\\' The autumn of 1669\\r\\nhad been a stormy season. Fearful hurricanes swept over\\r\\nQuebec. The lower town was flooded to an incredible\\r\\nheight, many buildings were destroyed, and the havoc\\r\\namounted to 100,000 livres. All this was painfully\\r\\ndisquieting. To quote Mother Marie again: \\'If M. Talon\\r\\nhas been wrecked, it will be an irretrievable loss to\\r\\nthe colony, for, the king having given him a free hand,\\r\\nhe could undertake great things without minding the\\r\\noutlay.\\' In the meantime M. Patoulet, Talon\\'s secretary,\\r\\nwho had left France on another ship and had reached Quebec\\r\\nsafely, wrote to Colbert: \\'If he is dead, His Majesty\\r\\nwill have lost a good subject, yourself, Monseigneur, a\\r\\nfaithful servant, Canada an affectionate father, and\\r\\nmyself a good master.\\'</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00123\">Fortunately, as we have already seen, Talon was not lost.\\r\\nAt the very time when these letters were written he was\\r\\non his way back to France, where he spent the winter hard\\r\\nat work with Colbert\\xe2\\x80\\x94preparing for the dispatch of\\r\\nsettlers and soldiers in the spring. The minister displayed\\r\\nthe same zeal as the year before. He appropriated ample\\r\\nfunds, gave urgent orders, and seemed to make the Canadian\\r\\nreinforcements his personal affair. Talon sailed from La\\r\\nRochelle about the middle of May 1670. He was accompanied\\r\\nby Perrot again, and also by six Recollets, four fathers\\r\\nand two brothers. After three months at sea he was nearly\\r\\nshipwrecked once more, this time near Tadoussac, almost\\r\\nat the end of his journey. On August 18, after an absence\\r\\nfrom Canada of one year and nine months, he landed once\\r\\nmore at Quebec.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 id=\"id00124\" style=\"margin-top: 4em\">CHAPTER VIII</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5 id=\"id00125\">RENEWED EFFORTS AND PROGRESS</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00126\">When Talon arrived at Quebec, New France had again just\\r\\nescaped an Indian war. A party of Iroquois hunting near\\r\\nthe country of the Outaouais met two men of their nation\\r\\nwho had been prisoners of the Outaouais and had succeeded\\r\\nin escaping. These informed their fellow-tribesmen that\\r\\nthe Outaouais village was undefended, almost every warrior\\r\\nbeing absent. The Iroquois then attacked the village,\\r\\ndestroyed it, and brought with them as prisoners about\\r\\none hundred women and children. The Outaouais warriors,\\r\\nwhen apprised of the raid, started in pursuit, but did\\r\\nnot succeed in overtaking the raiders. However, receiving\\r\\na reinforcement of another party of allied Indians, they\\r\\ninvaded the Senecas\\' territory. These hostilities aroused\\r\\nthe temper of the Iroquois, and a general Indian war\\r\\nthreatened, into which the French would unavoidably be\\r\\ndrawn. At that moment Garakonthie, the Iroquois chief\\r\\nwho had always been friendly to the French, advised the\\r\\nFive Nations to send an embassy to the governor of Canada\\r\\nasking him to compose these differences. The Five Nations\\r\\nagreed, and Iroquois and Outaouais delegates, many hundreds\\r\\nin number, came to Quebec. A great council was held\\r\\nlasting three days, and Courcelle succeeded in bringing\\r\\nabout an understanding between the rival tribes. After\\r\\nthe meetings Garakonthie asked to be baptized, and Laval\\r\\nhimself performed the ceremony.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00127\">It was but a few days after these events that Talon\\r\\narrived, and, notwithstanding the improvement in the\\r\\nsituation, he does not seem to have deemed peace perfectly\\r\\nsecure, for he wrote to the king that it would be advisable\\r\\nto send two hundred more soldiers. He added that the\\r\\nIroquois caused great injury to the trade of the colony\\r\\nby hunting the beaver in the territories of the tribes\\r\\nallied with the French, and selling the skins to Dutch\\r\\nand English traders. In another letter Talon set forth\\r\\nthat these traders drew from the Iroquois 1,000,000\\r\\nlivres\\' worth of the best beaver, and he suggested the\\r\\nconstruction of a small ship of the galley type to cruise\\r\\non Lake Ontario, and that two posts manned by one hundred\\r\\npicked soldiers should be established, one on the north,\\r\\nthe other on the south shore of that lake. These measures\\r\\nwould ensure safe communication between the colony and\\r\\nthe Outaouais country, keep the Iroquois aloof, and favour\\r\\nthe opening of new roads to the south. It was a broad\\r\\nand bold scheme. But could it be executed over the head\\r\\nof M. de Courcelle? Talon had foreseen this objection\\r\\nand had begged that the governor should be instructed to\\r\\ngive support and assistance. But once more the intendant\\r\\nwas going beyond his authority. Such an undertaking was\\r\\nclearly within the governor\\'s province. Talon was told\\r\\nthat he should lay his scheme before M. de Courcelle, so\\r\\nthat the governor might attend to its execution.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00128\">This incident sheds light upon the relations that existed\\r\\nbetween Courcelle and Talon. The former was valiant,\\r\\nenergetic, and intelligent; but he felt that he was\\r\\noutshone by the latter\\'s promptness, celerity in design,\\r\\nsuperior activity, wider and keener penetration, and he\\r\\ncould not conceal his displeasure.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00129\">After the great councils held at Quebec, the Senecas\\r\\nagain assumed a somewhat disquieting attitude. The\\r\\ngovernor, they said, had been too hard on them. He had\\r\\nthreatened to chastise them in their own country if they\\r\\ndid not bring back their prisoners. Perhaps his arm was\\r\\nnot long enough to strike so far. Evidently they had\\r\\nforgotten the expedition against the Mohawks five years\\r\\nago. They were convinced that distance and natural\\r\\nimpediments, such as rapids and torrents, protected them\\r\\nfrom invasion in their remote country south of Lake\\r\\nOntario. Courcelle resolved to shake their confidence.\\r\\nEarly in the spring he went to Montreal and ordered the\\r\\nconstruction of a flat-boat. In this he set out from\\r\\nLachine (June 3, 1671) with Perrot, governor of Montreal,\\r\\nCaptain de Laubia, Varennes, Le Moyne, La Valliere,\\r\\nNormanville, Abbe Dollier de Casson, and about fifty good\\r\\nmen. Thirteen canoes accompanied the flat-boat. After\\r\\nconsiderable exertion, the governor and his party passed\\r\\nthe rapids and continued up the St Lawrence; nine days\\r\\nlater they entered Lake Ontario, to the amazement of a\\r\\nparty of Iroquois whom they met there. The governor gave\\r\\nthese Indians a message for the Senecas and the other\\r\\nnations, stating that he wished to keep the peace, but\\r\\nthat, if necessary, he could come and devastate their\\r\\ncountry. The demonstration had the desired effect and\\r\\nthere was no further talk of war.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00130\">It will be inferred from Talon\\'s proposals and schemes\\r\\nalready mentioned that his thoughts were now occupied\\r\\nwith the external affairs of the colony. This indeed was\\r\\nto be the characteristic feature of his second\\r\\nadministration. When in Canada before he had concentrated\\r\\nhis attention chiefly upon judicial and political\\r\\norganization, and had directed his efforts to promote\\r\\ncolonization, agriculture, industry, and trade\\xe2\\x80\\x94in a\\r\\nword, the internal economy of New France. But now, without\\r\\nneglecting any part of his duty, he seemed desirous of\\r\\nwidening his sphere of action by the extension of French\\r\\ninfluence to the north, south, and west. On October 10,\\r\\n1670, he wrote to the king: \\'Since my arrival, I have\\r\\nsent resolute men to explore farther than has ever been\\r\\ndone in Canada, some to the west and north-west, others\\r\\nto the south-west and south. They will all on their return\\r\\nwrite accounts of their expeditions and frame their\\r\\nreports according to the instructions I have given them.\\r\\nEverywhere they will take possession of the country,\\r\\nerect posts bearing the king\\'s arms, and draw up memoranda\\r\\nof these proceedings to serve as title-deeds.\\'</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00131\">Of these explorers one of the most noted was Cavelier de\\r\\nla Salle. He had been born in 1643. After pursuing his\\r\\nstudies in a Jesuit college he came to Canada in 1666\\r\\nand obtained from the Sulpicians a grant of land near\\r\\nMontreal, named by him Saint-Sulpice, but ultimately\\r\\nknown under the name of Lachine. In 1669 Courcelle gave\\r\\nhim letters patent for an exploring journey towards the\\r\\nOhio and the Meschacebe, or Mississippi. By way of these\\r\\nrivers he hoped to reach the Vermilion Sea, or Gulf of\\r\\nCalifornia, and thus open a new road to China via the\\r\\nPacific ocean. At the same time the Abbes Dollier and de\\r\\nGalinee, Sulpicians, had prepared for a remote mission\\r\\nto the Outaouais. It was thought advisable to combine\\r\\nthe two expeditions. Thus it happened that La Salle and\\r\\nthe Sulpicians left Montreal in 1669 and journeyed together\\r\\nas far as the western end of Lake Ontario. There they\\r\\nparted. The Sulpicians wintered on the shores of Lake\\r\\nErie, and next spring passed the strait between Lakes\\r\\nErie and Huron, reached the Sault Sainte-Marie, and then\\r\\nreturned to Montreal by French river, Lake Nipissing,\\r\\nand the Ottawa river. Their journey lasted from July 4,\\r\\n1669, to June 18, 1670. In the meantime La Salle had\\r\\nreached the Ohio and had followed it to the falls at\\r\\nLouisville. He also returned in the summer of 1670. The\\r\\nitinerary of his next expedition, undertaken in the same\\r\\nyear, is not very well known. According to an account of\\r\\ndoubtful authority, he went through Lakes Erie and Huron,\\r\\nentered Lake Michigan, reached the Illinois river, and\\r\\neven the Mississippi. But a careful study of contemporaneous\\r\\ndocuments and evidence leads to the conclusion that the\\r\\nMississippi must be omitted from this itinerary. In our\\r\\nopinion La Salle did not reach that river in 1671, as\\r\\nhas been asserted; he probably went as far as the Illinois\\r\\ncountry.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00132\">Another of Talon\\'s resolute explorers was Simon Francois\\r\\nDaumont de Saint-Lusson. Accompanied by Nicolas Perrot,\\r\\nthe well-known interpreter, he left Quebec in September\\r\\n1670, and wintered with an Outaouais tribe near Lake\\r\\nSuperior. Perrot sent word to the neighbouring nations\\r\\nthat they should meet next spring at Sault Sainte-Marie\\r\\na delegate of the great French Ononthio. [Footnote: This\\r\\nwas the name given by the Indians to the king of France;\\r\\nthe governor was called by them Ononthio, which means\\r\\n\\'great mountain,\\' because that was the translation of\\r\\nMontmagny\\xe2\\x80\\x94mons magnus in Latin\\xe2\\x80\\x94the name of Champlain\\'s\\r\\nfirst successor. From M. de Montmagny the name had passed\\r\\nto the other governors, and the king had become the \\'great\\r\\nOnonthio.\\'] On June 14 representatives of fourteen nations\\r\\nwere gathered at the Sault. The Jesuit fathers Dablon,\\r\\nDreuillettes, Allouez, and Andre were present. A great\\r\\ncouncil was held on a height. Saint-Lusson had a cross\\r\\nerected with a post bearing the king\\'s arms. The Vexilla\\r\\nRegis and the Exaudiat were sung. The intendant\\'s delegates\\r\\ntook possession of the country in the name of their\\r\\nmonarch. There was firing of guns and shouts of \\'Vive le\\r\\nroi!\\' Then Father Allouez and Saint-Lusson made speeches\\r\\nsuitable to the occasion and the audience. At night the\\r\\nblaze of an immense bonfire illuminated with its fitful\\r\\nlight the dark trees and foaming rapids. The singing of\\r\\nthe Te Deum crowned that memorable day.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00133\">The intendant was pleased with the result of Saint-Lusson\\'s\\r\\nexpedition. He wrote to the king: \\'There is every reason\\r\\nto believe that from the point reached by this explorer\\r\\nto the Vermilion Sea is a distance of not more than three\\r\\nhundred leagues. The Western Sea [the Pacific ocean] does\\r\\nnot seem more distant. According to calculation based on\\r\\nthe Indians\\' reports and on the charts, there should not\\r\\nbe more than fifteen hundred leagues of navigation to\\r\\nreach Tartary, China, and Japan.\\'</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00134\">Talon showed his high appreciation of Saint-Lusson\\'s\\r\\nservices by immediately giving him another mission\\xe2\\x80\\x94this\\r\\ntime to Acadia, for the purpose of finding and reporting\\r\\nas to the best road to that colony. In 1670 Grandfontaine\\r\\nhad taken possession of Acadia, which had been restored\\r\\nto France by the treaty of Breda. He had received from\\r\\nSir Richard Walker the keys of Fort Pentagouet, at the\\r\\nmouth of the Penobscot river, and had sent Joybert de\\r\\nSoulanges to hoist the French flag over Jemsek and Port\\r\\nRoyal. It was therefore incumbent on the intendant to\\r\\nsee to the opening of a road between Quebec and Pentagouet.\\r\\nHis letters and those of Colbert written in 1671 are full\\r\\nof this project. A fund of thirty thousand livres was\\r\\nappropriated for the purpose. The intendant\\'s plan was\\r\\nto erect about twenty houses well provided with stores\\r\\nalong the proposed route at intervals of sixty leagues.\\r\\nHe also had in mind the establishment of settlements\\r\\nalong the rivers Penobscot and Kennebec, to form a barrier\\r\\nbetween New France and New England. With the object of\\r\\nestablishing trade relations between Canada and Acadia,\\r\\nhe sent to the French Bay (Bay of Fundy) a barge loaded\\r\\nwith clothes and supplies, and was extremely pleased to\\r\\nreceive in return a cargo of six thousand pounds of salt\\r\\nmeat. In 1671, for Colbert\\'s information, he drew up a\\r\\ncensus of Acadia. [Footnote: The figures were\\xe2\\x80\\x94Port\\r\\nRoyal, 359; Poboncoup, 11; Cap Negre, 3; Pentagouet, 6\\r\\nand 25 soldiers; Mouskadabouet, 13; Saint-Pierre, 7.\\r\\nTotal 399, or, including the soldiers, 424. There were\\r\\n429 cultivated acres, 866 head of cattle, 407 sheep and\\r\\n36 goats.] But, as we shall see, the great intendant was\\r\\nnot to remain in Canada long enough to bring his Acadian\\r\\nundertaking to full fruition.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00135\">Let us follow him in another direction. He had tried to\\r\\nextend the sphere of French influence towards the west\\r\\nand south, and was doing his best to strengthen Canada\\r\\non the New England border by promoting the development\\r\\nof Acadia. His next attempt was to bring the northern\\r\\ntribes into the French alliance and to open to the colony\\r\\nthe trade of the wide area extending from Lake St John\\r\\nto Lake Mistassini and thence to Hudson Bay. For an\\r\\nexpedition to Hudson Bay he chose Father Albanel, a\\r\\nJesuit, and M. de Saint-Simon. They left Quebec for\\r\\nTadoussac in August 1671, and ascended the Saguenay to\\r\\nLake St John where they wintered. In June 1672 they\\r\\ncontinued their journey, reaching Lake Mistassini on the\\r\\n18th of the same month and James Bay on the 28th. After\\r\\nformally taking possession of the country in the name of\\r\\nFrance, they returned by the same route to Quebec, where\\r\\non July 23 they laid their report before the intendant.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00136\">One of the last but not the least of the explorations\\r\\nmade under Talon\\'s auspices was that which he entrusted\\r\\nto Louis Jolliet, and which resulted in the discovery of\\r\\nthe upper Mississippi. Jolliet left Montreal in the autumn\\r\\nof 1672 and wintered at Michilimackinac, where he joined\\r\\nFather Marquette. Next spring they set out together, and\\r\\nby way of Lake Michigan, Green Bay, Fox river, and the\\r\\nWisconsin they reached the giant river, the mighty\\r\\nMississippi, which they followed down as far as latitude\\r\\n33 degrees. Thus was discovered the highway through the\\r\\ninterior of the continent to the Gulf of Mexico. One\\r\\nresult of the discovery was the birth of Louisiana a few\\r\\nyears later.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00137\">Talon\\'s patriotic enthusiasm was justified when he wrote\\r\\nto Louis XIV: \\'I am no courtier and it is not to please\\r\\nthe king or without reason that I say this portion of\\r\\nthe French monarchy is going to become something great.\\r\\nWhat I see now enables me to make such a prediction. The\\r\\nforeign colonies established on the adjoining shores of\\r\\nthe ocean are already uneasy at what His Majesty has done\\r\\nhere during the last seven years.\\' This confidence was\\r\\nprobably not shared by the king and his minister, for,\\r\\nin a letter to Frontenac some time later, Colbert\\r\\nremonstrated against long journeys to the upper St Lawrence\\r\\nand outlying settlements, and expressed his disapproval\\r\\nof discoveries far away in the interior of the continent\\r\\nwhere the French could never settle or remain. Undoubtedly\\r\\nit was wise to advise concentration, and Talon himself\\r\\nwould not have differed on that score from the minister.\\r\\nHe was too sagacious not to see that Canada with a small\\r\\npopulation should abstain from remote establishments.\\r\\nHis policy of exploration and discovery did not aim at\\r\\nthe immediate foundation of new colonies, but was only\\r\\ndirected towards increasing the prestige of the French\\r\\nname, developing trade, and thus preparing the way for\\r\\nthe future greatness of Canada. It was a far-sighted\\r\\npolicy, not seeking impossible achievements for to-day,\\r\\nbut gaining a foot-hold for those of to-morrow. That the\\r\\npolitical fabric of France in America was doomed to fall\\r\\nin no way dims the fame of the great intendant. Under\\r\\nhis powerful direction New France, through her missionaries,\\r\\nexplorers, and traders, stamped her mark over three-quarters\\r\\nof the territory then known as North America. Her moral,\\r\\npolitical, and commercial influence was felt beyond her\\r\\nboundaries\\xe2\\x80\\x94west, north, and south. She had hoisted the\\r\\ncross and the fleurs-de-lis from the sunny banks of the\\r\\nArkansas to the icy shores of Hudson Bay, and from the\\r\\nsurges of the Atlantic to the remotest limits of the\\r\\nGreat Lakes. Her unceasing activity and daring enterprise,\\r\\nsupplementing inferior numbers and wealth, gave her an\\r\\nundisputed superiority over the industrious English\\r\\ncolonies confined to their narrow strip between the\\r\\nAlleghanies and the sea; and her name inspired awe and\\r\\nrespect in a hundred Indian tribes.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00138\">What was Courcelle\\'s attitude towards the extraordinary\\r\\nactivity displayed by Talon? Evidently the intendant\\r\\noften acted the part of the governor; and the real\\r\\ngovernor, out-shone, could not conceal his ill-humour,\\r\\nand tried to assert his authority. There were several\\r\\nclashes between the two high officials. The governor\\r\\nfrequently lost his temper, while Talon complained of\\r\\nCourcelle\\'s jealousy and harshness. It must be admitted\\r\\nthat the great intendant, in his fervid zeal for the\\r\\npublic good and his passion for action, was not always\\r\\ncareful or tactful in his behaviour to the governor.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 id=\"id00139\" style=\"margin-top: 4em\">CHAPTER IX</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5 id=\"id00140\">TALON\\'S ADMINISTRATION ENDS</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00141\">In the survey of Talon\\'s first term of office mention\\r\\nwas made of the many enterprises he set on foot for the\\r\\ninternal progress of the colony. One of these was\\r\\nshipbuilding. During his second term a stronger impulse\\r\\nwas given to this industry. One of the intendant\\'s first\\r\\nofficial acts after his arrival in 1670 was to issue a\\r\\ndecree for the conservation of the forests suitable for\\r\\nshipbuilding purposes\\xe2\\x80\\x94to prohibit the felling of oak,\\r\\nelm, beech, and cherry trees until the skilled carpenters\\r\\nsent by the king should have inspected them and made\\r\\ntheir choice. It is interesting, too, to find that in\\r\\nall grants of land Talon inserted a clause reserving\\r\\nthese trees. Shipbuilding in Canada was to be encouraged\\r\\nand promoted. Had not Colbert given forty thousand livres\\r\\nfor the purpose? A shipyard was set up on the banks of\\r\\nthe St Charles river. Many ships were built there; at\\r\\nfirst only small ones, but the industry gradually developed.\\r\\nIn 1672 a ship of over four hundred tons was launched,\\r\\nand preparations had been made for another of eight\\r\\nhundred tons. Seven years earlier only nineteen out of\\r\\n2378 vessels in the French mercantile marine had exceeded\\r\\nfour hundred tons. The infant shipyard at Quebec was\\r\\ndoing well.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00142\">Agriculture and industry were flourishing in New France.\\r\\nHemp was being grown successfully, and a larger quantity\\r\\nof wool was made available by increasing flocks of sheep.\\r\\nThe intendant insisted that women and girls should be\\r\\ntaught to spin. He distributed looms to encourage the\\r\\npractice of weaving, and after a time the colony had\\r\\nhome-made carpets and table-covers of drugget, and serges\\r\\nand buntings. The great number of cattle ensured an\\r\\nabundance of raw hides. Accordingly the intendant\\r\\nestablished a tannery, and this in turn led to the\\r\\npreparation of leather and the making of shoes; so that\\r\\nin 1671 Talon could write to the king: \\'I am now clothed\\r\\nfrom foot to head with home-made articles.\\' Tobacco was\\r\\ngrown to some extent, but Colbert did not wish to encourage\\r\\nits cultivation by the Canadian farmers. The minister\\r\\nwas better pleased when the intendant wrote concerning\\r\\npotash and tar. A Sieur Nicolas Follin undertook to make\\r\\npotash out of wood ashes, and was granted a privilege\\r\\nwith a bounty of ten sous per ton and free entry into\\r\\nFrance for his product. The potash proved excellent. In\\r\\nthe meantime an expert on tar named Arnould Alix came\\r\\nfrom France and found that the Canadian trees were\\r\\neminently fit for the production of that article, so\\r\\nnecessary in shipbuilding; indeed at this time Colbert\\r\\nwas doing his best to manufacture it in France so that\\r\\nthe shipyards of the kingdom might use French tar instead\\r\\nof the foreign product. The news that it could be made\\r\\nin Canada was very welcome to the minister.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00143\">The intendant continued his search for mines, but without\\r\\nsubstantial results. There had been much talk of iron\\r\\nore at Baie Saint-Paul and also in the region of Three\\r\\nRivers. The Sieur de la Potardiere was sent to examine\\r\\nthese ores; but, although his report was favourable and\\r\\nColbert seemed highly interested and began to speak of\\r\\ncasting cannon on the shores of the Saint-Maurice, for\\r\\nsome reason nothing was done, and sixty years were to\\r\\nelapse before the establishment of the Saint-Maurice\\r\\nforges.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00144\">In another chapter we saw that Talon was always ready to\\r\\nhelp the religious institutions and that he was very\\r\\nfriendly towards the Hotel-Dieu at Quebec. This hospital\\r\\nhad become too small for the requirements of the growing\\r\\npopulation. At his own expense the intendant had a\\r\\nsubstantial wing erected, superintending the work himself\\r\\nand at the same time securing for the institution an\\r\\nabundant supply of water. The Ursulines also received\\r\\nample evidence of his goodwill and friendship. He was\\r\\ngreatly pleased with their Seminaire Sauvage (Indian\\r\\nseminary), where they displayed an unceasing zeal for\\r\\nthe instruction and civilization of the little red-skinned\\r\\ngirls. The Jesuit Relation of 1671 mentions the baptism\\r\\nof an Indian girl with her mother. Talon wished to be\\r\\ngodfather and asked Madame d\\'Ailleboust to act as godmother.\\r\\nLaval officiated. In 1671 the Ursulines had fifty Indian\\r\\ngirls in their Seminaire Sauvage, and in Montreal the\\r\\nSulpicians and the Sisters of the Congregation, as already\\r\\nnarrated, were devoting themselves to the Indian children.\\r\\nIn this good work the intendant was greatly interested.\\r\\nHe rejoiced in educational progress, as is shown by the\\r\\nfollowing from one of his letters to the king:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00145\" style=\"margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%\">   The Canadian youth are improving their knowledge. They\\r\\n   take to schools for sciences, arts, handicrafts, and\\r\\n   especially navigation; and if the movement is sustained\\r\\n   there is every reason to hope that this country will\\r\\n   produce mariners, fishermen, seamen, and skilled\\r\\n   workmen; for the youth here are naturally inclined to\\r\\n   these pursuits. The Sieur de Saint-Martin (a lay\\r\\n   brother at the Jesuits), who knows enough mathematics,\\r\\n   is going to give lessons at my request.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00146\">New France at this time was prosperous and happy. \\'Peace\\r\\nreigns within as well as without the colony,\\' wrote Talon\\r\\nat the end of the year 1671. There was work and activity\\r\\non all sides. New settlements were opened, new families\\r\\nwere founded, new industries were born. No wonder that\\r\\nTalon, when he reflected on what had been achieved in\\r\\nseven years, should have written: \\'This portion of the\\r\\nFrench monarchy is going to become something great.\\'</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00147\">Unfortunately his activities and service in Canada were\\r\\nnearing their end. His health was breaking down. Louis\\r\\nXIV had promised that he should be relieved from his\\r\\narduous task in two years. Talon reminded his royal master\\r\\nof this promise, and on May 17, 1672, the king was pleased\\r\\nto give him permission to come home. Courcelle had asked\\r\\nfor his own recall; his request was also granted and the\\r\\nComte de Frontenac was named in his stead. No intendant\\r\\nwas appointed to fill Talon\\'s place. At the beginning of\\r\\nSeptember 1672, while Talon had still two months to serve,\\r\\nFrontenac arrived in Quebec to take up his duties as the\\r\\nsole executive head of the colony. [Footnote: Another\\r\\nvolume of this Series, The Fighting Governor, tells of\\r\\nwhat happened in New France in Frontenac\\'s time.]</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00148\">One of Talon\\'s last official acts was the allotment,\\r\\nunder authority of a decree of the King\\'s Council of\\r\\nState, of a large number of seigneuries\\xe2\\x80\\x94a matter of the\\r\\nhighest importance for the development of the colony. He\\r\\nset himself to the task with his usual activity and\\r\\nearnestness. From October 10 to November 8 he authorized\\r\\nabout sixty seigneurial concessions to officers and others\\r\\ndesirous of forming settlements. In one day alone (November\\r\\n3) he made thirty-one grants. The autumn of 1672, during\\r\\nwhich all these seigneuries were created, should be\\r\\nremembered in the history of New France. Before Talon,\\r\\nit is true, seigneurial grants had been made in Canada,\\r\\nbut only intermittently and without any preconceived plan\\r\\nor well-defined object. Now it was quite different. The\\r\\ngrants made by Talon, and the way in which they were\\r\\nmade, show clearly the execution of a well thought-out\\r\\nscheme. If Talon was not the founder he was the organizer\\r\\nof the seigneurial institution in Canada. The object was\\r\\ntwofold\\xe2\\x80\\x94to protect and to colonize the country. By his\\r\\nconcessions to Sorel, Chambly, Varennes, Saint-Ours,\\r\\nContrecoeur\\xe2\\x80\\x94all officers of the Carignan regiment\\xe2\\x80\\x94he\\r\\ncreated so many little military colonies whose population\\r\\nwould be composed chiefly of disbanded soldiers. These,\\r\\nbeing warriors as well as farmers, would be a strong\\r\\nbarrier against possible Iroquois incursions. His second\\r\\nobject, to stimulate colonization in general, was\\r\\nanticipated by a provision\\xe2\\x80\\x94inserted in each grant\\xe2\\x80\\x94that\\r\\nthe seigneurs should live on their domains, and that\\r\\ntheir tenants should do the same; this would mean the\\r\\nplanting of many new settlements on both shores of the\\r\\nSt Lawrence. It was a sound policy. For over a century\\r\\nthe seigneurial system was to Canada a source of strength\\r\\nand progress. [Footnote: This view is fully sustained\\r\\nby Prof. W. B. Munro of Harvard University, who has made\\r\\nan exhaustive study of the subject. The reader is referred\\r\\nto the narrative of The Seigneurs of Old Canada in the\\r\\npresent Series, written by him.] Its organization was\\r\\nthe crowning work of the intendant Talon in New France.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00149\">Talon\\'s task was over. He had happily fulfilled his\\r\\nmission. He had set government and justice upon a foundation\\r\\nwhich was to last until the fall of the old regime. He\\r\\nhad given a mighty impulse to agriculture, colonization,\\r\\ntrade, industry, naval construction. He had encouraged\\r\\neducational and charitable institutions, created new\\r\\ncentres of population, strengthened the frontiers of\\r\\nCanada, and, with admirable forethought, had prepared\\r\\nthe way for the future extension and growth of the colony.\\r\\nHe has had his critics. The word paternalism has been\\r\\nused to describe the system carried out by him and by\\r\\nColbert. He has been accused of having too willingly\\r\\nsubstituted governmental action for individual activity.\\r\\nBut, taking into consideration the time and circumstances,\\r\\nsuch criticism is not justified. When Talon came to\\r\\nCanada, the colony was dying. A policy of ensuring\\r\\nprotection, of liberal and continuous subvention, of\\r\\nintelligent state initiative, was a necessity of the\\r\\nhour. Everywhere ground had to be broken, and the government\\r\\nalone could do it. The policy of Colbert and Talon saved\\r\\nthe colony.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00150\">The great intendant left Canada in November 1672. It was\\r\\na mournful day for New France. In recognition of his\\r\\nservices the king had made a barony of his estate, \\'des\\r\\nIslets,\\' and had created him Baron des Islets. Later on\\r\\nhe became Comte d\\'Orsainville. He had previously been\\r\\nappointed Captain of the Mariemont Castle.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00151\">Talon never came back to Canada. Louis XIV and Colbert\\r\\nreceived him with expressions of the greatest satisfaction.\\r\\nAfter a time he became premier valet de la garde-robe du\\r\\nroi (first valet of the king\\'s wardrobe), and finally he\\r\\nattained the coveted office of secretary of the king\\'s\\r\\ncabinet. He died on November 24, 1694, at the age of\\r\\nabout sixty-nine years, twenty-two years after his\\r\\ndeparture from Canada.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00152\">Jean Talon is one of the great names in Canadian\\r\\nhistory\\xe2\\x80\\x94the name of one of the makers of Canada.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2 id=\"id00153\" style=\"margin-top: 4em\">BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p id=\"id00154\">The author\\'s larger work, \\'Jean Talon, Intendant de la\\r\\nNouvelle France\\', is the principal source of information\\r\\nfor the foregoing narrative.

It\\r\\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\\r\\nfrom people in all walks of life.\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 and future\\r\\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\\r\\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div style=\"display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold\">\\r\\nSection 3.

The Foundation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\\r\\nU.S. federal laws and your state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s laws.\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\\r\\nThe Foundation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\\r\\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\\r\\nProject Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\\r\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\r\\nvisit <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/\">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\\r\\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div style=\"display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold\">\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 electronic works\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\\r\\nGutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\\r\\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\\r\\nProject Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org\">www.gutenberg.org</a>.\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n<div style=\"display:block; margin:1em 0\">\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\\xe2\\x84\\xa2,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n\\r\\n</section></body></html>\\r\\n'\n"
